          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>Nicaragua remains Central America's most authentic, least-touristed destination—a country of poets, revolutionaries, colonial grandeur, and volcanic landscapes that feels decades removed from the packaged tourism of its neighbors. Corinto, a working port city on the Pacific side, serves as the cruise gateway to Nicaragua's treasures, particularly the colonial city of León, one of the oldest Spanish settlements in the Americas. The morning I stepped ashore, I could smell diesel from the cargo cranes mixed with salt air from the Pacific, and I knew immediately this would not be a polished port experience. Nicaragua shows you its real face: crumbling colonial facades beside revolutionary murals, horse-drawn carriages sharing streets with vintage American cars, indigenous markets selling hand-ground cacao, and volcanoes—so many volcanoes—dominating every horizon.</p>

            <p>My driver navigated the twenty miles inland to León, and with every mile the landscape shifted from industrial port to lush countryside. We passed roadside stands selling fresh fruit, Catholic shrines decorated with plastic flowers, and weathered billboards bearing political slogans faded by tropical sun. When we reached León's central plaza, I understood immediately why this city captivates travelers. The massive white facade of Basílica Catedral de la Asunción—the largest cathedral in Central America and a UNESCO site—dominated the square, its twin towers framing a sky punctuated by distant volcanic peaks. The scent of incense drifted from the open doors, mixing with the aroma of coffee from nearby cafes.</p>

            <p>I climbed to the cathedral's rooftop and walked among the brilliant white domes, terracotta rooftops spreading below, the volcanic chain of Maribios marching northwest into the haze. Church bells tolled, pelicans circled overhead, street vendors called their wares from the plaza. That rooftop moment—wind lifting dust from colonial streets, the weight of five centuries of history pressing down, beauty and struggle intertwined in every direction—captured Nicaragua's contradictions. My breath caught in my throat. I felt tears welling, unexpected and unwelcome, as the profound sadness and stubborn hope of this place washed over me. Spanish colonizers built this monument to their faith; Nicaraguan people claimed it as their own. Rubén Darío, the father of Spanish-language modernism and Nicaragua's beloved poet, lies entombed in the cathedral's crypts, guarded by a mournful stone lion.</p>

            <p>The afternoon brought volcano boarding at Cerro Negro—Central America's youngest and most active volcano, formed only in 1850. Our guide handed us protective suits, goggles, and wooden boards after we'd hiked forty-five minutes up the black cinder cone, volcanic gravel crunching beneath our boots, sulfur vapor rising from vents near the crater. Then we sat at the top of a forty-one-degree slope and pushed off, accelerating down the mountainside in a cloud of black dust, wind screaming past, board vibrating beneath me, heart pounding with pure adrenaline. I reached nearly forty miles per hour before skidding to a stop at the bottom, covered head to toe in volcanic ash, grinning like an idiot. It's absurd. It's slightly dangerous. It's completely unique to Nicaragua. And it's the most fun I've ever had on a volcano.</p>

            <p>León's revolutionary heritage revealed itself at the Museo de la Revolución, run by Sandinista veterans who lived the events they describe. The rooftop still bears bullet holes from the 1978-79 civil war against the Somoza dictatorship. Our guide, who fought in those battles as a teenager, showed us photographs of friends who didn't survive, weapons captured from the National Guard, the radio equipment that broadcast revolutionary messages across the country. His eyes shone with conviction even forty years later. I'm not qualified to judge the politics, but the personal courage was unmistakable. This is a country that has suffered enormously and continues to navigate difficult choices.</p>

            <p>The Pettah markets consumed my final hours—chaotic stalls selling handmade pottery, leather goods, hammocks, and the ingredients for traditional Nicaraguan cooking. I bought cacao ground by hand, watching an elderly woman work a stone metate just as her ancestors did centuries before the Spanish arrived. A vendor pressed fresh mango into my hand, refusing payment, simply wanting me to taste something delicious from her country. That generosity, offered freely from a woman who clearly had little, touched me deeply. Nicaragua asks nothing of its visitors except open eyes and open hearts.</p>

            <p>The sunset found me at Las Peñitas, a Pacific surf town twenty minutes from León, watching waves crash against dark volcanic sand. The light turned golden, then orange, then the deep purple of tropical twilight. Surfers carved silhouettes against the dying light. For the first time in that intense day, I felt peaceful—not the manufactured peace of a resort, but something earned through honest engagement with a complex, beautiful, wounded, hopeful place.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing on León Cathedral's rooftop, wind lifting volcanic dust, church bells tolling, feeling the weight of centuries pressing down while also sensing the stubborn hope that keeps Nicaraguans building, creating, believing. My heart swelled with gratitude for places like this—places that don't pretend, that show you their scars alongside their beauty, that trust you to handle the full truth of human experience. If you seek the authentic soul of Central America, Nicaragua delivers it without pretense or apology.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock directly at Corinto's main pier, Nicaragua's principal Pacific port facility. This is a working cargo port that handles cruise ships—expect basic terminal amenities rather than resort-style facilities. Taxis gather at the terminal, and ship-organized excursions depart from designated areas. The terminal offers minimal services: restrooms, a small vendor area, and currency exchange.</p>

            <p>León, the primary tourist destination, lies 20 miles inland—about a 40-minute drive on paved roads. Most cruise lines strongly recommend organized excursions given the distance, language barriers (Spanish dominates; English is limited outside tours), and navigation challenges. Independent travel is possible but requires planning, Spanish language ability, and reliable transportation arrangements made in advance. The port area itself offers little of interest to tourists—Corinto town has basic services but no significant attractions.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Corinto is essentially a transit point to León and Nicaragua's volcanic attractions. The port area itself offers nothing for tourists—plan to travel inland immediately. Transportation options require advance consideration given language barriers and limited tourist infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Organized tours:</strong> Highly recommended for most visitors. Ship excursions handle all logistics including transportation, guides, and safety equipment for activities like volcano boarding. Local tour operators offer similar services at lower prices but require advance booking. Tours eliminate language barriers and ensure guaranteed return to the ship—critical given the 40-minute drive from León.</p>

            <p><strong>By taxi:</strong> Available at the port. Negotiate a fixed fare to León before departing—expect $40-60 USD round-trip for a car. Some taxi drivers will offer informal guided tours. Verify the driver will wait and return you to the port. Share rides with fellow passengers to reduce costs. Most drivers speak limited English.</p>

            <p><strong>Car with driver:</strong> Arranged through ship excursion desk or local tour operators. Provides flexibility to customize your itinerary. Expect $60-100 USD for a full day. Driver handles navigation and provides local knowledge. Recommended for independent travelers who want control over their schedule but don't want to navigate unfamiliar roads.</p>

            <p><strong>Mobility considerations:</strong> León's colonial streets are uneven cobblestones presenting challenges for wheelchairs and mobility devices. The cathedral rooftop walk involves stairs with no elevator alternative. Volcano excursions require hiking on loose volcanic gravel—not accessible for mobility-limited visitors. Low-stamina visitors can enjoy León's cathedral interior, plaza, and markets without extensive walking, but getting around independently requires taxi transport between sites. Ship excursions can accommodate some mobility needs with advance notice.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>León was founded in 1524 by Spanish conquistador Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, making it one of the oldest European settlements in the Americas. The original city was abandoned after volcanic eruptions in 1610, and León was rebuilt at its present location. For three centuries, León competed with Granada for political and economic dominance of Nicaragua—a rivalry that defined the nation's development and occasionally erupted into armed conflict.</p>

            <p>The cathedral construction began in 1747 and took a full century to complete. Its massive fortress-like design was deliberate—Spanish colonizers built to withstand earthquakes and potential attacks. Inside, Rubén Darío's tomb draws literary pilgrims from throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Darío revolutionized Spanish-language poetry in the late 19th century, and Nicaraguans revere him as their greatest cultural figure.</p>

            <p>Nicaragua's modern turmoil has marked León deeply. The Sandinista revolution of 1978-79 saw heavy fighting in the city's streets. Bullet holes still scar the Museo de la Revolución. The subsequent Contra War, U.S. economic sanctions, natural disasters, and recent political crises have tested Nicaraguan resilience repeatedly. Yet the warmth visitors experience today has survived—even strengthened through hardship. This is a country of poets and revolutionaries, of colonial grandeur and volcanic fire, of suffering and stubborn hope. Corinto opens the door to all of it.</p>

          <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
          <p>Book ship excursion to colonial León (UNESCO cathedral, rooftop walk) plus volcano boarding at Cerro Negro if adventurous. Nicaragua is authentic and affordable but requires organized transport from Corinto port.</p>
