      "markdown": "**Queen Anne launched in 2024 as Cunard's 249th ship—and the first time the company has operated four ocean-going vessels simultaneously.**\n\nCunard's history spans 185 years of Atlantic crossing and global cruising. But until Queen Anne's arrival, the fleet never exceeded three ships. Queen Anne changes that equation, expanding capacity while maintaining the Cunard standards that define the brand.\n\nHer name honors Queen Anne of Great Britain, who reigned during Britain's emergence as naval power. The naming continues Cunard tradition: every ship since 1934 carries a Queen name, honoring British monarchs who understood maritime importance.\n\n[Queen Mary 2](/ships/cunard/queen-mary-2.html) serves transatlantic crossings. [Queen Victoria](/ships/cunard/queen-victoria.html) and [Queen Elizabeth](/ships/cunard/queen-elizabeth.html) cruise worldwide. Queen Anne expands that cruising capacity, enabling itineraries the three-ship fleet couldn't serve.\n\nFor Cunard loyalists, Queen Anne represents historic expansion. For newcomers, she offers the newest expression of the world's oldest cruise brand.",

      "core_insight": "Queen Anne introduces contemporary design while maintaining Cunard's signature elegance",
      "markdown": "**Queen Anne looks different from her sisters. The modernity is intentional—and carefully balanced with Cunard tradition.**\n\nThe Grand Lobby maintains the dramatic entrance expected on Cunard ships but interprets it with contemporary materials and lighting. The Queen's Room continues traditional afternoon tea but in space designed for 21st-century aesthetics.\n\nNew venues appear that don't exist on the older Queens. The Bright Lights Society offers entertainment lounge experiences distinct from traditional show formats. The Pavilion provides flexible social space that adapts throughout the day.\n\nBut Cunard fundamentals persist. Dress codes maintain formal dining culture. The library remains substantial rather than token. The promenade decks allow proper walking. White-gloved service appears where tradition demands it.\n\nQueen Anne navigates the challenge all heritage brands face: how to evolve without betraying identity. The balance works. She feels contemporary but undeniably Cunard.\n\nFor travelers seeking Cunard tradition with modern expression: Queen Anne delivers both. For those seeking the older Queens' more traditional aesthetic, [Queen Victoria](/ships/cunard/queen-victoria.html) and [Queen Elizabeth](/ships/cunard/queen-elizabeth.html) remain excellent choices.",

      "markdown": "**I'd never cruised Cunard. Friends said it was stuffy. Queen Anne proved them wrong—while still feeling special.**\n\nThe formality exists but doesn't oppress. Yes, dress codes apply. Yes, afternoon tea maintains ritual. Yes, the dining room expects appropriate attire. But the atmosphere feels celebratory rather than restrictive. People *want* to dress up.\n\nThe service style differs from other cruise lines I've tried. More British reserve, less American enthusiasm. Crew don't perform—they serve. The difference is subtle but noticeable. You're not being entertained constantly; you're being cared for quietly.\n\nQueens Grill and Princess Grill provide premium dining for higher cabin categories—a system some find elitist, others find appropriate. Britannia Club offers middle-ground. Standard Britannia Restaurant serves everyone else excellently.\n\nQueen Anne's newer design makes Cunard traditions more accessible. The ship feels less intimidating than I expected. The formality invites rather than excludes.\n\nFor first-timers: Cunard isn't for everyone. The pace is slower. The dress codes are real. The atmosphere trends older and more formal. But if those elements appeal rather than repel, Queen Anne provides excellent introduction.",
