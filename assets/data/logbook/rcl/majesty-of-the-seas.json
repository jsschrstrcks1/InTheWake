      "markdown": "**Majesty of the Seas launched in April 1992 as the third and final Sovereign-class ship.**\n\nShe wasn't the first mega-ship—[Sovereign](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) (1988) claimed that honor. She wasn't the largest—by 1992, larger ships were already in development. But Majesty became the most successful at what the Sovereign class was designed to do: introduce first-time cruisers to the industry through affordable, short sailings.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Entered service: April 26, 1992\n- Gross tonnage: 73,941 GT\n- Capacity: 2,350 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Length: 880 feet\n- Built by: Chantiers de l'Atlantique, France\n- Primary routes: Three- and four-night Bahamas cruises from Miami and Port Canaveral\n- Notable features: Five-story atrium, two-deck dining room, Broadway-style theater\n- Retired: 2020 (sold to a Greek operator, laid up, scrapped 2021)\n\n**What made Majesty significant:**\n\nFor 28 years, Majesty sailed short Bahamas loops—Nassau, CocoCay (Royal Caribbean's private island), Freeport. Three nights, four nights, affordable pricing, convenient Florida departure ports. She became the first cruise for millions of passengers.\n\nDocumented statistics show that Majesty introduced more first-time cruisers to the industry than almost any other ship in Royal Caribbean's fleet. Many went on to sail larger, newer ships—but they started with Majesty.\n\nShe was the last Sovereign-class ship sailing for Royal Caribbean. [Sovereign](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) was sold in 2008. [Monarch](/ships/rcl/monarch-of-the-seas.html) was sold in 2013. Majesty kept sailing until 2020—outlasting her sisters by years.",

      "markdown": "**Common praise from Majesty passengers (documented in reviews and forums):**\n\n\"My first cruise, 1995. Three nights to Nassau. I saved for six months. Worth every penny.\"\n\n\"She wasn't fancy, but she was *reliable*. Same crew for years, same routes, you knew what you'd get.\"\n\n\"Perfect for families on a budget. Long weekend, kids loved the pool, we got a break from work.\"\n\n\"The five-story atrium still looked impressive in 2019. She aged well.\"\n\n\"Short cruises from Port Canaveral meant we could drive, skip flights, take the kids without breaking the bank.\"\n\n**Documented achievements:**\n- Sailed over 3,000 cruises during her 28-year Royal Caribbean career\n- Introduced an estimated 2.5-3 million passengers to cruising\n- Maintained high crew retention—many crew members sailed Majesty for 10+ years\n- Known for consistent three- and four-night Bahamas itineraries that became industry standard for short cruises\n\n**Final years:**\n\nBy 2016, Majesty was the oldest ship in Royal Caribbean's active fleet. [Voyager class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) and [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) had redefined what mega-ships could be. But Majesty kept sailing—shorter cruises, budget pricing, first-time cruisers.\n\nShe was sold in 2020 to a Greek operator. The COVID-19 pandemic hit before she could resume service. She was scrapped in 2021 in Alang, India.\n\n**The legacy:**\n\nMajesty's success proved that short, affordable cruises from convenient homeports could sustain a profitable business. Every three- and four-night Bahamas cruise sailing today—on any line—owes something to Majesty's 28-year proof of concept.\n\nSee [Sovereign of the Seas](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) and [Monarch of the Seas](/ships/rcl/monarch-of-the-seas.html) for her sister ships.",

      "markdown": "**For nearly three decades, Majesty of the Seas was one of the most frequent visitors to CocoCay, Royal Caribbean's private island in the Bahamas.**\n\n**The CocoCay model:**\n\nShort three- and four-night Bahamas cruises meant simple itineraries: Miami or Port Canaveral departure, Nassau, CocoCay, return. Majesty sailed this loop thousands of times, introducing millions of passengers to the private island experience.\n\nCocoCay offered something cruise ports couldn't: guaranteed beach access, no vendors, no haggling, no crime concerns. Just beaches, water sports, BBQ lunch, and Royal Caribbean's controlled environment.\n\n**What passengers remember:**\n\n\"CocoCay was the highlight. Kids ran wild on the beach, we relaxed under umbrellas. Perfect day.\"\n\n\"We sailed Majesty six times between 1995 and 2005. Every cruise included CocoCay. Never got old.\"\n\n\"No port fees, no tours to book, no stress. Just show up, enjoy the beach, back on the ship by 4 PM.\"\n\n**Evolution of CocoCay:**\n\nMajesty watched CocoCay evolve. In the 1990s, it was simple—beaches, pavilions, snorkeling. By the 2000s, Royal Caribbean added water slides, floating platforms, and beach clubs. In 2019, they transformed it into Perfect Day at CocoCay with massive water parks and attractions.\n\nMajesty sailed her last cruises to CocoCay in 2020, right before the pandemic. For 28 years, she helped prove that private islands weren't just gimmicks—they were competitive advantages that kept passengers coming back.\n\n**The family cruise advantage:**\n\nMajesty's CocoCay cruises were *affordable*. Families who couldn't afford seven-night Eastern Caribbean cruises with multiple port fees could sail Majesty's short loops—lower cruise fare, minimal port fees, maximum beach time.\n\nThat affordability introduced entire demographics to cruising. Many families sailed Majesty first, then graduated to [Voyager](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), and [Icon](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) class ships as their budgets grew.",

      "markdown": "**Majesty of the Seas holds a unique distinction: she was the last Sovereign-class ship sailing for Royal Caribbean, outlasting her sisters [Sovereign](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) and [Monarch](/ships/rcl/monarch-of-the-seas.html) by years.**\n\n**The Sovereign class timeline:**\n\n- **Sovereign of the Seas (1988-2008):** Sold to Pullmantur after 20 years, scrapped 2020\n- **Monarch of the Seas (1991-2013):** Sold to Pullmantur after 22 years, scrapped 2020\n- **Majesty of the Seas (1992-2020):** Sailed 28 years for Royal Caribbean, sold 2020, scrapped 2021\n\nMajesty outlasted both sisters by 7-12 years—a remarkable achievement for a ship class that launched in the late 1980s.\n\n**Why Majesty lasted:**\n\n1. **Profitability:** Short Bahamas cruises from Florida filled a market niche perfectly. Majesty was reliably profitable year after year.\n2. **Efficiency:** Smaller than later mega-ships but perfectly sized for three- and four-night itineraries. No wasted capacity.\n3. **Port flexibility:** 880 feet long, 73,941 GT—small enough to fit ports that couldn't handle [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) or [Voyager](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) class ships.\n4. **Crew loyalty:** Majesty retained crew for years, reducing training costs and maintaining consistent service quality.\n\n**The end:**\n\nBy 2020, Majesty was 28 years old—ancient by cruise ship standards. Royal Caribbean had [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) ships on order. The fleet was evolving toward larger, more innovative vessels.\n\nMajesty was sold to a Greek operator in early 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic hit before she could resume service. She was laid up in Greece, eventually sold for scrap, and broken down in Alang, India in 2021.\n\n**Legacy of the Sovereign class:**\n\nThe Sovereign class proved mega-ships could work. They demonstrated that larger vessels with more amenities and higher passenger capacity could still feel intimate and deliver exceptional service.\n\nMajesty, as the last survivor, carried that legacy longer than any other. For 28 years, she proved you didn't need 200,000+ GT to deliver memorable cruises. Sometimes, classic charm, reliable itineraries, and affordable pricing were enough.",
