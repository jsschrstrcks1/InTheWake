    <article class="card"><h1>Puerto Limón: Where the Rainforest Meets the Sea</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Puerto Limón doesn't pretend to be a postcard. This is Costa Rica's main Caribbean port, a working harbor that has moved bananas, coffee, and cargo since the railroad connected it to San José in 1871. The town itself is rough around the edges — paint peeling from shutters, streets cracked and uneven, a grittiness that feels honest after the polished tourist towns of the Pacific coast. But that's not why you're here. You're here because thirty minutes inland, the rainforest waits — dripping, screaming with howler monkeys, crawling with sloths, alive in a way that makes you remember what "wild" actually means.</p>

        <p>I stepped off the ship into humid air thick enough to wrap around you like a blanket. The cruise terminal sits right on the waterfront, a modern facility built to handle the parade of ships that arrive throughout the dry season (December through April, when the Caribbean side gets less rain). Security is visible, reassuring — Puerto Limón has struggled with crime, and the port authority knows it. Most cruisers don't linger in town. They're headed to the rainforest, and so was I.</p>

        <p>My excursion took me to Veragua Rainforest Park, about an hour's drive through banana plantations that stretched to the horizon — Costa Rica is the world's second-largest banana exporter, and you see why. The plantations gave way to dense jungle, and suddenly we were riding an aerial tram through the canopy, gliding silently above treetops where toucans perched and morpho butterflies flashed electric blue. The guide pointed out a three-toed sloth clinging to a cecropia tree, moving so slowly it seemed frozen in time. Later, we zip-lined through the same canopy, adrenaline replacing reverence, screaming through green tunnels of life.</p>

        <p>Back at the park's research station, I held a poison dart frog no bigger than my thumbnail — bright red, impossibly beautiful, lethal enough to kill ten men if it wanted to. The herpetologist explained that captive-bred frogs lose their toxicity without the specific rainforest diet that creates it. I thought about that as I watched a sloth being rehabilitated at the rescue center — how place shapes everything, how you can't separate a creature from where it belongs.</p>

        <p>On another visit, I took a boat tour through the Tortuguero canals, a network of jungle waterways north of Limón that feels like something out of a fever dream. Our guide cut the motor and we drifted in silence, water the color of strong tea, vines draping into the current. A caiman floated past, eyes above the waterline like periscopes. Howler monkeys roared from the canopy — a sound so deep and primal it resonates in your chest. We spotted Jesus Christ lizards running across the water's surface on their hind legs, defying physics for a few breathless seconds before diving under.</p>

        <p>Puerto Limón itself — the town, not the excursions — is a study in Afro-Caribbean culture that most cruise visitors never see. The railroad brought Jamaican workers in the 1870s to build the tracks through impossible jungle, and their descendants shaped this coast's identity: calypso music, rice and beans cooked in coconut milk, a patois that mixes Spanish and English and Jamaican Creole. Parque Vargas, right by the port, has massive trees draped with sloths (yes, in town!) and iguanas sunbathing on the seawall. But honestly, unless you're particularly interested in the cultural history or want to grab some local food, the rainforest is the point.</p>

        <p>The pros: This is one of the best ports for experiencing Costa Rica's legendary biodiversity — sloths, monkeys, rainforest, canals, zip-lines, rescue centers. The excursions are genuinely extraordinary. The cons: The town itself is not tourist-friendly, safety concerns are real, and the port experience is purely functional. Come for the jungle, not the city.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Floating in silence through the Tortuguero canals at dawn, mist rising from water that's been flowing through this jungle for millennia, watching a sloth slowly — impossibly slowly — reach for a cecropia leaf. Our guide whispered that we were the first boat of the day, and the rainforest was waking up around us: macaws calling, howlers roaring, the whole symphony of life that existed before humans and will exist after we're gone. For ten perfect minutes, we were just witnesses, and that felt like enough.

        <h3>Getting Around Puerto Limón</h3>
        <p>The cruise terminal is walkable to downtown Puerto Limón — about 10-15 minutes to Parque Vargas and the central market. However, most cruisers book excursions rather than exploring the town independently due to safety concerns. The terminal area itself is well-secured with visible police presence during cruise calls.</p>

        <p>For excursions: Ship-organized tours pick you up at the terminal. If you book independently, arrange transportation through reputable tour operators — don't accept rides from unlicensed taxi drivers approaching at the port. All the major rainforest destinations (Veragua, Cahuita National Park, Tortuguero) require 1-2 hour drives or boat rides from the port.</p>

        <p>If you do venture into town, travel in groups during daylight hours only, keep valuables hidden, and don't wander into residential neighborhoods away from the main commercial streets around Parque Vargas and the market. The Caribbean vibe is real — calypso music, street vendors selling coconut rice and patties — but stay aware of your surroundings.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Puerto Limón is humid year-round. The Caribbean side gets less rain than the Pacific during dry season (December-April), but expect afternoon showers even in "dry" season. Dress in lightweight, quick-dry clothes. The rainforest excursions are hot and muggy — hydrate constantly.</p>

        <p><strong>Excursion timing:</strong> Rainforest tours typically run 4-6 hours including drive time. Morning tours are cooler and wildlife is more active. Book early — the best excursions (Veragua, Tortuguero) sell out quickly on ship itineraries.</p>

        <p><strong>What to bring:</strong> Rain jacket or poncho, sturdy closed-toe shoes (trails can be muddy), sunscreen, insect repellent with DEET, cash for tips and souvenirs. Waterproof phone case recommended for boat tours.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Costa Rican Colón (CRC), but US dollars widely accepted. Credit cards work at organized tour sites. Bring small bills ($1, $5) for tips — guides work hard for them.</p>

        <p><strong>Wildlife expectations:</strong> Sloths are nearly guaranteed at sanctuaries and Veragua. Monkeys (howler, capuchin, spider) are common. Toucans, poison dart frogs, iguanas very likely. Jaguars and pumas exist but are extremely rare sightings. The rainforest delivers.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Puerto Limón worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely — if you go beyond the port itself. Puerto Limón is your gateway to Costa Rica's Caribbean rainforest: sloths at rescue centers, Tortuguero's jungle canals, zip-line canopy tours, and vibrant Afro-Caribbean culture. The excursions are the point, not the town.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What are the best excursions from Puerto Limón?</strong><br/>A: Top picks: Veragua Rainforest with aerial tram and zip-lines, sloth sanctuaries (nearly guaranteed sightings), Tortuguero canals boat tour through jungle waterways, and banana plantation tours. The rainforest and wildlife are extraordinary — book through the ship or reputable operators.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can you see sloths in Puerto Limón?</strong><br/>A: Yes! Sloth sanctuaries and rescue centers near Puerto Limón offer close-up encounters with two-toed and three-toed sloths. Many rainforest excursions also include sloth spotting in the wild. Even Parque Vargas in town sometimes has sloths in the trees.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is it safe to walk around Puerto Limón?</strong><br/>A: The immediate port area is patrolled and generally safe during cruise calls, but Puerto Limón has higher crime rates than other Costa Rican destinations. Most cruisers book excursions rather than exploring independently. If you do walk into town, stay aware, travel in groups, and avoid wandering far from the terminal.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should I wear for rainforest excursions?</strong><br/>A: Lightweight, moisture-wicking clothes, sturdy closed-toe shoes (not sandals — trails are muddy), hat, sunglasses. Layers are good — it's hot but air-conditioned buses are cold. Bring a rain jacket. Long pants help with bug bites and scratches on jungle trails.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How long are the excursions from Puerto Limón?</strong><br/>A: Most rainforest tours run 4-6 hours total including 1-2 hours of drive time each way. Tortuguero canal tours are longer (6-7 hours) due to the boat journey. Budget your whole port day for excursions — they're worth it.</p>

    <h3>Author's Note</h3>
    <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
      I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. I visited Puerto Limón once on a Caribbean cruise, experiencing both the rainforest excursions and the town itself. The details reflect what I found on the ground — the humid air wrapping around you at the terminal, the extraordinary sloths at the rescue center, the primal roar of howler monkeys echoing through Tortuguero's canals, the honest grittiness of a working port that doesn't polish itself for tourists. The rainforest here is as alive and wild as any place I've been, and that ten-minute drift through dawn mist on the jungle canals remains one of my most treasured cruise memories.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Puerto Limón is your gateway to Costa Rica's Caribbean rainforest — sloths, monkeys, jungle canals, zip-lines, and the kind of wild that makes you remember what alive means. The port town is functional; the rainforest is extraordinary.
