        <h1>Galveston: Texas's Gateway to the Western Caribbean</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>I've sailed from many ports, but Galveston holds a special place in my logbook — this is where the Gulf Coast meets Caribbean dreams without the need to fly east. The oldest cruise port on the Gulf of Mexico, established in 1825, Galveston has welcomed ships for two centuries. Today it's the fourth busiest cruise port in America, handling over a million passengers annually.</p>

          <p>What strikes me most is the island's resilience. I walk the Strand District — a National Historic Landmark lined with Victorian iron-front buildings — and I'm reminded that this place once rivaled New York in wealth and grandeur. Before the Great Storm of 1900, Galveston was the second richest city per capita in America, the "Wall Street of the South," where cotton kings and shipping barons built empires.</p>

          <p>Three major cruise lines operate from Galveston's two terminals, sailing to <a href="/ports/cozumel.html">Cozumel</a>, <a href="/ports/costa-maya.html">Costa Maya</a>, <a href="/ports/roatan.html">Roatán</a>, and beyond. Houston's airports are just an hour away, and for Texans, this is home waters — the obvious choice for Caribbean cruising.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>Texas-Sized Tip:</strong> The Strand District is your pre-cruise playground — Victorian buildings, fantastic restaurants, and the best antique shopping in Texas. I always budget an extra afternoon to wander these iron-front facades.

          <h3>Pre-Cruise Activities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Strand District:</strong> This National Historic Landmark is where I always begin. These 19th-century Victorian iron-front commercial buildings — once the offices of cotton brokers and shipping magnates — now house restaurants, galleries, and shops. Texas's largest collection of iron-front commercial architecture survived the 1900 hurricane and stands as a testament to Galveston's golden age. Walk these streets and you're walking where fortunes were made in the 1880s.</li>
            <li><strong>Moody Gardens:</strong> The Moody family's gift to Galveston — three distinctive glass pyramids housing an aquarium, rainforest, and discovery center. Also features IMAX, ropes course, and palm beach. A living legacy of the family that helped rebuild this island after 1900.</li>
            <li><strong>Galveston Island State Park:</strong> 2,000 acres of beach, bay, and wetlands — excellent birding, kayaking, camping. <a href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/galveston-island" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Parks & Wildlife</a></li>
            <li><strong>Bishop's Palace:</strong> I never miss this. A stunning 1892 Victorian mansion built for lawyer Walter Gresham — one of America's most significant Victorian structures. It survived the Great Storm when lesser buildings were swept into the Gulf.</li>
            <li><strong>Seawall:</strong> Walk all 10 miles if you have time. This massive 17-foot barrier, built between 1902 and 1961 after the devastating 1900 hurricane, saved Galveston from future storms. Today it's beaches, restaurants, and Gulf views — but I always remember it's also a monument to engineering determination.</li>
            <li><strong>Pleasure Pier:</strong> Amusement park extending over the Gulf with rides, games, and restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>1877 Tall Ship Elissa:</strong> Iron-hulled sailing ship at the Texas Seaport Museum — one of the oldest merchant vessels still sailing. A beautiful reminder of Galveston's maritime heritage.</li>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
          <p>I often think about what Galveston was before the storm. Established in 1825 as the oldest port on the Gulf of Mexico, this island became Texas's first city — its first capital, its wealthiest jewel. By the 1890s, Galveston was the second richest city per capita in the entire United States, the "Wall Street of the South," where cotton fortunes were made and lost, where grand Victorian mansions lined Broadway, and where European immigrants first stepped onto American soil.</p>

          <p>Then came September 8, 1900. The deadliest natural disaster in American history struck without warning — a hurricane that killed between 6,000 and 8,000 souls when the Gulf simply rose up and swallowed the island. Entire neighborhoods vanished. Bodies were found weeks later, miles inland. The storm destroyed the wealthiest city in Texas in a single night.</p>

          <p>But here's what moves me: they rebuilt. Not just rebuilt — they engineered a miracle. Over the next decade, they constructed a massive 10-mile seawall, 17 feet high, and then raised the entire city behind it. Using hydraulic jacks and thousands of railcars filled with sand pumped from the Gulf floor, they lifted over 2,100 buildings — some while people still lived and worked inside them — raising the island up to 17 feet. That seawall still stands today, and I walk it often, thinking about the sheer determination it represents.</p>

          <p>The Strand District — now a National Historic Landmark — survived that storm and stands as testament to Galveston's golden age. These iron-front Victorian commercial buildings, built in the 1870s and 1880s, once housed cotton brokerages and shipping offices. Today they shelter galleries, restaurants, and the antique shops that make the Strand one of Texas's finest historic districts.</p>

          <p>Modern Galveston's cruise story began in earnest in 2000 when the Carnival Celebration became the first modern cruise ship to homeport here. Since then, the Port of Galveston has invested over $85 million in cruise facilities. The $156 million Pier 16 terminal opened in 2025, designed to handle Royal Caribbean's Oasis-class ships and accommodate over 1.5 million annual passengers, cementing Galveston's place as the fourth busiest cruise port in America.</p>

          <p>The Moody family has shaped much of what Galveston became after 1900. Their legacy lives on in Moody Gardens — those distinctive glass pyramids you'll see — and the Moody Foundation, which has poured resources into preserving the island's history and rebuilding its future. When I visit the gardens or walk past the restored Historic Strand, I'm walking through living history funded by those who believed this island deserved a second chapter.</p>

          <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Covered Parking:</strong> Worth the extra cost — the Texas sun is unforgiving. Exposed cars can reach dangerous interior temperatures</li>
            <li><strong>Hurricane Season:</strong> June through November — most disruptions are rare, but check forecasts and have cruise insurance</li>
            <li><strong>Cuban Sandwiches:</strong> Stop at Maceo Spice & Import in the Strand — been there since 1946</li>
            <li><strong>Shrimp Season:</strong> Gulf shrimp peaks August-December — fresh-off-the-boat seafood at Sampson & Son's on the harbor</li>
            <li><strong>Mardi Gras:</strong> Galveston's celebration (February/March) draws 350,000+ visitors — plan accordingly</li>

          <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The oldest port on the Gulf of Mexico (est. 1825) and America's fourth busiest cruise port. Once the "Wall Street of the South," Galveston survived the deadliest disaster in U.S. history (1900 hurricane, 6,000-8,000 killed) and rebuilt with a 10-mile seawall and Victorian resilience. The Strand District's National Historic Landmark status, Moody Gardens, and Gulf beaches make arriving early essential.</p>
