  "description": "I took these photos on the ferry Columbia from Haines to Bellingham in early April 2013; what a great trip! The ferry wasn't crowded and we had decent weather for a lot of the trip. I'll never forget how flipping awesome Alaska is - I do miss it every day and can't wait to get back to visit! The trip took 4 days, the food was good, and one of the best parts was that the government paid for it!!!",
