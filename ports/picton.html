        <h1>Picton: Gateway to Marlborough Sounds and South Island Serenity</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The ferry horns echo across Queen Charlotte Sound at dawn, a maritime rhythm Picton has known since the 1960s when it became the South Island terminal for the Cook Strait crossing. Standing at the town wharf where our ship docked, I watched the Interislander slide past — commuters heading to Wellington, cars lined up on the vehicle deck, oblivious to the spectacle they inhabited. Picton exists in that rare space where working harbor meets pristine wilderness.</p>

          <p>This compact town of 4,000 souls sits cradled between water and hills, the deep natural harbor that Captain Cook first charted in 1770 providing shelter for vessels large and small. The Marlborough Sounds sprawl around it — 1,500 kilometers of coastline folded into fjord-like inlets, drowned river valleys that create a labyrinth of turquoise channels and forested peninsulas. It's some of the most stunning coastal scenery in New Zealand, and Picton is your doorway.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Taking a water taxi into Queen Charlotte Sound at first light, gliding past uninhabited bays where native bush tumbles to the water's edge. The silence was absolute save for the boat's wake and the call of a tui in the canopy. We dropped anchor at a trailhead accessible only by sea, and for three hours I walked the Queen Charlotte Track with views that made me understand why sailors spent centuries seeking harbors like this. No roads. No power lines. Just water, forest, and sky.
          </div>

          <p>The town itself rewards a stroll. The Edwin Fox Maritime Museum houses the ninth-oldest surviving ship in the world — an 1853 East Indiaman that served as troop ship, convict transport, and immigrant vessel before ending its days here in 1897. Walking through its skeletal hull, I traced the journey of thousands who crossed oceans in wooden vessels no larger than a modern ferry.</p>

          <p>But Picton's real treasure lies just beyond town. The Marlborough wine region spreads 30 minutes south — home to Cloudy Bay, Brancott Estate, and dozens of cellar doors pouring what many consider the world's finest Sauvignon Blanc. The cool maritime climate and stony soils create wines with intense aromatics and crisp acidity. I tasted seven before lunch and understood why this region put New Zealand wine on the map.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Queen Charlotte Sound Cruise</h4>
          <p>Join the mail boat run that's been servicing isolated settlements since 1926. Three-hour cruise through stunning Sounds scenery, delivering mail and supplies to waterfront homes accessible only by boat. Departs 1:30 PM most days — book ahead.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Queen Charlotte Track Hiking</h4>
          <p>Water taxi drops you at scenic sections of this 71 km coastal track. Even two hours of walking delivers spectacular Sound views, native forest, and the kind of solitude that resets your soul. Arrange pickup time with your water taxi operator.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Marlborough Wine Country</h4>
          <p>Thirty minutes to world-class cellar doors. Cloudy Bay, Brancott Estate, and Villa Maria offer tastings and vineyard views. Organized tours include multiple wineries plus lunch. Book ahead — wine tours fill fast on cruise days.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Edwin Fox Maritime Museum</h4>
          <p>Walk through the world's ninth-oldest surviving ship, built in 1853. This teak-hulled vessel carried troops to the Crimean War, convicts to Australia, and immigrants to New Zealand. Ten-minute walk from cruise terminal. NZ$15 admission.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kayak the Sounds</h4>
          <p>Guided kayak tours explore sheltered bays and hidden coves. Half-day trips (3-4 hours) suit cruise schedules. No experience needed. See native birds, seals, and the Sounds from water level. Book well in advance.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Waterfront Walk</h4>
          <p>Flat, easy path along the harbor connects town with beaches and lookout points. Walk to Bob's Bay (20 min) for swimming, or continue to Tirohanga Track (45 min total) for elevated Sound views. Free and lovely.</p>
