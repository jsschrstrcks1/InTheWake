      <h3>Seafood Shack Review: Casual Fried Seafood by the Pool</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Seafood Shack is Carnival's poolside seafood counter — think boardwalk-style fried seafood at à la carte prices. It's not included in the cruise fare; items are priced individually ($8-16 range). The menu is short and focused: fried shrimp, fish and chips, lobster roll, crab cake. It's positioned as a casual upgrade from the Lido for seafood fans willing to pay a few dollars.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The lobster roll is the best item — proper chunks of lobster in a butter-toasted split-top roll with mayo and a squeeze of lemon. It's better than what you'd get at most casual shoreside restaurants. The fried shrimp basket is reliable — crispy batter, well-seasoned, served with cocktail sauce and fries. The fish and chips uses a decent beer batter and the portions are generous. The crab cake is hit or miss — sometimes it's mostly crab, sometimes it's mostly filler. Where it falls short: everything is fried, so there's no lighter option. The fries accompanying most items are standard frozen fries, not hand-cut. And the prices feel steep for what's essentially counter-service fried food — the lobster roll at $14-16 is fair, but $12 for a fried shrimp basket pushes it.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Counter service — order, pay, wait for your basket. It's quick (5-10 minutes typically) and efficient. The crew running the fryers are consistent. No table service, no frills. Lines are moderate on sea days but nothing like the Lido rush.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Poolside open-air seating — grab a deck chair or find a table near the pool. You're eating fried seafood in your swimsuit with a cold beer. The boardwalk-shack energy is exactly right for the concept. Don't expect ambiance; expect convenience and ocean air.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5.</strong> Seafood Shack fills a niche — casual fried seafood by the pool for guests who want something beyond the Lido. The lobster roll is genuinely good and worth the price. The fried shrimp basket is reliable. It loses ground for the all-fried menu, the inconsistent crab cake, the frozen fries, and the per-item pricing that adds up quickly for a family. If you get one thing, make it the lobster roll. <em>Tip:</em> pair the lobster roll with a draft beer from the pool bar — that's a $20 poolside lunch that's hard to complain about.</p>
