      "markdown": "**Discovery Princess launched in 2022 as the sixth and final Royal Class vessel—benefiting from nearly a decade of refinement.**\n\nThe Royal Class evolution tells a clear story: [Royal Princess](/ships/princess/royal-princess.html) pioneered (2013), [Regal Princess](/ships/princess/regal-princess.html) refined (2014), then [Majestic Princess](/ships/princess/majestic-princess.html), [Sky Princess](/ships/princess/sky-princess.html), and [Enchanted Princess](/ships/princess/enchanted-princess.html) continued iterating. Discovery Princess inherits everything learned.\n\nThe MedallionClass experience reaches mature expression here. The technology that felt experimental on early ships now operates seamlessly. Touchless everything. Location awareness. Personalized service enabled by data.\n\nPublic spaces reflect operational wisdom. Traffic patterns optimized. Venue placement refined. The ship flows better because Princess understood, after five attempts, exactly how passengers move.\n\nDiscovery Princess also represents Royal Class farewell. [Sun Princess](/ships/princess/sun-princess.html) and [Star Princess](/ships/princess/star-princess.html) Sphere Class point toward larger futures. Discovery Princess is the final statement of what Royal Class achieved.\n\nFor travelers seeking Royal Class at its peak: Discovery Princess delivers the concept fully realized. The benefits of being last outweigh the glamour of being first.",

      "markdown": "**Four adult siblings, four spouses, aging parents. Twelve people who needed something that worked for everyone without kids. Discovery Princess delivered.**\n\nThe challenge with adult family travel: everyone has preferences. Some wanted formal dining. Others wanted casual flexibility. Some sought activity. Others prioritized relaxation. Some drink constantly. Others never.\n\nDiscovery Princess accommodated all of it. The main dining room satisfied our formal-dining contingent. The buffet and casual venues served the flexibility seekers. The pool and fitness center worked for active siblings. The Sanctuary gave our parents peace.\n\nMedallionClass technology proved essential. We tracked each other when needed, found private time when wanted. Nobody had to coordinate constantly—the technology enabled organic gathering and dispersal.\n\nThe Piazza became our unofficial headquarters. Central location, comfortable seating, café service. When anyone wondered where the family was, the Piazza usually had some of us.\n\nDinner together happened nightly. Twelve at a long table, served simultaneously, courses paced properly. The experience we wanted—family connection over excellent food.\n\nFor adult family groups: Discovery Princess provides variety without chaos. Everyone finds their experience. Everyone connects at meals. The combination works.",

      "markdown": "**Discovery Princess entered service in 2022 as cruising recovered from shutdown. Her protocols and atmosphere reflected lessons learned.**\n\nWe'd cruised Princess for twenty years before the pandemic pause. Returning felt uncertain—would the experience survive? Would COVID protocols ruin the atmosphere? Would ships feel sterile rather than celebratory?\n\nDiscovery Princess answered our concerns positively. Yes, protocols existed. But they integrated smoothly. MedallionClass technology that seemed convenient before became essential—touchless everything reduced anxiety without reducing enjoyment.\n\nThe ship felt alive, not cautious. Entertainment returned fully. Dining operated normally. The Piazza buzzed with the atmosphere we remembered. Princess had figured out how to deliver their experience within new realities.\n\nThe crew's attitude impressed us most. After an industry shutdown that threatened livelihoods, the staff seemed genuinely thrilled to serve passengers again. The warmth felt authentic rather than trained.\n\nFor fellow cruise veterans who've hesitated: the experience survives. Discovery Princess proves that cruising adapted without abandoning what made it special. Come back—we're glad we did.",
