      <h3>Fahrenheit 555 Steakhouse Review: Carnival's Best Dressed Table</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Fahrenheit 555 is Carnival's flagship steakhouse — the room where you dress up, settle in, and order the biggest steak on the menu. Named for the temperature at which steak sears, it's the most upscale dining experience in the Carnival fleet. The cover charge runs $42–$48 per person (including appetizer, entrée, sides, and dessert), making it a genuine splurge by Carnival standards — and the one specialty dinner most repeat guests refuse to skip.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The USDA Prime cuts are the reason this restaurant exists, and they deliver. The 28-day-aged bone-in New York strip is the signature: deeply flavored, perfectly charred, and served with the kind of confidence that says the kitchen knows what it's doing. The filet mignon is tender and well-prepared, though less characterful than the strip. The lobster mac and cheese appetizer has a cult following — rich, cheesy, with generous chunks of lobster. Sides are included and substantial: the truffle fries, creamed corn, and loaded baked potato all hold up. Desserts include a warm chocolate melting cake that's become a Carnival staple. Honest note: the non-steak options (chicken, fish) exist but feel like they were added for companions who don't eat red meat — competent, not inspired. The wine list leans boldly toward reds, which suits the menu, and the sommelier can actually guide you beyond the obvious choices.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>This is where Fahrenheit 555 earns its premium positioning. Servers are among Carnival's best — polished, knowledgeable, and clearly enjoying working in the ship's nicest room. Steak temperatures are explained and honored. Wine pours are proper. Pacing feels intentional, letting you enjoy a 2-hour dinner without feeling hurried. It's noticeably more refined than the Main Dining Room, and the difference justifies the cover charge as much as the food does.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Dark wood, mood lighting, white tablecloths, leather banquettes — Fahrenheit 555 is the most sophisticated room on any Carnival ship. The design varies slightly by vessel, but the intent is consistent: this is supposed to feel like a proper land-based steakhouse. It succeeds. The noise level is lower than most onboard restaurants, making it a genuine date-night option. On newer ships (Mardi Gras, Celebration), the design is sleeker and more contemporary.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Fahrenheit 555 is Carnival's best restaurant, full stop — the steaks are excellent, the service is a cut above, and the atmosphere makes you forget you're on a cruise ship. It doesn't reach a perfect score because the non-steak options are underwhelming and the cover charge puts it at a price point where it competes with genuinely great steakhouses on land. But at sea, this is as good as it gets on Carnival. <em>Tip:</em> book for Night 2 or 3 — the kitchen is warmed up and the dining room isn't fighting embarkation-day chaos.</p>
