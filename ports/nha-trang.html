        <h1>Nha Trang: Where Ancient Towers Watch Over Turquoise Paradise</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Nha Trang doesn't announce itself — it unfolds. As our ship approaches this crescent bay, I watch the coastline reveal itself in layers: emerald mountains rising behind the city, a six-kilometer sweep of white sand beach, turquoise water so clear I can see shadows of boats on the seafloor, and in the distance, a cable car suspended impossibly high above the waves, carrying passengers to an island amusement park. This is Vietnam's premier beach resort, a place where millennium-old Cham towers stand sentinel over a bay that UNESCO recognized as one of the world's most beautiful.</p>

          <p>The drive from Cam Ranh Port takes just over an hour, but it's worth every minute. Rice paddies flash past the windows, water buffalo grazing in emerald fields, mountains draped in jungle green. Nha Trang itself is pure beach-city energy — palm-lined boulevards, Russian signage alongside Vietnamese (Russian tourists flock here for the warmth), seafood restaurants spilling onto sidewalks, and everywhere that crystalline water beckoning.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at Po Nagar Cham Towers, looking down at the Cai River where it meets the sea. These brick temples have weathered twelve centuries — built in 781 AD by the Hindu Kingdom of Champa, bombed by American planes in the Vietnam War, restored by people who refused to let history disappear. A Vietnamese grandmother was lighting incense at the altar, her grandson beside her. The same ritual performed for over a thousand years, unbroken despite everything. Some threads hold.
          </div>

          <p>If you've only got one day, divide it between past and present: morning at the ancient Cham towers where you can still see Sanskrit inscriptions carved into brick, afternoon at Hon Mun Marine Protected Area where the underwater world explodes in color, and if time allows, that spectacular cable car ride over the bay to Vinpearl Island. The cable car alone — two miles suspended over water — is worth the trip. The view from above makes you understand why sailors have treasured this bay for centuries.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Po Nagar Cham Towers</h4>
          <p>Ancient Hindu temple complex dating to 781 AD — four brick towers on a hilltop overlooking the Cai River. Intricate Sanskrit inscriptions, centuries-old architecture, active worship site for Buddhist and Hindu devotees. 10 minutes north of downtown. Entry 22,000 VND (~$1). Respectful dress required (shoulders/knees covered; sarongs provided). Morning visit recommended for cooler temperatures and better light. 1-2 hours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Vinpearl Island via Cable Car</h4>
          <p>Spectacular 2-mile (3.3 km) cable car ride over Nha Trang Bay to Hon Tre Island — one of the world's longest over-water cable cars. Vinpearl Land amusement park, water park, aquarium, beach. Cable car alone worth the trip for breathtaking views. Combined ticket ~880,000 VND ($35) includes all-day park access. Allow half-day minimum. Cable car departs from Phu Quy harbor.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hon Mun Marine Protected Area</h4>
          <p>Premier snorkeling and diving destination — 340+ coral species, sea turtles, tropical fish, crystal-clear waters. Protected marine reserve since 2001. Half-day island hopping tours (4-6 hours) include snorkeling equipment, lunch, multiple reef sites. Tours from ~500,000-700,000 VND ($20-28). Underwater visibility excellent. Marine life spectacular. Book through ship excursions or local operators at harbor.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Long Son Pagoda</h4>

          <p>French Gothic architecture built 1928-1933 — stone construction, stained glass windows, hillside location overlooking city. Mass held daily. Free entry outside service times. Peaceful respite from beach crowds. 30-minute visit adds cultural perspective. 5 minutes from beach.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ba Ho Waterfall</h4>
          <p>Three-tiered waterfall 45 minutes north of Nha Trang — swimmable natural pools, jungle hiking, rice paddy scenery. Each tier requires climbing (some slippery rocks). Lower falls easiest access. Bring water shoes and swimwear. Entry ~30,000 VND ($1.25). Half-day excursion. Best during dry season (wet season can be dangerous). Rewarding nature escape.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Ship excursions or local tour operators handle transfers from Cam Ranh Port and major sights. Most practical for limited time.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Metered taxis available; use reputable companies (Mai Linh, Vinasun). Downtown to Po Nagar ~50,000 VND ($2). Agree on meter usage before departure.</li>
            <li><strong>Bicycle Rickshaws:</strong> Cyclo rides ~100,000-125,000 VND ($4-5) per hour. Negotiate price firmly before boarding. Pleasant for beach boulevard touring.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Tran Phu Beach promenade walkable and scenic. City compact for beachfront areas. Sidewalks variable quality. Watch for motorbikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Motorbike Rental:</strong> Available but not recommended for cruise visitors — traffic chaotic, unfamiliar roads, liability concerns. Stick with tours/taxis.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bún chả cá:</strong> Nha Trang's signature dish — fish cake noodle soup with fresh herbs, broth made from mackerel. Every local has a favorite vendor. Breakfast staple.</li>
            <li><strong>Nem nướng Ninh Hòa:</strong> Grilled pork spring rolls from nearby Ninh Hòa district — grilled pork, fresh herbs, rice paper, sweet dipping sauce. Street food perfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Lobster:</strong> Nha Trang farms lobster offshore — grilled, steamed, or in hot pots. Beachfront restaurants specialize. Price by weight; bargaining expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Seafood:</strong> Prawns, squid, crab, fish grilled tableside at beach restaurants. Morning market offers freshest catch. Point and order — universal language.</li>
            <li><strong>Bánh căn:</strong> Tiny rice flour pancakes cooked in clay molds — topped with quail egg, shrimp, or pork. Addictive street snack.</li>
            <li><strong>Bia Hơi:</strong> Fresh draft beer brewed daily — light lager served ice-cold. Cheap (~10,000 VND / 40¢ per glass) and refreshing. Social lubricant.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Carry small denomination Vietnamese Dong — vendors at temples, street food, markets prefer exact change. ATMs dispense large bills; break them at convenience stores.</li>
            <li>Bargaining is standard at markets, with cyclo drivers, at beach vendors. Start at 50-60% of asking price. Smile and be good-natured.</li>
            <li>Russian signage everywhere — Nha Trang is hugely popular with Russian tourists. Don't be surprised by Cyrillic menus at restaurants.</li>
            <li>Reef-safe sunscreen for Hon Mun Marine Protected Area — chemical sunscreens damage coral. Bring your own or buy at dive shops.</li>
            <li>Temple dress codes enforced — shoulders and knees covered at Po Nagar and Long Son Pagoda. Sarongs/scarves provided but bring your own for comfort.</li>
            <li>Island hopping tours can feel rushed — if you love snorkeling, book a dedicated dive/snorkel tour focusing on Hon Mun rather than multi-stop party boats.</li>
            <li>Cable car to Vinpearl can have long waits during Vietnamese holidays (Lunar New Year, summer break). Weekday mornings quietest.</li>
            <li>Beaches near glamorous resorts (Tran Phu Beach) are public and free — you don't need resort access to enjoy the sand and water.</li>
            <li>Water safety: Stick to marked swimming areas. Currents can be strong at certain beaches (Hon Chong). Lifeguards limited outside major resorts.</li>
          </ul>
