        <h1>Hiroshima: Where Memory Becomes Hope</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Hiroshima teaches you something about resilience that no other place on earth can. This city — reduced to ash and shadow on an August morning in 1945 — chose not to become a monument to destruction, but a living testament to peace. The skeletal dome stands exactly where it fell, iron ribs twisted against the sky, but around it the city has rebuilt itself into something vibrant, green, and determinedly hopeful. Children play in the Peace Park. Couples photograph cherry blossoms. Streetcars glide past modern buildings where once there was nothing but rubble. Hiroshima didn't forget. It transformed.</p>

          <p>The Peace Memorial Museum opens at 8:30 AM, and I learned to arrive when the doors unlock. Not to beat the crowds — though that helps — but because some experiences demand quiet. The museum doesn't sensationalize. It doesn't need to. A child's tricycle, melted glass, shadows burned into stone. The exhibits speak in whispers that echo like thunder. You move through the galleries slowly, feeling the weight of what happened here, and then you emerge into daylight where the Atomic Bomb Dome stands reflected in still water. The message is clear: never again.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing before the Memorial Cenotaph in Peace Park, through which you can see the Flame of Peace and the Dome beyond, perfectly aligned. The flame burns continuously and will until every nuclear weapon on earth is destroyed. An elderly woman laid origami cranes at the cenotaph — hundreds of them strung together, bright paper birds against gray stone. She bowed deeply, twice, and walked away. I don't know her story, but I know Hiroshima's: they chose forgiveness over bitterness, hope over despair. That takes a strength I can barely comprehend.
          </div>

          <p>Then there's Miyajima. The island sits just offshore, a 45-minute ferry ride from Peace Park via the World Heritage Sea Route, and it offers a completely different face of Japan — ancient, serene, mystical. Itsukushima Shrine seems to float on the water at high tide, its vermilion corridors and platforms built on pilings over the sea. The famous torii gate rises from the shallows, framing the sacred mountain beyond. Timing matters here. At low tide the gate stands in mud and you can walk beneath it. At high tide it appears to float, glowing against the water. I've seen both, and both are magic.</p>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Most ships dock at Ujina Foreign Trade Wharf (280m berth, 3km from city center); larger ships use Itsukaichi Wharf (430m berth)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> Ujina Wharf to Peace Memorial Park ~3 km (shuttle bus or taxi 10-15 min); Itsukaichi Wharf farther (shuttle provided)</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Japanese Yen (¥ / JPY); credit cards accepted widely but cash preferred at markets and smaller shops</li>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Peace Memorial Park & Museum</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage site dedicated to the victims of the atomic bombing and the pursuit of world peace. Atomic Bomb Dome (Genbaku Dome) — skeletal ruins left standing exactly as they fell. Peace Memorial Museum (opens 8:30 AM — arrive early) presents unflinching history with dignity. Memorial Cenotaph, Children's Peace Monument (Sadako Sasaki's origami cranes), Flame of Peace. Deeply moving, essential experience. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Admission ¥200 (~$1.50). Main areas wheelchair accessible.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Miyajima Island (Itsukushima Shrine)</h4>
          <p>Japan's most iconic view — vermilion torii gate rising from the Seto Inland Sea. Itsukushima Shrine (UNESCO World Heritage) built on boardwalks over water; shrine buildings float at high tide. Time your visit with tide tables — gate appears to float at high tide, accessible on foot at low tide. Friendly wild deer roam the island. Reach via World Heritage Sea Route ferry from Peace Park (45 min, ¥4,000 round-trip) or train to Miyajimaguchi then local ferry (10 min). Full day recommended for both Peace Park and Miyajima. Shrine admission ¥300 (~$2).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Miyajima Night Light-Up & Kayak Tours</h4>
          <p>Evening cruises around Miyajima offer illuminated shrine and torii gate reflected on dark water — magical experience. Kayak tours paddle beneath the torii gate at sunset (advance booking required, ~¥8,000 / $55 per person). If your ship overnights in Hiroshima, the night view is unforgettable. The shrine glows gold against black water, and the island goes quiet as day-trippers depart.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hiroshima Castle</h4>
          <p>Reconstructed 1950s concrete replica of the 1599 original (destroyed in bombing). Five-story main keep houses history museum with samurai armor, feudal exhibits. Pleasant moat and grounds. Not essential if time is limited, but offers contrast to Peace Park — a glimpse of pre-war Hiroshima. 15-minute walk from Peace Park. Admission ¥370 (~$2.50). Allow 1 hour.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Shukkeien Garden</h4>
          <p>Traditional Japanese landscape garden (1620) with miniature valleys, mountains, and forests surrounding a central pond. Destroyed in 1945, painstakingly reconstructed. Tranquil counterpoint to the intensity of Peace Park. Tea house serves matcha. 15 minutes from Peace Park by streetcar. Admission ¥260 (~$1.80). Allow 1 hour. Peaceful restorative experience.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Okonomimura (Okonomiyaki Village)</h4>
          <p>Four-story building packed with 24 okonomiyaki restaurants — Hiroshima's culinary soul in concentrated form. Watch chefs build layered Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki on griddles (cabbage, noodles, pork, egg, toppings). Casual, delicious, authentic. Downtown location. Budget ¥1,000-1,500 (~$7-10) per person. Lunch or dinner. Pure Hiroshima experience.</p>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Hiroshima Oysters:</strong> City is famous for plump, sweet oysters. Served grilled, fried, raw, or in hot pot. Best October-March (peak season). Kakiya restaurant near Peace Park specializes.</li>
            <li><strong>Momiji Manju:</strong> Maple leaf-shaped cakes filled with red bean paste, custard, chocolate, or cheese. Miyajima specialty. Perfect souvenir. Try freshly made or deep-fried versions.</li>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrive at Peace Memorial Museum when it opens (8:30 AM) for quieter, more contemplative experience before tour groups arrive.</li>
            <li>Check Miyajima tide times before visiting — torii gate "floats" at high tide, accessible on foot at low tide. Both views are beautiful but very different. Tide tables posted at ferry terminals.</li>
            <li>You CAN do Peace Park and Miyajima in one full day if you start early. Peace Park 8:30 AM-noon, ferry to Miyajima for afternoon. World Heritage Sea Route connects both UNESCO sites.</li>
            <li>Download Google Translate app with Japanese offline language pack — camera translation feature reads signs and menus in real-time.</li>
            <li>Wheelchair users: Peace Park main areas are accessible (some gravel paths challenging). Miyajima ferry terminal offers free wheelchair loans. Itsukushima Shrine boardwalks are flat but narrow.</li>
            <li>Respect the solemnity of Peace Park — this is hallowed ground. Speak quietly, silence phone, dress modestly. Many visitors are survivors, descendants, or mourners.</li>
            <li>Cash is king in Japan — many restaurants, temples, and shops don't accept cards. ATMs at 7-Eleven convenience stores accept foreign cards.</li>
            <li>Miyajima deer are wild (not petting zoo animals). They're usually gentle but can be aggressive if they smell food. Don't feed them, keep snacks in bags.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Most ships dock at Ujina Foreign Trade Wharf (3 km from Peace Park). Larger ships use Itsukaichi Wharf. Shuttles or taxis connect to city center (10-15 min).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I visit Peace Park and Miyajima in one day?</strong><br/>A: Yes, if you start early. Peace Park 8:30 AM-noon, then World Heritage Sea Route ferry to Miyajima (45 min) for the afternoon. Covers both UNESCO sites. Full-day excursions often combine both.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is the Peace Memorial Museum difficult emotionally?</strong><br/>A: Yes. It's unflinching but presented with dignity and respect. Allow yourself to feel what you feel. Benches and rest areas available. The experience is powerful, important, and ultimately hopeful.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: When is the best time to see the floating torii gate?</strong><br/>A: Check tide tables (posted at ferry terminals, online, or ask at port). High tide = gate appears to float. Low tide = you can walk beneath it. Both views are stunning. High tide is more photogenic; low tide is more interactive.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br/>A: Japanese Yen (¥ / JPY). Credit cards accepted at major sites but cash preferred. ATMs at 7-Eleven accept foreign cards. Bring cash for streetcars, small restaurants, temples.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Do I need to speak Japanese?</strong><br/>A: Major tourist sites have English signage and some English-speaking staff. Google Translate camera feature is invaluable for menus and signs. Learn basic phrases (thank you = arigatou gozaimasu). Hiroshima is accustomed to international visitors.</p>
