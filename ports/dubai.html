    <article class="card"><h1>Dubai: Where Tomorrow's Skyline Meets Ancient Arabian Soul</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The first time I saw the Burj Khalifa from the ship's deck, I understood why Dubai has become the jewel of Middle Eastern cruising. Our vessel looked almost humble against the world's tallest building piercing the morning sky — a gleaming needle of glass and steel rising over 800 meters into the desert air. As we approached Mina Rashid, traditional wooden dhows bobbed alongside our modern cruise ship, a perfect metaphor for a city that somehow makes the ancient and futuristic coexist.</p>

        <p>Dubai confounded every expectation I had. Yes, it's opulent — absurdly, gleefully opulent — but it's also genuinely welcoming, surprisingly affordable if you know where to look, and far more culturally rich than the "shopping mall in the desert" stereotype suggests. The call to prayer echoing between skyscrapers, the scent of oud and cardamom in the souks, the warmth of Emirati hospitality — these aren't contradictions to Dubai's modernity; they're essential to understanding it.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at the top of the Burj Khalifa at sunset, watching the city transform from gold to pink to deep purple, then seeing the lights flicker on across the endless expanse below. For a few minutes, I understood why people build impossible things — sometimes you need to stand above the clouds to remember how beautiful the earth is. The ticket wasn't cheap, but some views are worth whatever they cost.
        </div>

        <p>What surprised me most was how walkable parts of Dubai can be — just not in the way Western cities are walkable. The Dubai Mall alone kept us occupied for hours, and not just shopping. We watched the Dubai Fountain show from multiple angles (free!), wandered through the massive aquarium, and escaped the afternoon heat in air-conditioned splendor. When we finally ventured outside, the water taxi (abra) across Dubai Creek cost roughly one dollar and felt like time travel — from gleaming towers to weathered wooden boats in minutes.</p>

          <li><strong>Distance to Downtown:</strong> 15 minutes to Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa by taxi; 30 minutes to Dubai Marina</li>
          <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock directly at the pier</li>
          <li><strong>Currency:</strong> UAE Dirham (AED); USD widely accepted; credit cards work everywhere</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> Arabic official; English universally spoken</li>
          <li><strong>Time Zone:</strong> GST (UTC+4) — no daylight saving time</li>

      <!-- Getting Around -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around Dubai</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Dubai is spread out but well-connected.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Metro</h4>
        <p>The Red Line runs from near the port (Al Ghubaiba station, 10-minute taxi) through Downtown Dubai (Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall station) to Dubai Marina. Clean, fast, air-conditioned, and cheap — under $2 per ride. Get a Nol card at any station.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taxis</h4>
        <p>Metered, air-conditioned, and honest. Flag fall is about $3, and a ride to Burj Khalifa runs $10-15. The RTA taxi app works well. Women traveling alone can request pink-roofed female-driver taxis.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Abra (Water Taxi)</h4>
        <p>Traditional wooden boats crossing Dubai Creek — just 1 AED (about $0.27). The most atmospheric way to travel between Bur Dubai and Deira. Runs constantly; no schedule needed.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Walking</h4>
        <p>Possible within districts (Dubai Mall area, Old Dubai souks) but not between them. Summer heat makes outdoor walking dangerous — stick to air-conditioned connections.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Top Experiences -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What I'd do with limited time.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Burj Khalifa</h4>
        <p>The world's tallest building (828m/2,717ft) is genuinely awe-inspiring. Book "At the Top" tickets online in advance — the 124th/125th floor observation deck offers incredible views. Sunset timing costs more but is worth it. Budget: $40-60 per person depending on timing.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Fountain</h4>
        <p>The world's largest choreographed fountain performs every 30 minutes from 6pm-11pm (plus 1pm and 1:30pm shows). Completely free. Watch from the Dubai Mall waterfront terrace or take an abra ride on the Burj Lake ($5) for an up-close experience.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Gold Souk</h4>
        <p>In Deira, across Dubai Creek. Hundreds of shops displaying more gold than you've ever seen in one place. Prices are based on daily gold rates plus craftsmanship — bargaining expected. Even if you're not buying, it's a spectacle.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Spice Souk</h4>
        <p>Adjacent to the Gold Souk, this aromatic market sells saffron, frankincense, dried fruits, and traditional Arabian goods. Much more affordable than gold, and the vendors love sharing their knowledge.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Desert Safari</h4>
        <p>Half-day excursions include dune bashing (thrilling 4x4 driving over sand dunes), camel rides, henna painting, and a BBQ dinner with belly dancing. Book through the ship or vetted operators. Budget: $60-100 per person.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Mall</h4>
        <p>One of the world's largest malls — 1,200+ stores, an aquarium, ice rink, and endless dining. Don't dismiss it as "just shopping" — it's a destination. The aquarium viewing panel (free) and underwater zoo (paid) impress even non-shoppers.</p>

        <h3>Practical Tips</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Dubai is cosmopolitan, but modest dress is appreciated. Cover shoulders and knees in malls and public areas. Swimwear only at pools and beaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Ramadan:</strong> If visiting during Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking in public during daylight hours is prohibited. Restaurants have screened areas for non-Muslims.</li>
          <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Available only in licensed venues (hotels, some restaurants). Don't drink in public or appear intoxicated.</li>
          <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Ask before photographing people, especially Emirati women. Avoid photographing government buildings and military installations.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> Service charges are often included, but small tips (10-15%) are appreciated.</li>
          <li><strong>Friday:</strong> The Islamic holy day. Some businesses close Friday morning; malls open around noon.</li>
