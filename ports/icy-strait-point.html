    <!-- First-Person Logbook Entry -->
    <section id="logbook" class="card logbook-entry">
      <h2>Captain's Logbook</h2>

      <p>The ship docked literally in wilderness — no tourist traps, no jewelry stores, no fake frontier facades. The pier is the restored Hoonah Packing Company cannery, built in 1912 and once Alaska's most productive salmon processing plant. In 1917, it packed a record-breaking 152,505 cases of salmon. The air smelled of salt, spruce, and alder smoke from beach fires. Everything here — every shop, every tour, every restaurant — is owned by the Huna Tlingit through their Huna Totem Corporation. All profits go directly to the community of Hoonah. This isn't corporate cruise tourism; it's Indigenous economic self-determination, and you feel the difference immediately.</p>

      <p>We did whale watching first thing — a small boat departed directly from the dock, and within 20 minutes we were surrounded by humpbacks at Point Adolphus. One breaching male launched completely clear of the water seven times in a row while our Tlingit guide quietly said "he's showing off for you — that's a gift." The sound of 40 tons hitting the water is thunderous and humbling. I also spotted Steller sea lions on rocky haul-outs, tufted puffins rafting like little footballs on the swells, and Dall's porpoises riding our bow wave. Our guide said Point Adolphus is better than Juneau for whale watching because the nutrient-rich waters where Icy Strait meets the ocean create a feeding ground that draws humpbacks from across Southeast Alaska.</p>

      <p>Then came the ZipRider — and I need to be honest here. I'm terrified of heights, but my wife insisted. The numbers: 5,330 feet long, 1,300-foot vertical drop, speeds up to 65 mph. You sit in a harness chair at the top of a mountain, look down at rainforest and Port Frederick spread below you, and then you just... fall. The 90-second ride is simultaneously the most terrifying and exhilarating thing I've ever done. I screamed the entire way down, laughed when I landed, and immediately wanted to do it again. The view of glacial peaks, forested islands, and distant open ocean is absolutely worth the fear.</p>

      <p>Lunch was fresh Dungeness crab cracked tableside at the Crab Station ($35-45 for a generous portion) and reindeer sausage grilled over alder wood ($12). We sat on the beach eating while ravens tried to steal fries from tourists who weren't paying attention. The setting was genuinely surreal — a beautifully restored historic cannery, towering forested mountains, bald eagles circling overhead, and authentic Alaska hospitality. However, unlike other cruise ports, there's no franchise restaurants or chain stores. Everything is local, authentic, and Tlingit-owned.</p>

      <p>The afternoon forest trail walk took us on boardwalks through old-growth Sitka spruce and western hemlock. Interpretive signs in both Tlingit and English explained the traditional uses of plants — which bark makes rope, which berries are edible, which roots cure ailments. Bear scat was everywhere (fresh, too), but we made noise on the trails as instructed and saw only the back end of one brown bear disappearing into the brush. Our guide explained that the Huna Tlingit were displaced from Glacier Bay by advancing glaciers in the 1750s and established the permanent village of Hoonah; this land has been their home for over 10,000 years.</p>

      <p>I visited the cultural center where Tlingit elders demonstrated traditional weaving and carving. A master carver was working on a canoe — the first ocean-going canoe built in Hoonah in over 100 years. He let me touch the adze marks and explained that the cedar came from a tree struck by lightning, which the Tlingit consider spiritually significant. These weren't performances for tourists; these were artisans doing their work and allowing visitors to watch.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> That humpback breaching over and over, twisting mid-air so we saw its white belly and barnacles, while our Tlingit guide quietly said "he's showing off for you — that's a gift." I finally understood what it means for Indigenous people to own their own tourism.
      </div>

      <p>The pros: this is the most authentic Alaska experience you'll get on a megaship cruise — genuine wilderness, exceptional wildlife, Indigenous-owned and operated, and zero cruise-ship kitsch. All profits stay in the local community.</p>

      <p>The cons: only one or two ships visit per day due to limited pier capacity, so excursions book up fast. The port is small — you can see everything in 4-5 hours — though that's actually refreshing after the chaos of larger ports. Weather can turn quickly, so be prepared for rain even on sunny mornings.</p>

      <p>Practical tips: Book whale watching and ZipRider as early as possible — they sell out weeks before sailing. Do the zipline first thing or last to avoid midday lines. Wear layers and bring rain gear. The free shuttle to Hoonah village is worth the trip if you want to see a real working Alaska Native community rather than a tourist zone.</p>

    <!-- Cruise Port Section -->
    <section id="cruise_port" class="card">
      <h2>Cruise Port</h2>
      <p>Icy Strait Point is unique among Alaska cruise ports: it's 100% owned by the Huna Totem Corporation, the village corporation of the Huna Tlingit people. Unlike Juneau or Ketchikan where cruise traffic supports a mix of local and outside businesses, every dollar spent here directly benefits the Indigenous community of Hoonah. The port opened in 2004 after the community restored the historic Hoonah Packing Company cannery, transforming a derelict salmon processing plant into Alaska's most authentic cruise destination.</p>
      <p>The multi-million dollar dock expansion in 2016 (with Norwegian adding a second pier in 2020) allows ships to dock directly without tendering. You step off the gangway onto the restored cannery pier — shops, restaurants, the cultural center, and tour departures are all steps away. There's no shuttle required to reach attractions unless you want to visit Hoonah village, which is about 1 mile away with complimentary shuttle service. The port sits 22 miles from Glacier Bay National Park, making it a natural pairing on Alaska itineraries.</p>
      <p>Capacity is deliberately limited to maintain the wilderness atmosphere — typically only one or two ships visit per day. This means smaller crowds but also means excursions book up faster than at high-volume ports. The port is wheelchair accessible with paved paths connecting the main attractions, though forest trails and some tour vehicles may have limited accessibility. Guest services at the cannery can arrange accommodations for mobility-impaired visitors.</p>

    <!-- Getting Around Section -->
    <section id="getting_around" class="card">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Icy Strait Point is wonderfully compact — almost everything you'd want to do is within walking distance of the pier.

        <li><strong>Forest Trails:</strong> Boardwalk trails into old-growth forest depart from the cannery area. Terrain is mostly flat with some uneven surfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shuttle Service</h4>

      <h2>Top Excursions</h2>
      <p>Icy Strait Point excursions focus on what makes this place unique: exceptional wildlife, authentic Indigenous culture, and genuine Alaska wilderness. All tours are operated by the Huna Totem Corporation, ensuring quality and that profits benefit the local community.</p>

      <h3>Whale Watching</h3>
      <p>Point Adolphus whale watching ($150-200, 2.5-3 hours) is consistently rated among Alaska's best. Many locals consider it superior to Juneau because the nutrient-rich waters where Icy Strait meets the open ocean create an exceptional feeding ground for humpbacks. Expect to see multiple humpbacks, often breaching and bubble-net feeding, plus orcas, Dall's porpoises, seals, sea otters, and abundant seabirds. Boats are small (12-20 passengers) with Tlingit guides who share both natural history and cultural perspectives. Book early through your cruise line — this excursion sells out weeks in advance.</p>

      <h3>ZipRider World's Longest Zipline</h3>
      <p>The ZipRider ($150-180) is 5,330 feet long with a 1,300-foot vertical drop — certified as the world's longest zipline. Riders reach speeds up to 65 mph during the approximately 90-second descent over rainforest and Port Frederick. Six parallel cables allow groups to ride together. Weight limits: 90-275 lbs. Not recommended for those with heart conditions, back problems, or fear of heights (though I survived!). Book ahead and bring a GoPro — the views are spectacular.</p>

      <h3>Brown Bear Viewing</h3>
      <p>Remote bear viewing excursions ($500-700, 4-5 hours) travel by float plane or boat to locations where Alaska brown bears fish for salmon. Small groups (6-8 people) observe from safe distances while expert guides explain bear behavior. This is one of the few places where cruise passengers can see wild brown bears in their natural habitat. Best during salmon runs (July-September). Not wheelchair accessible due to remote terrain.</p>

      <h3>Tlingit Cultural Experiences</h3>
      <p>The Huna Heritage Cultural Center ($25-40 for guided tours) offers authentic encounters with Tlingit culture — master carvers at work, traditional weaving demonstrations, storytelling by elders, and exhibits on Huna history. This isn't a performance; it's a window into living culture. The guided cannery museum tour ($15-25) explains the salmon processing history and the community's journey from displacement to economic self-determination. Fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

      <h3>Kayaking</h3>
      <p>Guided kayaking tours ($120-180, 2-3 hours) paddle the protected waters of Port Frederick surrounded by old-growth forest. Calm conditions make this suitable for beginners. Wildlife sightings (eagles, seals, sea otters) are common. Kayaks accommodate most body sizes; tandem options available for those wanting a partner. Dress in layers — you will get splashed.</p>

      <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
      <p>Whale watching and ZipRider sell out quickly — book as early as possible through your cruise line when booking opens. Ship excursion prices are typically 10-15% higher than booking direct, but include guaranteed return to ship. For independent exploration, the cannery complex, beach walks, and forest trails are free and don't require booking. Compare ship excursion costs with Huna Totem's direct offerings at icystraitpoint.com — you may save money booking ahead independently, but ship tours guarantee return even if schedules run late.</p>

      <h2>Depth Soundings</h2>
      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Everything you need to know before stepping ashore.</p>

      <h3>Weather & What to Bring</h3>
      <p>Southeast Alaska weather is unpredictable — expect temperatures between 50-65°F (10-18°C) in summer with frequent rain. Pack waterproof layers, sturdy walking shoes, and bring rain gear even on sunny mornings. Afternoons often turn misty. Bring binoculars for whale watching and wildlife spotting.</p>

      <h4>Essential Gear</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rain jacket:</strong> Waterproof and windproof is essential — not just water-resistant.</li>
        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Temperatures can change 15 degrees in an hour. Fleece or wool mid-layers work best.</li>
        <li><strong>Sturdy shoes:</strong> Wet boardwalks and forest trails can be slippery. Leave the sandals on the ship.</li>
        <li><strong>Binoculars:</strong> Essential for whale watching and wildlife. Ships sometimes rent them if you don't have your own.</li>
        <li><strong>Bear spray:</strong> Provided for forest hikes — take it seriously, this is bear country.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Useful Details</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> US Dollars. ATMs available at the cannery. All major credit cards accepted.</li>
        <li><strong>WiFi/Cell:</strong> Limited cell service. Free WiFi at the Landing Zone Restaurant & Bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Main cannery complex is wheelchair accessible. Some forest trails have boardwalks. Contact guest services for accessible tour options.</li>
        <li><strong>Wildlife Safety:</strong> Bears are real — make noise on trails, travel in groups, and follow guide instructions. Never approach or feed wildlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Dial 911. Medical facilities are limited; serious emergencies may require evacuation to Juneau.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Costs & Tipping</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meals:</strong> Dungeness crab $35-45, reindeer sausage $10-15, halibut tacos $18-22.</li>
        <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> 15-20% at restaurants, $10-20 per person for half-day tours, $20-30 for full-day excursions.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping:</strong> Authentic Tlingit art ($50-500+), locally made goods. All shops are Indigenous-owned.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrive early for the ZipRider (lines build by late morning) or go last — the afternoon light makes for better views. And yes, you can do whale watching and ZipRider in the same day if you book the early whale tour.</p>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Icy Strait Point worth it on an Alaska cruise?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely — Icy Strait Point offers the most authentic Alaska experience on any megaship itinerary. Unlike commercial tourist ports, this is 100% Huna Tlingit-owned with all profits benefiting the local Indigenous community. You get genuine wilderness, world-class wildlife, and authentic culture without the cruise-ship kitsch found at larger ports.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What is the best excursion at Icy Strait Point?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Whale watching is consistently rated the best excursion — locals consider Point Adolphus superior to Juneau for humpback sightings. The ZipRider (world's longest zipline at 5,330 feet) is incredibly popular for thrill-seekers. Both book up quickly, so reserve early through your cruise line.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Can you walk from the cruise dock?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — everything is steps from the pier. The historic cannery, shops, restaurants, cultural center, and tour departures are all at the dock. A free shuttle runs to Hoonah village (1 mile) if you want to explore the town, but most visitors stay at the port where all attractions are walkable.</p>

        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How long is the ZipRider?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The ZipRider is 5,330 feet long with a 1,300-foot vertical drop — certified as the world's longest zipline. Riders reach speeds up to 65 mph during the approximately 90-second ride. Six parallel cables allow groups to ride together. Weight limits: 90-275 lbs.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Excellent for families! Whale watching is suitable for all ages, the beach is perfect for tide-pooling, forest trails are easy, and the cultural center engages kids with hands-on activities. ZipRider has a minimum weight (90 lbs) so younger children can't ride, but there's plenty else to do. The compact port means you won't lose track of anyone.</p>
