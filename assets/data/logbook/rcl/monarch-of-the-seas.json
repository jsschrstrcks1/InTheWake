      "markdown": "**Monarch of the Seas launched in November 1991 as the second Sovereign-class ship.**\n\nWhere [Sovereign](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) focused on short Bahamas cruises and [Majesty](/ships/rcl/majesty-of-the-seas.html) followed the same pattern, Monarch carved a different path: longer Caribbean itineraries and seasonal Bermuda cruises from Northeast ports.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Entered service: November 16, 1991\n- Gross tonnage: 73,937 GT\n- Capacity: 2,354 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Length: 880 feet\n- Built by: Chantiers de l'Atlantique, France\n- Primary routes: Bermuda (seasonal from New York/Baltimore), Caribbean (from Port Canaveral and Los Angeles)\n- Notable features: Five-story atrium, two-deck dining room, extensive deck space\n- Retired: 2013 (transferred to Pullmantur Cruises, scrapped 2020)\n\n**What made Monarch different:**\n\nMonarch became Royal Caribbean's Bermuda specialist. Summer seasons sailing from New York (Cape Liberty, Bayonne) and Baltimore to Kings Wharf, Bermuda. Seven-night itineraries that gave passengers multiple days docked in Bermuda—different from the port-hopping Caribbean model.\n\nBermuda passengers developed fierce loyalty to Monarch. The ship, the route, the crew—it became a ritual for East Coast families who wanted warm weather without flying to Florida.\n\nWinter seasons, Monarch repositioned to Port Canaveral for Caribbean cruises. Later in her career, she sailed from Los Angeles to the Mexican Riviera—proving Sovereign-class ships could handle diverse deployments."

      "markdown": "**Common praise from Monarch passengers (documented in reviews and forums):**\n\n\"Sailed Monarch to Bermuda eight times. Same ship, same route, never got old.\"\n\n\"She wasn't flashy like [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), but she was *ours*. Crew remembered us year after year.\"\n\n\"Bermuda from New York meant no flights. Drive to Bayonne, board, wake up at sea. Perfect.\"\n\n\"The deck space was incredible. Never felt crowded, even on sold-out sailings.\"\n\n\"When they announced Monarch was leaving in 2013, the Bermuda Facebook groups mourned for weeks.\"\n\n**Documented achievements:**\n- Sailed Bermuda seasonally for over 15 years, introducing hundreds of thousands of passengers to the island\n- Known for exceptional crew retention—many crew members stayed on Monarch for her entire Royal Caribbean career\n- Maintained high satisfaction scores despite being an older ship competing against newer fleet additions\n- Successfully transitioned between East Coast (Bermuda), Florida (Caribbean), and West Coast (Mexican Riviera) deployments\n\n**The sale and final years:**\n\nIn 2013, Royal Caribbean transferred Monarch to Pullmantur Cruises (their Spanish-market subsidiary). She was renamed Monarch (keeping the name), refurbished for European and Caribbean markets, and sailed primarily Spanish-speaking itineraries.\n\nPullmantur ceased operations in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monarch was laid up, eventually scrapped in Alang, India in 2020.\n\n**What passengers remember:**\n\nMonarch wasn't revolutionary. She didn't pioneer new features or break size records. But she did something harder: she built loyalty. Passengers sailed her repeatedly, not because she was the newest or best, but because she was *reliable*—same quality, same service, year after year.\n\nSee [Sovereign of the Seas](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) and [Majesty of the Seas](/ships/rcl/majesty-of-the-seas.html) for her sister ships."
