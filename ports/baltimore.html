        <h1>Baltimore: Charm City's Gateway to the Caribbean</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>I've sailed from Baltimore several times, and each departure feels like setting forth from the very heart of American maritime history. The cruise terminal at South Locust Point sits where Baltimore clippers once raced to distant shores, and today's Caribbean-bound ships carry passengers along routes those swift privateers would recognize. The Inner Harbor's waterfront — home to historic warships, restored sailing vessels, and the birthplace of our National Anthem — makes this homeport feel less like a departure point and more like a pilgrimage to the waters that shaped a nation.</p>

          <p>The port sits just minutes from downtown, with easy access from I-95, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and BWI Airport. Whether you're driving from D.C., Philadelphia, or beyond, Baltimore's central location on the Chesapeake makes it an ideal embarkation point for Mid-Atlantic cruisers seeking Caribbean warmth without the flight south.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>Logbook Note:</strong> I always arrive a day early — there's too much history here to rush. Walk the ramparts where the flag still waves at Fort McHenry, tour the USS <em>Constellation</em> at Inner Harbor, and savor steamed blue crabs with Old Bay at a waterfront table. This is Chesapeake country, and it deserves your time.

          <h3>Getting to the Port</h3>
          <p>The cruise terminal is located at 2001 East McComas Street in South Baltimore's Locust Point neighborhood, about 3 miles from the Inner Harbor and 10 miles from BWI Airport.</p>

There's something fitting about approaching the ramparts from the water, as Francis Scott Key did in 1814. $14 all-day pass. <a href="https://baltimorewatertaxi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Water Taxi</a></li>
            <li><strong>Light Rail:</strong> Connects BWI Airport to downtown Camden Yards station — $1.90 fare</li>

          <h3>Pre-Cruise Activities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fort McHenry National Monument & Historic Shrine:</strong> Every time I stand on these ramparts, I feel the weight of that September night in 1814. The fort — designed by French engineer Jean Foncin and built between 1798 and 1800 — endured a 25-hour British bombardment on September 13-14, 1814. Francis Scott Key witnessed the assault from a truce ship in the harbor, and when dawn broke to reveal the garrison flag still flying, he penned the words that became our National Anthem. That flag was no accident: Baltimore flag-maker Mary Pickersgill sewed the enormous 30×42-foot banner for $405.90, intentionally designing it so large that "the British would not miss it." Today, Fort McHenry stands as the only site in the National Park System designated both a National Monument and Historic Shrine. When the 49th and 50th stars were added to our flag, they were first flown here. Take the Baltimore Water Taxi for a scenic approach, just as Key did. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/fomc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS Fort McHenry</a></li>
            <li><strong>Inner Harbor Historic Ships:</strong> The Inner Harbor is a living maritime museum. I always spend an afternoon exploring the fleet: the USS <em>Constellation</em> (1854 sloop-of-war and the last all-sail warship built by the U.S. Navy), the USCGC <em>Taney</em> (Coast Guard cutter and last surviving warship from Pearl Harbor), the submarine USS <em>Torsk</em> (WWII fleet submarine with the last torpedoes fired in combat in WWII), and the Lightship <em>Chesapeake</em> (floating lighthouse that once marked the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay). Each vessel tells a chapter of American naval history, and walking their decks connects you to the sailors who served.</li>
            <li><strong>Pride of Baltimore II:</strong> When in port, this stunning topsail schooner — a replica of the War of 1812-era Baltimore clippers that served as swift privateers — offers a glimpse of the vessels that made Baltimore famous. These "pride of Baltimore" ships were the fastest afloat, capturing British merchant vessels and cementing Baltimore's maritime reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>National Aquarium:</strong> World-class exhibits including sharks, dolphins, jellyfish, and the Australian Wild exhibit — plan 2-3 hours for a thorough visit</li>
            <li><strong>Fells Point:</strong> This 18th-century waterfront neighborhood — once home to shipbuilders, sailors, and immigrants — retains its cobblestone streets and maritime character. With 120+ bars and restaurants along the waterfront, it's where I go for an authentic taste of old Baltimore.</li>
            <li><strong>Camden Yards:</strong> Catch an Orioles game at the ballpark that revolutionized stadium design — opened 1992, it inspired every retro ballpark that followed and brought baseball back to urban neighborhoods</li>
            <li><strong>Maryland Blue Crabs:</strong> The iconic Chesapeake experience. Order them steamed with Old Bay, grab a wooden mallet, and prepare to work for your supper. LP Steamers, Captain James Landing, or Thames Street Oyster House are my go-to spots — all serve crabs the way they're meant to be: whole, hot, and piled high on brown paper.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
          <p>Baltimore's waters have witnessed some of America's most defining moments. On that September night in 1814, as British bombs and rockets arced over the Patapsco River toward Fort McHenry's ramparts, the fate of a young nation hung in the balance. The fort — a five-pointed star designed by French engineer Jean Foncin — held through 25 hours of bombardment, and when Francis Scott Key saw Mary Pickersgill's enormous garrison flag still flying at dawn, he knew the city had survived. That 30×42-foot flag, sewn for $405.90 and intentionally made large enough that "the British would not miss it," now rests in the Smithsonian. But its spirit still flies here, at the only site in America designated both a National Monument and Historic Shrine.</p>
          <p>The port itself dates to 1706, making it one of America's oldest working harbors. This was clipper ship country — Baltimore's swift privateers, the "pride of Baltimore," were the fastest vessels afloat during the War of 1812, capturing British merchant ships and cementing the city's maritime reputation. The Inner Harbor's historic fleet — <em>Constellation</em>, <em>Taney</em>, <em>Torsk</em>, and <em>Chesapeake</em> — spans a century of naval history, from Civil War sail to World War II steel. Walking these decks, I'm reminded that every cruise from Baltimore carries echoes of the sailors, shipwrights, and patriots who made this harbor what it is: a gateway to the world, built on courage and seamanship.</p>

          <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Crab Season:</strong> Maryland blue crabs are best April through November — ordering "steamed crabs" means whole crabs with Old Bay, mallets included</li>
            <li><strong>Port to Harbor:</strong> The cruise terminal is 3 miles from Inner Harbor — plan for taxi/rideshare; there's no direct public transit connection</li>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Hot and humid summers, cold winters — spring and fall cruises offer the best weather</li>
            <li><strong>Orioles Schedule:</strong> If the O's are home, arrive extra early — Camden Yards traffic affects port access</li>
