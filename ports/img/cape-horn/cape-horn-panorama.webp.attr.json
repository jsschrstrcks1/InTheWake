  "description": "Cape Horn is the southernmost point of the Tierra Del Fuego archipelago of Southern Chile, and marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet. For decades after its 1616 discovery, it was a milestone for the clipper route by which sailing ships carried trade around the world (Wikipedia). Unfortunately, it was also a graveyard for sailing ships due to strong winds, large waves, strong currents, and icebergs. The 1914 opening of the Panama Canal greatly reduced the need for ships to traverse this dangerous passage. The image was acquired December 20, 2009, covers an area of 28.3 by 36.0 kilometers, and is located at 56 degrees south, 67.3 degrees west.",
