      <h3>Bayamo Review: NCL's Latin Kitchen Hits More Than It Misses</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Bayamo is NCL's Latin American specialty restaurant, found on Norwegian Escape and select ships. It draws from Cuban, Mexican, and broader Caribbean flavors with a specialty dining surcharge ($25-35 or a dining credit from Free at Sea). The menu leans heavily on bold spices, grilled meats, and seafood with tropical fruit accents. Reservations are recommended.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The Empanadas de Carne are the best starter — flaky pastry, well-seasoned beef, chimichurri that actually has bite. The Ceviche is fresh and bright, with proper acid balance and a nice kick of habanero. For mains, the Churrasco Steak is the star: a beautifully charred skirt steak with plantain chips and a cilantro-lime sauce that brings everything together. The Ropa Vieja is tender and flavorful — slow-braised beef in a tomato sofrito that tastes authentically Cuban. Where it falls short: the Arroz con Pollo is surprisingly bland for a Latin kitchen — it needs more seasoning and the rice can be overcooked. The fish tacos feel like they belong at a pool bar, not a specialty restaurant. Dessert-wise, the Tres Leches cake is a must — moist, not too sweet, with a caramel drizzle that elevates it. The Churros are crispy but come with a generic chocolate sauce that doesn't match the kitchen's ambition elsewhere.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Service is warm and well-paced. Waitstaff know the menu and can guide you toward the stronger dishes. They're also honest about portion sizes, which helps avoid over-ordering. The sommelier pairing (Latin wines, a few solid Malbecs) is worth exploring. Expect 90 minutes for a full dinner. The only issue is inconsistency across sailings — one cruise might have a kitchen firing on all cylinders, the next might feel slightly rushed.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The dining room has a lively, colorful aesthetic — warm oranges, exposed brick touches, Latin music at a level that adds energy without drowning conversation. It feels festive without being theme-park. On Escape, the location is in the restaurant row on Deck 8, which concentrates the specialty dining crowd and gives the whole area a buzzy, going-out-to-dinner feel.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.9/5.</strong> Bayamo delivers bold Latin flavors with genuine highlights — the Churrasco and Empanadas are specialty-dining worthy, and the Tres Leches is one of the best desserts in the NCL fleet. It loses points for the bland Arroz con Pollo and inconsistent execution across sailings. <em>Tip:</em> Use your Free at Sea dining credit here — it's a better value than many other specialty options, and order the Churrasco medium-rare.</p>
