        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Cartagena's walled city is a UNESCO jewel box of colonial architecture, colorful balconies dripping with bougainvillea, emerald museums, and street life that makes you want to dance salsa at 3 p.m. It's South America's most beautiful port, full stop.

      <h1>Cartagena: My Walled City Wonder</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>We sailed in past the modern skyline and suddenly the old fortifications appeared like something from Pirates of the Caribbean. The cruise terminal is a 10-minute taxi into the walled city, and the second we passed through the clock tower gate I knew this day would rank top-five ever. The streets are a maze of mustard-yellow churches, emerald-green balconies, and palenqueras in fruit-bowl hats offering photos (tip them!).</p>

        <p>We walked the walls at golden hour first — 500-year-old ramparts with cannons still pointing at the sea, breeze carrying arepa smells and salsa music. Then wandered Getsemaní neighborhood — street art exploding on every wall, locals playing dominoes on plastic chairs, kids kicking soccer balls. Plaza de la Trinidad at dusk was pure joy: food carts, dancers, and a 10-year-old who schooled everyone at breakdancing.</p>

        <p>Lunch was at La Cevicheria (Anthony Bourdain's favorite) — octopus ceviche so fresh it tasted like the ocean, coconut lemonade that should be illegal. Afternoon was the Gold Museum (free!) and then the Inquisition Palace — creepy instruments but fascinating history. Ended with sunset from Café del Mar on the walls — passionfruit mojitos while the sky turned neon over the Caribbean.</p>

        <p>Pros: Insanely photogenic, incredible food, locals proud and welcoming.</p>
        <p>Cons: Hot and humid; street vendors can be persistent (a polite "no gracias" works).</p>

        <p>Practical tips: Wear light clothing and comfortable shoes — the cobblestones are brutal. Stay in the walled city and Getsemaní — perfectly safe and vibrant. Use only official yellow taxis or Uber.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on the city walls at sunset, watching the sky explode orange behind the cathedral domes while a street band below played "La Bicicleta" and the entire plaza started singing along — I had actual tears in my eyes from how beautiful life can be.

        <h3>Positively Worded Word of Warning</h3>
        <p>Cartagena is very safe inside the tourist areas, but keep valuables in a money belt and stick to busy streets after dark — common sense goes a long way.</p>
