              <p>
                The Petronas Towers appeared through the morning haze like
                silver minarets reaching toward heaven—88 stories of Islamic
                geometry made manifest in steel and glass. But it was in the
                shadow of those towers, at a street corner hawker stall, that
                Kuala Lumpur truly revealed itself. An elderly Chinese man
                tossed char kway teow in a wok so seasoned it had become
                geological. A Malay family waited for their roti canai. An
                Indian grandmother counted change for her grandson's teh tarik.
                This is Malaysia's genius: a nation where three great
                civilizations cook side by side, argue about whose food is best,
                and agree only that the answer is "all of it."

                At Batu Caves, climbing those 272 steps past cheeky macaques
                while sweat poured freely, I understood why Hindus chose this
                limestone cathedral. When you enter the main cave and see
                sunlight streaming through the collapsed ceiling onto the
                shrine, it feels like standing inside a geode that God cracked
                open.

            <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
            <p>
              Port Klang is Malaysia's largest and busiest port, handling cargo
              and cruise ships alike. The Boustead Cruise Centre provides
              modern terminal facilities including air-conditioning, currency
              exchange, and tourism information. Ships dock directly at the
              pier—no tendering required.
            </p>
            <p>
              The port area itself offers little of interest, so plan to head
              into Kuala Lumpur. Most cruise lines offer organized excursions,
              but independent exploration is straightforward if you arrange
              transportation in advance.
            </p>

          <section class="port-section" id="getting-to-kl">
            <h2>Getting to Kuala Lumpur</h2>
            <p>
              The 45km journey to Kuala Lumpur city center takes 45-90 minutes
              depending on notorious KL traffic. Rush hours (7-9am, 5-8pm)
              should be avoided if possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Transportation Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ship Excursions</strong>: Most reliable option with
                guaranteed return. Full-day KL tours typically $100-150 per
                person including major attractions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Private Transfers</strong>: Arrange through the ship or
                book ahead via Klook/Viator. Expect $60-100 round trip for a
                private car.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Grab (Ride-hailing)</strong>: Malaysia's dominant
                ride-share app. $25-40 each way, but finding return rides from
                KL can be uncertain.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>KTM Komuter Train</strong>: The adventurous option.
                Inexpensive (~$3) but requires taxi to Port Klang KTM station
                first, then 1+ hour train journey.
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Batu Caves</strong>: Massive limestone caves housing
                Hindu shrines, reached by climbing 272 rainbow-painted steps.
                The giant golden Lord Murugan statue stands 43 meters tall.
                Beware: macaques will steal food and shiny objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Merdeka Square</strong>: Historic heart of the city

            <p>
              Malaysia's food scene represents arguably the most delicious
              intersection of Chinese, Malay, and Indian cuisines on Earth.
              Hawker centers and kopitiams (coffee shops) offer the best value

            <h2>Practical Information</h2>
            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>
              Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) is the local currency. Approximately 4.5
              MYR = 1 USD (2025). Major credit cards accepted at malls and
              larger restaurants. Hawker stalls typically require cash. ATMs
              widely available. Change money at licensed money changers for
              better rates than banks.
            </p>

            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
              Hot and humid year-round with temperatures typically 24-32°C
              (75-90°F). Afternoon thunderstorms common, especially
              October-March. Carry an umbrella and stay hydrated. Malls provide
              welcome air-conditioned respite.
            </p>

            <h3>Etiquette</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remove shoes when entering homes, temples, and mosques.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dress modestly for religious sites—cover shoulders and knees.
                Some temples provide sarongs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use your right hand for eating and passing items; the left hand
                is considered unclean.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pointing with fingers is rude; use your whole hand or thumb
                instead.

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Kuala Lumpur is generally safe for tourists. Petty theft and bag
              snatching occur—keep valuables secure. Use registered taxis or
              Grab rather than unmarked cars. Watch for traffic when
              crossing—pedestrians do not have right of way.

                <summary>How far is Kuala Lumpur from Port Klang?</summary>
                <p>
                  Kuala Lumpur city center is approximately 45km (28 miles) from
                  Port Klang. The drive takes 45-90 minutes depending on

                  reliable options.

                <p>
                  Yes, but book Skybridge tickets in advance online. The towers
                  are open 9am-9pm. Allow 2-3 hours for the visit plus travel
                  time. Many ship excursions include Petronas Towers entry.

                <summary>Is Batu Caves worth visiting from Port Klang?</summary>
                <p>
                  Absolutely. Batu Caves is about 1 hour from Port Klang and
                  features a massive golden statue of Lord Murugan and 272 steps
                  to Hindu shrines inside limestone caves. Dress modestly.

                <summary>What is the best Malaysian food to try?</summary>
                <p>
                  Must-try dishes include nasi lemak (coconut rice with sambal),
                  char kway teow (fried noodles), roti canai (flatbread with
                  curry), and laksa (spicy noodle soup). Street food hawker

                <p>
                  Yes, English is widely spoken throughout Malaysia as a legacy
                  of British colonial rule. Signs are typically bilingual. You
                  should have no communication difficulties in tourist areas.
