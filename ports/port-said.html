              <p>
                The ship entered the canal at dawn, sliding between Africa on
                our port side and Asia to starboard—two continents close
                enough to hit with a well-thrown stone. A hundred and fifty
                years ago, Ferdinand de Lesseps made the desert give way to
                salt water, and now container ships the size of floating cities
                pass through this improbable ditch as routinely as commuters
                on a highway. We spent twelve hours sailing through sand, past
                Bedouin camps and military outposts, egrets standing patient
                in the shallows.

              <p class="logbook-entry__highlight">
                At Giza, the Great Pyramid rose from Cairo's smog like a
                mountain that had wandered into the wrong neighborhood. I've
                seen photographs my entire life; I thought I knew what to
                expect. I did not. Standing at its base, craning my neck at
                limestone blocks each weighing more than an automobile, stacked
                with precision we struggle to match with computers, I felt
                appropriately small. The Sphinx watched with the patience of
                forty-five centuries.

            <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
            <p>
              Port Said sits at the Mediterranean entrance to the Suez Canal,
              one of the world's most strategic waterways. The port serves both
              as a cruise destination and as a transit point for ships passing
              between the Mediterranean and Red Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cruise terminal area is functional but not tourist-oriented.
              Security is tight. Most passengers book ship excursions to Cairo
              or explore the immediate port area before reboarding.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="port-section" id="cairo">
            <h2>Cairo & Pyramids Excursion</h2>
            <p>
              The pyramids are the reason most travelers visit Port Said. Cairo
              is approximately 200km (125 miles) south—a 3-4 hour drive each
              way depending on traffic. This makes for a long but unforgettable
              day.
            </p>
            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pyramids of Giza</strong>: The Great Pyramid of Khufu, Pyramid of Khafre, Pyramid of Menkaure, and the Sphinx.</li>
              <li><strong>Egyptian Museum</strong>: Many tours include the Cairo museum with Tutankhamun treasures (or the new Grand Egyptian Museum if open).</li>
              <li><strong>Total Time</strong>: 10-12 hours including transport.</li>
              <li><strong>Fatigue</strong>: Expect exhaustion. Desert heat, crowds, and travel time are draining.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Booking Recommendations</h3>
            <p>
              Ship excursions are strongly recommended for Egypt. They handle
              logistics, security, and the guarantee of return to the ship.
              Private tours through reputable agencies are an alternative but
              require careful vetting.
            </p>

          <section class="port-section" id="port-said-city">
            <h2>Port Said City</h2>
            <p>
              If you're not doing the Cairo excursion, Port Said itself has
              some historical interest. The city was founded in 1859 during
              canal construction and retains colonial-era architecture along
              the waterfront.
            </p>
            <h3>Points of Interest</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Al-Salam Canal</strong>: Watch ships transit the canal from viewing points.</li>
              <li><strong>Military Museum</strong>: Covers the 1956, 1967, and 1973 conflicts.</li>
              <li><strong>Downtown Architecture</strong>: Faded colonial buildings recall the city's cosmopolitan past.</li>
              <li><strong>Free Zone Markets</strong>: Shopping area, though quality varies.</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="port-section" id="practical">
            <h2>Practical Information</h2>
            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>
              Egyptian Pound (EGP). Approximately 30 EGP = 1 USD (2025). USD
              widely accepted at tourist sites but local currency gets better
              prices. ATMs available but may be unreliable.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
              Egypt has improved security significantly. Tourist police are
              visible at major sites. Remain with your group, follow guide
              instructions, and be aware of surroundings. Petty harassment
              from vendors can be persistent but is rarely dangerous.
            </p>
            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
              Hot and dry most of the year. Summer temperatures regularly
              exceed 35°C (95°F). Spring and fall are more comfortable for
              sightseeing. Bring sun protection and plenty of water.
            </p>
            <h3>Tips for Giza</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Bring small bills for tips—they're expected everywhere.</li>
              <li>Decline aggressive camel ride offers unless you've negotiated price in advance.</li>
              <li>Photography inside tombs often requires separate tickets.</li>
              <li>Wear comfortable shoes—you'll walk on sand and uneven stone.</li>
            </ul>
