                        <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> North Star is a jewel-shaped glass observation capsule exclusive to Quantum Class ships that rises 300+ feet above sea level. Basic rides are complimentary with your cruise fare—book via the Royal Caribbean app on embarkation day. For the best experience, choose a sunset time slot and book within the first hour of boarding.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>North Star represents one of Royal Caribbean's most innovative attractions—a stunning engineering achievement that gives passengers a bird's-eye view of their ship and the surrounding seascape. The jewel-shaped glass capsule is attached to a robotic arm that gently lifts guests 300 feet above sea level while rotating 360 degrees for unobstructed panoramic views.</p>

                        <p>The experience lasts approximately 15-20 minutes, during which the capsule performs a graceful choreographed movement, rising, rotating, and extending over the ocean. Whether you're watching a sunset, approaching a port, or simply enjoying endless ocean views, North Star delivers a perspective unlike anything else at sea.</p>

                        <h3>The Technology</h3>
                        <p>North Star utilizes advanced robotic arm technology adapted from shipyard cranes. The capsule is climate-controlled with floor-to-ceiling glass panels and can operate in winds up to 30 knots. Safety features include multiple redundant systems and the capsule remains level throughout the entire experience regardless of ship movement.</p>
