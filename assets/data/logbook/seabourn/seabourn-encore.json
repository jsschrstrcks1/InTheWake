Encore added capacity but also added space: more deck area per guest, more dining options, larger spa facilities. The ship grew guests and amenities proportionally.\n\n[Seabourn Ovation](/ships/seabourn/seabourn-ovation.html) followed in 2018 with identical design, validating the Encore Class approach. The pair now serves as Seabourn's primary conventional cruise vessels.\n\nDesign collaboration with hospitality designer Adam D. Tihany brought fresh perspective. Public spaces feel residential rather than nautical. The aesthetic positions Encore as boutique hotel that happens to sail.\n\nFor fleet context: Encore represents Seabourn's careful growth\u2014larger capacity that expanded rather than diluted the intimate experience. The balance defines the Encore Class.",

      "markdown": "**I booked my first solo cruise at fifty-three, recently divorced and terrified of eating alone in restaurants.**\n\nThe fear felt absurd for a woman who had managed corporate teams for decades. But there I was, standing outside The Restaurant on the first evening, frozen by the prospect of requesting a table for one. A staff member named Elena noticed me hovering near the entrance. Without making me feel observed, she approached warmly and asked if I might enjoy joining a table of fellow travelers she thought I would find interesting.\n\nThat simple act of noticing\u2014of genuine hospitality rather than transactional service\u2014changed everything about my voyage.\n\nElena had seated me with Margaret, a retired professor from Edinburgh, and David, a widowed architect from Melbourne. We became inseparable. Breakfast together in The Colonnade. Afternoon tea in the Observation Bar. Dinners that stretched into philosophical conversations none of us had enjoyed in years.\n\nMy butler, Thomas, learned my rhythms quickly. He noticed I returned to my Veranda Suite exhausted after social evenings but energized after quiet afternoons reading on my private veranda. Without my asking, he began leaving a pot of chamomile tea waiting after dinner gatherings, and ensuring the afternoon turndown included fresh coffee and the international newspapers I favored.\n\nThe crisis came mid-voyage when I received news that my mother had been hospitalized back home. I was thousands of miles away, panicked, unable to think clearly about whether to disembark at the next port. The ship's guest services team\u2014alerted somehow by Thomas\u2014arranged an immediate satellite call to my mother's doctor. They researched flight options from our next three ports. They offered to hold a suite on the return voyage at no additional charge if I needed to leave.\n\nI stayed. My mother insisted. But the crew's response in that moment of terror showed me what all-inclusive truly means on Seabourn. It means being held by people who notice when you're struggling.\n\nI have traveled solo on Encore twice more since that first voyage. Each time, Elena greets me by name. Each time, Thomas remembers exactly how I take my morning coffee. I no longer fear dining alone. On Seabourn Encore, I discovered that solo doesn't mean solitary\u2014it means freedom to find your people on your own terms.\n\n**The lesson:** Solitude doesn't have to mean isolation. The best crews understand that solo travelers need connection on their own terms. *'Two are better than one... if either of them falls down, one can help the other up.'* (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10).

      "markdown": "**My grandmother turned ninety at sea, surrounded by four generations of women who loved her.**\n\nPlanning the voyage had been complicated. Grandma used a wheelchair for longer distances. My mother, at sixty-eight, tired easily after her knee replacement. My teenage daughter declared she would die of boredom without WiFi. My six-year-old needed constant supervision near water. The logistics seemed impossible until our butler, Antonio, took charge.\n\nHe learned each of our needs during the first day. For Grandma, he arranged a wheelchair-accessible table in The Restaurant with extra space for her mobility aide. For my mother, he coordinated with the spa to schedule gentle water therapy sessions that eased her joint pain. For my sulking teenager, he somehow discovered that the ship's photography officer would mentor interested guests\u2014and my daughter spent the voyage learning to shoot portraits, her phone forgotten.\n\nFor my six-year-old, Antonio performed daily magic. Treasure hunts with chocolate coins hidden in our connecting Veranda Suites. Special arrangements with the galley for her favorite foods. A visit to the bridge where the captain let her hold the ship's wheel.\n\nThe crisis arrived on Grandma's birthday. We had planned a private dinner in The Grill by Thomas Keller\u2014reservations made months in advance. That morning, Grandma developed a fever. The ship's doctor diagnosed a minor infection, treatable but exhausting. She couldn't possibly manage the restaurant.\n\nI was devastated. This was meant to be her moment. We had flown from four different cities to celebrate her.\n\nAntonio knocked on our suite door at five o'clock. Behind him stood two servers carrying linens, crystal, silver, and flowers. They transformed Grandma's suite into a private dining room. The Grill's executive chef sent every course we had ordered, adapted for bedside service. The sommelier brought the champagne we had selected. Even the restaurant's signature tableside preparations happened in that suite.\n\nGrandma sat propped against pillows in her silk robe, laughing at her great-granddaughter's jokes, watching her daughter and granddaughter finally relaxed after months of planning stress. When the birthday cake arrived\u2014a recreation of her wedding cake from 1956, based on a photograph my mother had secretly provided\u2014she wept.\n\nWe all did.\n\nSeabourn didn't just accommodate our complicated family. They understood that the accommodation was the point. That making space for a ninety-year-old woman to feel celebrated, despite everything, was what ultra-luxury actually means.\n\n**The lesson:** Multi-generational travel works when the ship works harder than your family does. *'Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.'* (Proverbs 17:6)",

The Seabourn Encore cruise\u2014two weeks through the Mediterranean\u2014represented everything we had dreamed about during lockdowns. When Michael's test came back positive, I sat on our bathroom floor and sobbed.\n\nSeabourn's response changed everything. Their guest services team called within hours of our cancellation request. They didn't just offer to rebook\u2014they rebuilt our entire voyage. A later departure date on the same ship. The same Penthouse Suite we had originally booked. Complimentary upgrade to include a private car transfer to the port. No fees, no complications, no stress.\n\nWhen we finally boarded Encore three weeks later, our butler Sophia was waiting with champagne and a handwritten card from the captain congratulating us on our marriage. She had been briefed on our story. She understood this voyage carried extra emotional weight.\n\nSophia orchestrated small romantic gestures throughout the cruise. Rose petals on the bed for our one-month anniversary. A private table on our veranda for breakfast, set with flowers that matched my wedding bouquet. Reservations at The Grill perfectly timed to watch the sunset over Santorini.\n\nThe most meaningful moment came in Dubrovnik. Michael had secretly arranged a vow renewal ceremony through the ship\u2014but the officiant fell ill the morning of. I found him in our suite, phone in hand, trying to salvage his surprise while pretending nothing was wrong.\n\nSophia noticed his distress. Within two hours, she had located an English-speaking local officiant, secured permissions for a ceremony at a medieval church overlooking the harbor, and arranged for the ship's florist to create a small bouquet. She even coordinated with The Colonnade to pack an elegant picnic for afterward.\n\nWe renewed our vows on a cliff above the Adriatic, just the two of us and an ancient stone church. The ship's photographer captured images we will treasure forever. That evening, the restaurant staff had somehow decorated our usual table with the same flowers from the ceremony.\n\nOur honeymoon wasn't perfect. It was better\u2014it taught us that marriage means adapting together, and that the right support transforms obstacles into memories. Seabourn Encore didn't just host our honeymoon. They helped begin our marriage.\n\n**The lesson:** The best honeymoon isn't the one you planned\u2014it's the one that teaches you partnership through challenge. *'Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.'* (Ecclesiastes 4:9)",

      "markdown": "**My wife and I worked for forty-three years to afford a vacation like this.**\n\nI drove a delivery truck. Martha taught elementary school. We raised three kids in a small house in Ohio and never once flew first class. When I retired at sixty-seven, Martha handed me a Seabourn brochure and said it was time to finally treat ourselves.\n\nI was terrified we wouldn't belong.\n\nEverything about Seabourn Encore seemed designed for sophisticated travelers who knew which fork to use and how to pronounce French wines. We were meat-and-potatoes people from Toledo. I worried the crew would see through us immediately.\n\nOur butler, Gregory, eliminated that fear within hours. He didn't treat us like rubes to be educated or wealthy guests to be flattered. He treated us like interesting people whose preferences mattered. When I admitted I didn't understand the wine list, he didn't condescend\u2014he asked what flavors I enjoyed with dinner and made recommendations that matched. When Martha mentioned she struggled with stairs, he quietly arranged for us to always use elevators and reserved tables in The Restaurant that didn't require navigating steps.\n\nThe health scare came on day four. I woke at three in the morning with chest pains. Martha panicked. So did I\u2014my father died of a heart attack at sixty-two, and I was sixty-seven with no doctor for thousands of miles.\n\nThe ship's medical team responded within minutes of Martha's call. Dr. Andersen\u2014a cardiologist who happened to be the ship's physician\u2014ran an EKG in our suite. Severe indigestion, not cardiac. But he didn't dismiss my fear. He sat with us for an hour, explaining the results, showing me exactly why he was confident, arranging follow-up monitoring for the rest of the voyage.\n\nGregory appeared the next morning with chamomile tea, bland toast, and a gentle schedule of activities that wouldn't tax my still-nervous system. He had coordinated with the medical team and the spa to suggest treatments that would help me relax. That afternoon, Martha and I sat in the spa's thermal suite, holding hands, watching the Mediterranean slide past, and I realized I had never felt so cared for in my adult life.\n\nWe have cruised on Encore three times since. Each voyage, Gregory requests to be our butler. Each voyage, he remembers that I prefer whiskey to wine and that Martha loves the lemon tart from The Colonnade. We worked hard our whole lives. Seabourn Encore reminds us we earned this.\n\n**The lesson:** Age is irrelevant when luxury means respect. Growing old deserves dignity, not diminishment. *'Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained in the way of righteousness.'* (Proverbs 16:31)",

From booking confirmation to memorial service took four months. The Seabourn voyage sat in my email like a wound\u2014proof of the future we had planned together, now impossible.\n\nMy daughter convinced me to go anyway. Robert would have wanted it, she said. I didn't believe her, but I went.\n\nI boarded Seabourn Encore clutching Robert's ashes in a small urn, feeling like a ghost haunting the vacation he should have taken. My butler, Emmanuel, noticed immediately that I was not a joyful traveler. He didn't pry. He simply created space for whatever I needed.\n\nThe first three days, I barely left my Veranda Suite. Emmanuel brought meals I didn't order but somehow wanted. He made sure the suite was always fresh but never disturbed my privacy. He left small touches\u2014a single flower, a handwritten note about the day's weather\u2014that reminded me life continued without demanding I participate.\n\nOn the fourth day, I ventured to The Colonnade for breakfast. A woman my age sat alone at the next table. We nodded politely. By lunch, we were talking. By dinner, I had learned that Susan had lost her husband two years before and had cruised alone ever since.\n\n\"The sea holds grief well,\" she told me. \"There's enough space out there for all of it.\"\n\nEmmanuel noticed our friendship forming. He began seating us together without being asked. He coordinated with the spa to book us adjacent treatment rooms. He arranged for a private table on the deck where Susan and I could watch sunsets and talk about the men we had loved.\n\nThe turning point came in Barcelona. I had mentioned to Emmanuel that Robert had always wanted to see La Sagrada Familia. That morning, a private tour awaited me\u2014just me and a guide who spent four hours showing me the cathedral Robert had dreamed about.\n\nI scattered some of his ashes in the Mediterranean that evening, from my veranda, as the sun set over the water. Emmanuel had placed a single rose and a glass of Robert's favorite whiskey beside me. He never said a word. He simply knew.\n\nI have cruised three times since, always on Encore when possible. Emmanuel still requests me as his guest. The grief has softened into gratitude. Robert never saw the ship, but somehow, through Seabourn's care, I carry him with me on every voyage.\n\n**The lesson:** Grief doesn't heal on a schedule, but it needs beautiful places to breathe. *'He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.'* (Psalm 147:3).

At forty-two, I discovered that Seabourn doesn't see my wheelchair\u2014they see me.**\n\nMost travel as a wheelchair user involves constant advocacy. Fighting for accessible rooms that turn out to have barriers. Negotiating with staff who see disability before personhood. Accepting that adventure means compromise.\n\nSeabourn Encore operated differently from the moment I boarded.\n\nMy butler, Dimitri, had clearly been briefed on my needs, but he led with curiosity about my preferences rather than assumptions about my limitations. What did I enjoy? What had I found frustrating on past travels? What would make this voyage exceptional rather than merely accessible?\n\nThe Veranda Suite designated as accessible exceeded expectations. Roll-in shower with proper grab bars. Lowered closet rods I could actually reach. A veranda with enough space for my chair and room to transfer to a lounge chair for sunbathing. These weren't afterthoughts\u2014they were designed.\n\nThe crisis came during a shore excursion in Monte Carlo. The accessible tour I had booked turned out to use a vehicle that couldn't actually accommodate my wheelchair\u2014a vendor error, not Seabourn's. I sat on the pier watching my group leave without me, fighting tears of frustration I thought I had outgrown years ago.\n\nDimitri had accompanied the group to ensure I was settled. When he saw what happened, he didn't apologize uselessly or offer platitudes. He pulled out his phone, made three calls, and within thirty minutes had arranged a private accessible vehicle and a local guide who specialized in mobility-accessible tours.\n\nI saw more of Monaco that day than the original group. My guide knew every elevator, every accessible entrance, every restaurant with step-free access. We had lunch at a caf\u00e9 overlooking the harbor that the walking tour couldn't have reached.\n\nThat evening, Seabourn's hotel director personally apologized and informed me that the shore excursion vendor had been contacted about the error. My excursion cost was refunded\u2014though I would have paid double for the experience I actually received.\n\nThe Colonnade's breakfast stations were all reachable from my chair. The Spa accommodated my transfers onto treatment tables with practiced ease. The Grill's staff moved tables without fuss to create space for my wheelchair. Every interaction assumed competence and welcomed presence.\n\nSeabourn Encore didn't accommodate my disability. They included me completely. There is a difference, and once you experience it, you never accept less.\n\n**The lesson:** Accessibility isn't about special treatment\u2014it's about equal dignity.

      "markdown": "**I had cruised twelve times on premium lines before boarding Seabourn Encore. I thought I understood luxury cruising. I understood nothing.**\n\nThe difference announced itself before I even reached my Veranda Suite. A crew member greeted me by name at the gangway\u2014not reading from a list, but genuinely welcoming me as if I were an expected guest at a private home. No lines. No waiting. No mass embarkation chaos. Just warmth and direction to my suite, where my butler Marcus was already waiting.\n\nMarcus. On premium lines, I had room stewards who appeared briefly twice daily. Marcus appeared to understand my life. Within the first hour, he had learned that I drank Earl Grey in the morning and chamomile at night, that I preferred sparkling water without ice, that I needed extra pillows for my back. He didn't write anything down. He simply knew.\n\nThe first evening challenged everything I thought I knew about cruise dining. I walked into The Restaurant without a reservation, without assigned seating, without formal dress code enforcement. The maitre d' asked simply where I would prefer to sit. I chose a table by the window. The meal that followed\u2014five courses of food that rivaled my best shore-side dining experiences\u2014came without surcharges, without calculated additions. Everything was included.\n\nMy confusion peaked at The Grill by Thomas Keller. On premium ships, specialty restaurants meant forty-dollar cover charges and carefully tracked spending. Here, the host simply welcomed me, seated me, and the legendary chef's menu unfolded without a single mention of cost. The tableside Caesar salad preparation, the perfectly cooked Dover sole, the vintage wine pairings\u2014all included.\n\nThe crisis came when I received news that my sister had been hospitalized back home. I was frozen in Seabourn Square, unable to process travel options through my panic. A guest services associate named Helena noticed my distress before I said a word. Within thirty minutes, she had arranged a satellite call to my sister's hospital, researched flight options from our next port, and coordinated with Marcus to pack my belongings should I need to disembark.\n\nI didn't need to leave\u2014my sister was stable. But Helena's response revealed the true difference. On premium ships, I was a booking number. On Seabourn Encore, with just 600 guests and nearly one crew member for every passenger, I was a person in crisis who deserved immediate care.\n\nMarcus brought chamomile tea to my suite that evening without my asking. He had noticed I hadn't appeared for dinner and knew something was wrong. The tea came with a handwritten note: \"Your sister is in our thoughts. Please let us know what you need.\"\n\nI have cruised only ultra-luxury since. The price difference is real. The experience difference is greater. Seabourn Encore taught me that genuine luxury isn't about thread counts or champagne\u2014it's about being seen, known, and cared for as an individual. Once you experience it, premium cruising feels like a pale imitation.\n\n**The lesson:** The price of true luxury isn't for the inclusions\u2014it's for never thinking about price again. That freedom is worth everything.",

      "markdown": "**After forty-seven cruises on every ultra-luxury line afloat, I can finally articulate what makes Seabourn different. It's not the ship. It's the soul.**\n\nI have sailed Regent, Silversea, Crystal before its demise, and Seabourn. I have opinions about each. My wife tolerates my detailed cruise journals and my tendency to evaluate every interaction like a hospitality auditor. When we boarded Seabourn Encore for a Mediterranean voyage, I came prepared to compare.\n\nThe service philosophy differs subtly but significantly. Other lines train crew to deliver scripted excellence. Seabourn trains crew to notice and respond. The distinction sounds theoretical until you experience it. At The Colonnade breakfast, a server named Paolo observed that I had skipped the eggs two days running. He appeared with a fruit plate and Greek yogurt arrangement he had composed based on what I had actually chosen. He wasn't following a system\u2014he was paying attention.\n\nThe Grill by Thomas Keller represents another differentiator. Other lines partner with celebrity chefs whose names appear on menus but whose influence ends there. Keller's training permeates The Grill's service philosophy\u2014the poise, the timing, the obsessive attention to detail in tableside preparations. This wasn't a licensing deal; this was genuine collaboration.\n\nThe challenge came when my wife developed severe food poisoning mid-voyage\u2014not from ship food, but from a questionable shore-side restaurant we had chosen against concierge advice. She was violently ill for thirty-six hours, unable to leave our suite, requiring IV fluids from the ship's medical team.\n\nOn other lines, this would have meant missed experiences and substantial medical bills. On Encore, our butler Sophia coordinated everything. She liaised with the medical team on appropriate foods as my wife recovered. She arranged for The Restaurant to prepare bland healing meals delivered to our suite on covered silver service. She rescheduled our specialty dining reservations for later in the voyage and ensured the medical charges were handled through our travel insurance with minimal paperwork on our end.\n\nMore remarkably, the captain himself sent a handwritten note wishing my wife well. The spa delivered complimentary aromatherapy to help her sleep. The Observation Bar's bartender prepared ginger-based drinks when she finally emerged, knowing\u2014because Sophia had informed him\u2014that her stomach remained sensitive.\n\nThe integration of care across departments distinguishes Seabourn. Other lines have excellent individual crew members. Seabourn has a system where 600 guests are genuinely tracked by a crew that communicates constantly. The nearly one-to-one crew ratio makes this possible, but the culture makes it real.\n\nMy cruise journal now contains forty-eight entries. Seabourn Encore ranks at the top. The difference isn't in the chandelier count or the thread count. It's in the human count\u2014staff who notice, respond, and care as if hosting family rather than processing passengers.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment. When comparison becomes unnecessary, you've found your answer.",

The surprise worked\u2014I boarded in Barcelona still processing the handshakes and farewell cards, still reaching for a pager that no longer existed. Forty years of defining myself as Dr. Patricia Summers, and suddenly I was just Patricia, with two weeks of Mediterranean sailing to figure out what that meant.\n\nOur butler, Alessandro, noticed my disorientation immediately. He asked gentle questions about what we hoped to experience. When I admitted I had never taken a vacation longer than one week in four decades, he simply nodded. \"Then we will help you remember how to rest,\" he said.\n\nThe Spa at Seabourn became my sanctuary. I had never had a massage in my life\u2014doctors tend to neglect their own bodies while caring for others. The therapist, Ingrid, spent the first session simply helping me understand how much tension I had accumulated. By the third treatment, I was weeping on the table, releasing decades of stored stress I hadn't known I carried.\n\nThe crisis came when I received an email from a former patient's family. A young woman I had treated for years had taken a turn for the worse. They wanted advice. For forty years, I would have immediately engaged, researched, responded. But I was no longer her doctor. I was no longer anyone's doctor.\n\nI sat in Seabourn Square, paralyzed between professional instinct and new reality. Alessandro found me there, staring at my phone. He didn't ask what was wrong. He simply sat nearby, present but not intrusive, until I was ready to speak.\n\nI told him I didn't know how to be retired. I didn't know how to let go of patients who still needed me. I didn't know who I was if I wasn't the person solving problems and saving lives.\n\nAlessandro's response surprised me. He told me about crew members who had worked on ships for decades before retiring, who struggled with the same loss of identity. \"The uniform was who they were,\" he said. \"Learning to be themselves without it takes time. But the self was always there, underneath.\"\n\nThat evening, he had arranged a special dinner at The Restaurant\u2014just my wife and me at a corner table, with a small cake that read \"To New Beginnings.\" The sommelier brought a bottle from my birth year. The maitre d' toasted my four decades of service to others.\n\nI cried again. But this time the tears felt like release rather than grief.\n\nI responded to the patient's family, offering comfort rather than medical advice. I referred them to my former colleagues. And then I closed the email and watched the sunset over the Mediterranean with my wife, practicing being Patricia instead of Dr. Summers.\n\nSeabourn Encore gave me space to mourn the identity I was leaving and permission to discover the person waiting underneath. Alessandro and the crew understood that retirement isn't just a celebration\u2014it's a transformation. They held space for both.\n\n**The lesson:** Milestone moments deserve milestone settings. The best celebrations honor both the journey and the arrival. *'This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.'* (Psalm 118:24)",

After eighteen months of burnout so severe I had stopped leaving my apartment, I boarded Seabourn Encore expecting nothing. What I found was permission to exist without producing.**\n\nThe burnout had accumulated over years of impossible workloads, toxic management, and the slow erosion of boundaries until I no longer remembered having any. I quit my job when I started having panic attacks in the parking lot. Then I spent eighteen months barely functioning\u2014sleeping fourteen hours, ordering delivery food, watching the world through windows I rarely opened.\n\nMy sister booked the cruise over my protests. She deposited me on Seabourn Encore in Lisbon with instructions to do nothing except breathe and eat. The ship, she reasoned, would contain me in comfort while I figured out how to rejoin the living.\n\nMy butler, Theodore, recognized something fragile in me immediately. He asked no cheerful questions about vacation plans. He simply showed me the suite's features with quiet competence, explained how to reach him if I needed anything, and left me alone. The pressure of social performance\u2014which I dreaded above all\u2014never materialized.\n\nThe first three days, I barely left my Veranda Suite. Theodore brought meals without judgment, leaving trays at my door so I didn't have to interact. He stocked the minibar with the specific sparkling water I mentioned liking. He adjusted the air conditioning when I mentioned sleeping poorly. Small attentions that required nothing in return.\n\nThe crisis came on day four when I attempted The Colonnade for breakfast. The room, though elegant, contained people\u2014people who might want to talk, to ask questions, to require social energy I didn't have. I froze at the entrance, unable to advance or retreat.\n\nA server named Maria noticed my paralysis. She didn't approach directly. She simply caught my eye, smiled gently, and gestured toward a small table in a corner, partially shielded by a column. Private but present. I could observe without participating.\n\nShe brought me tea without asking what I wanted, then breakfast items that required no decisions. Simple food. Quiet corner. No demands.\n\nThat table became my breakfast spot for the remaining voyage. Maria remembered my order and delivered it without requiring conversation. She understood\u2014through whatever wisdom servers develop observing human nature\u2014that I needed presence without pressure.\n\nThe Observation Bar at sunset became my evening ritual. The bartender, James, learned to place a specific wine at my usual seat before I arrived. I watched the ocean for hours, slowly remembering that beauty existed and that I was allowed to witness it without earning the privilege through productivity.\n\nTheodore coordinated everything without my asking. He informed the spa that I might appreciate treatments with minimal conversation. He ensured my preferred items restocked quietly. He created an infrastructure of care that required nothing from me.\n\nI didn't heal on Seabourn Encore\u2014healing takes longer than twelve days. But I remembered that rest was possible. That observation could replace production. That 600 guests and a crew that genuinely cared could hold space for someone barely able to hold herself.\n\nThe sea taught me to float again. Theodore and the crew taught me I was worth teaching.\n\n**The lesson:** Medicine can cure disease, but healing requires beauty, care, and permission to want things again. *'He restores my soul.'* (Psalm 23:3)",
