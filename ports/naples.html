      <h1>Naples: Pizza, Pompeii, and Controlled Chaos</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Naples will assault your senses. That's not a warning — it's a promise. Within minutes of stepping off the ship, you'll be surrounded by Vespas weaving through pedestrians, shop owners calling out, the smell of pizza dough and diesel, laundry hanging between baroque churches, and a general glorious mayhem that feels more genuine than anywhere else in Italy. Naples is loud, gritty, overwhelming, and absolutely magnificent. This is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world — founded by Greeks from Cumae around 600 BCE as Neapolis, "the New City" — and those 2,800 years of unbroken history are layered into every cobblestone, every crumbling palazzo, every gesture and shout in the street.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/naples/naples-1.webp" alt="Naples harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Naples — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Naples&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>The Greeks who came here weren't starting from nothing. Settlers from Rhodes had already established themselves back in the 9th century BC on the tiny island of Megaride — where Castel dell'Ovo now stands, its honey-colored stones rising from the sea like something out of a fairy tale. Later, when Greeks from nearby Cumae arrived around 600 BCE, they built their "new city" beside the older settlement, Palaepolis. Standing at that castle today, gazing across the Bay of Naples toward Vesuvius smoking gently on the horizon, I felt the weight of centuries beneath my feet. This same rocky outcrop witnessed the exile of Romulus Augustulus, the last Western Roman Emperor, in 476 AD — the final flicker of Rome's ancient flame extinguished on this small island, while empires rose and fell and the city endured.</p>

        <p>I've been to Naples twice on Mediterranean itineraries, and both times I faced the same dilemma every cruiser faces: Pompeii, Amalfi Coast, or Naples itself? The answer, frustratingly, is that they're all unmissable. You can't do all three properly in one port day. So you choose, and you promise yourself you'll come back for the rest. The shadow of Mount Vesuvius looms over every decision — Europe's only active volcano on the mainland, still smoking gently on the horizon, a constant reminder of both beauty and danger. That mountain destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum in AD 79, burying entire cities under ash and pumice so swiftly that families were frozen mid-gesture, loaves of bread left carbonized in ovens, dogs still chained in courtyards. The catastrophe preserved a moment in time with such fidelity that walking those ancient streets nearly two thousand years later feels like trespassing on someone's interrupted afternoon.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

        <p>My first visit, I chose Pompeii. The Circumvesuviana train from Naples Central Station is the cheapest way there — €3.90 each way, 35 minutes — though it's notoriously rough around the edges (watch your belongings). The ruins, when I arrived, silenced every criticism. Here was a Roman city frozen in time: streets with stepping stones for pedestrians to cross without stepping in waste, taverns with painted menus on the walls, a brothel with explicit frescoes to help patrons select services, a bakery with mills and oven intact. I walked the main streets, peered into homes where families died huddled together, and stood in the amphitheater imagining gladiatorial combat. It's enormous — plan at least 3–4 hours and bring water, because there's little shade. The preservation is so complete that you can see the ruts worn into stone streets by Roman cart wheels, read ancient graffiti on walls ("Successus the weaver loves the innkeeper's slave girl" — some things never change), and stand in the Forum where citizens gathered two millennia ago, their voices echoing in a language we can still read but no longer hear.</p>

        <p>My second visit, I did a ship excursion to the Amalfi Coast and Sorrento. The drive along that coastline — hairpin turns carved into cliffs above a turquoise sea — was worth it alone. We stopped in Positano, that famous cascade of pastel houses tumbling down to the Mediterranean, and I understood why artists have been coming here for centuries. Then Ravello, perched high above the coast with gardens that seem to float in the sky. Sorrento was more refined, with its lemon groves and views across the Bay of Naples to Vesuvius. But the excursion was rushed, as ship excursions to the Amalfi Coast always are. You get a taste, not a meal. To really experience those cliffside villages — to watch the sunset paint them gold, to hear the church bells echo across the water — you'd need to stay overnight.</p>

        <p>What I didn't do on those first visits — and regret — was spend real time in Naples itself. The city deserves it. In 1995, UNESCO designated the historic center a World Heritage Site, recognizing what locals have always known: this tangled maze of narrow streets is a living archive where Greek, Roman, medieval, and baroque layers collapse into each other. The Naples Archaeological Museum — housed in a massive palazzo that looks like it could contain entire civilizations (and does) — holds the world's finest collection of artifacts from Pompeii and Herculaneum. I mean the actual frescoes peeled from villa walls, the mosaics that once graced patrician floors, the bronze statues pulled from the ash, the "Secret Cabinet" of erotic art that scandalized Victorian visitors and still makes modern tourists blush. To walk Pompeii's ruins without first seeing these treasures in the museum is to see only half the story.</p>

        <p>The Spaccanapoli — that impossibly narrow street that "splits Naples" through the old quarter — is lined with churches dripping with baroque gold, workshops where artisans still carve nativity scenes by hand, and pizza shops that have been feeding families for generations. Medieval fortresses guard the waterfront, their weathered stones witnessing centuries of conquest and commerce. This is a city that refuses to become a museum version of itself, a city where the old ways persist not as performance but as life.</p>

        <p>And then there's the pizza. Naples invented pizza. Not as a brand claim but as historical fact — this is where the Margherita was created in 1889 for Queen Margherita of Savoy, its red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil representing the Italian flag. Pizzeria da Michele has been making pizza since 1870, still serving only two kinds: Margherita and Marinara. The pizza here is different from what you get anywhere else: a soft, charred crust with the center nearly soupy with San Marzano tomatoes and fresh buffalo mozzarella, the dough made from Neapolitan flour and left to rise slowly, baked in wood-fired ovens at temperatures that would make lesser pizzas weep. I ate mine at a place near Via dei Tribunali where locals lined up, standing at the counter because there were no tables. It was the best pizza I've ever had, and it cost €5. That's Naples — world-changing cuisine served without ceremony, because here it's just lunch.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in the Forum of Pompeii at the exact spot where Roman citizens once gathered, looking up at Vesuvius smoking gently on the horizon. The same volcano that destroyed this city in AD 79 is still active, still watching. And Naples sprawls at its feet anyway, five million people living in its shadow because this land is too beautiful, too fertile, too alive to abandon. That's Italy in a nutshell: beauty and danger, history and defiance, all coexisting in glorious tension.
        </div>

        <p>Vesuvius itself can be visited — buses and tours go to a parking lot near the summit, then you walk the final stretch to peer into the crater. It's less dramatic than you might hope (no bubbling lava), but the views are spectacular and there's something primal about standing on an active volcano. Combined with Pompeii, it makes a full day.</p>

        <p>Naples is not for everyone. It's hectic, the driving is terrifying, and the city has a reputation (often overstated but not entirely unearned) for petty crime. But it's also one of the most vital cities in Europe — a place that hasn't been gentrified into blandness, where the old ways persist, where the food is transcendent, and where you can touch history that isn't roped off in a museum. It's Italy at its most Italian, for better and for everything.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around from Naples</h3>
        <p>Ships dock at Stazione Marittima, within walking distance of the historic center. Naples offers multiple transportation options for both city exploration and regional excursions:</p>

        <h4>Public Transportation in Naples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Metro Line 1:</strong> The metro station sits close to the cruise terminal (inaugurated in 2015) with trains departing every 10 minutes to Piazza Garibaldi and beyond. Single tickets cost €1.50 — an affordable way to navigate the city.</li>
          <li><strong>Alibus (Airport Shuttle):</strong> Runs every 20 minutes connecting the cruise port with Naples Central Station and the airport, perfect for pre- or post-cruise transfers.</li>
          <li><strong>Naples Historic Center:</strong> 10–15 minute walk to Piazza del Plebiscito and Spaccanapoli (about the time it takes to eat one margherita pizza slice properly, or roughly three espresso stops at local cafés)</li>
          <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at the terminal, though be prepared for notorious Naples traffic. Agree on fare beforehand or ensure the meter is running.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Regional Day Trips</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pompeii (24 km):</strong> Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale (€3.90, 35 min), SITA bus route 5001 (approximately 45 minutes), or taxi/private tour €120–150. The ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is open daily from 8:30am to 7:30pm.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorrento (50 km):</strong> Circumvesuviana train (€4.20, ~70 min), or take a scenic fast ferry from Molo Beverello terminal (40-minute crossing, €12.30 one-way) for stunning bay views during your journey.</li>
          <li><strong>Capri & Ischia:</strong> Both islands are accessible via short ferry rides from Naples, offering beautiful Mediterranean escapes.</li>
          <li><strong>Amalfi Coast:</strong> Best done by ship excursion or private driver (€250–350). Not practical by public transport in a port day.</li>
          <li><strong>Vesuvius:</strong> The active volcano looms over the bay and can be reached via EAV bus from Pompeii Scavi station (€3.90) or included in many Pompeii tours</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Hop-On Hop-Off Bus:</strong> Tour buses pick up passengers about 5 minutes to the left of Castel Nuovo for a convenient overview of the city's highlights.</p>
        <p><strong>Safety Note:</strong> The Circumvesuviana is cheap but often crowded and can have pickpockets. Keep valuables secure. For comfort and time savings, a private driver to Pompeii is worthwhile.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Positively Framed Word of Warning</h3>
        <p>Naples rewards travelers who embrace its energy and stay alert. The city is famously chaotic — traffic, crowds, and enthusiastic vendors are part of the experience. Keep valuables secured (money belt, zipped bags) and don't leave belongings in rental cars. That said, violent crime against tourists is rare; most issues are opportunistic pickpocketing in crowded areas. Stay aware, don't flash expensive items, and you'll be fine. The overwhelming majority of Neapolitans are warm, proud people who want you to love their city — and you will.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Cruise Terminal & Arrival</h3>
        <p>Your ship arrives at Stazione Marittima, conveniently located in the heart of downtown Naples. The port terminal is well-equipped with essential services including ATMs for cash withdrawals, dining options if you need a quick bite, a tourist information desk to help plan your day, and public restrooms. The historic city center is just a short 10-minute stroll from where you disembark, making Naples one of the more accessible Mediterranean ports for independent exploration.</p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before leaving the terminal, grab a map from the tourist info desk and consider withdrawing some euros from the ATM — many local establishments still prefer cash, especially the traditional pizzerias.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Shopping & Dining Districts</h3>
        <p>Naples, the city that gave pizza to the world, offers exceptional food and shopping experiences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Via Chiaia:</strong> This pedestrian-only boulevard is ideal for leisurely shopping, featuring both international brands and local boutiques.</li>
          <li><strong>Galleria Umberto I:</strong> A stunning covered shopping arcade built in the late 19th century with elegant architecture and upscale shops.</li>
          <li><strong>Via Riviera di Chiaia:</strong> The waterfront promenade lined with charming cafés — perfect for a coffee break while watching the bay.</li>
          <li><strong>Pizza Heritage:</strong> Remember, you're in the birthplace of pizza! This is where the iconic Margherita was created. Eating authentic Neapolitan pizza here isn't just lunch — it's a culinary pilgrimage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Practical Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (EUR). ATMs widely available; credit cards accepted at most restaurants and shops, though cash is king at traditional establishments.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency Number:</strong> Dial 112 for all emergency services (police, medical, fire).</li>
          <li><strong>WiFi Access:</strong> Free wireless internet is available at many cafés near the railway station and throughout the city center.</li>
          <li><strong>Shop Hours:</strong> Traditional Italian schedule — most shops open 8am-1pm, close for siesta, then reopen 4pm-7pm. Many close completely on Sundays.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Reminder:</strong> Keep a close eye on your belongings, especially in crowded tourist areas, markets, and on public transportation. Pickpocketing does occur, though it's easily avoided with basic awareness.</li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Should I book a ship excursion or go independently?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">For Pompeii, independent is easy and cheaper. For the Amalfi Coast, ship excursions or private drivers are better — the roads are difficult and distances deceiving. Ship excursions guarantee you won't miss the ship.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How much time do I need at Pompeii?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Minimum 2–3 hours for highlights, 4–5 hours to see most of it properly. The site is massive (163 acres). Wear comfortable shoes and bring water — there's little shade.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Can I do both Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">It's possible but extremely rushed — you'd get snapshots of each rather than real experiences. Most people choose one. If it's your only visit, Pompeii is often recommended as harder to replicate elsewhere.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Where should I eat pizza?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The historic pizzerias are Da Michele (famous from "Eat Pray Love," expect lines), Sorbillo, and Di Matteo. Any place on Via dei Tribunali with locals eating is a safe bet. Expect to pay €4–8 for a pizza.</p>

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Naples is the gateway to Pompeii (30 min), the Amalfi Coast, and Sorrento. The city itself offers world-class pizza, the National Archaeological Museum, and authentic Italian chaos. Ships dock at Stazione Marittima, near the historic center.
