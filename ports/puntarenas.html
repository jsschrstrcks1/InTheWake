        <h1>Puntarenas: Where Rainforest Meets the Pacific</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Costa Rica embodies the concept of "Pura Vida" — pure life — with an intensity that transforms a simple phrase into a national philosophy. This tiny Central American nation abolished its military in 1949 and reinvested those resources into education, healthcare, and environmental protection. Today, Costa Rica protects over 25% of its territory as national parks and reserves, hosting 5% of the world's biodiversity in a landmass smaller than West Virginia. Puntarenas, on the Pacific coast, serves as the cruise gateway to this eco-tourism paradise — a jumping-off point for rainforests, cloud forests, wildlife sanctuaries, and adventures that range from contemplative nature walks to heart-pounding zip-line flights through the canopy.</p>

          <p>The first time I stood beneath the ceiba trees in Carara National Park, scarlet macaws erupted overhead in brilliant red-and-blue flashes, their raucous calls echoing through the forest. These spectacular parrots — up to 35 inches long with wingspans reaching three feet — mate for life and return to Carara's lowland rainforest each evening to roost. Watching them land in the treetops at sunset, couples preening each other's feathers, you understand why Costa Rica fiercely protects these habitats. The park sits at the ecological transition zone between dry forest and humid rainforest, creating extraordinary biodiversity: poison dart frogs, Jesus Christ lizards that run across water, crocodiles sunning on riverbanks, and over 400 bird species in just 13,000 acres.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Holding a three-toed sloth at a rescue sanctuary near Puntarenas. Her name was Esperanza — Hope. She'd been electrocuted on power lines and lost the use of her left arm. The sanctuary rehabilitated her, and she gripped my shoulder with her remaining claws, blinking slowly with that characteristic sloth serenity. The guide explained that sloths' slow metabolism means they defecate only once a week, always descending from trees to the forest floor — where they're most vulnerable to predators. Everything about sloths defies logic. Yet they've survived for millions of years. Pura Vida, indeed.
          </div>

          <p>Puntarenas itself is a modest working port — a narrow peninsula jutting into the Nicoya Gulf, historically a coffee export hub. Don't expect colonial architecture or cosmopolitan dining. The town's charm lies in its authenticity: fishing boats, local sodas (small family restaurants), schoolchildren in uniforms, and a Paseo de los Turistas waterfront promenade where Ticos (Costa Ricans) spend weekend evenings. But honestly, you're not here for Puntarenas town. You're here for the rainforests, the wildlife, the rivers, the zip-lines, and the overwhelming green intensity of Costa Rica's natural wonders. Book a tour. Get into the jungle. Experience what this remarkable country has spent decades protecting.</p>

          <p>Multiple sanctuaries near Puntarenas rehabilitate injured sloths, monkeys, birds. Guided tours with close wildlife encounters, education about conservation. See two-toed and three-toed sloths, rescued macaws, capuchin monkeys. 30-min from port. Half-day tour. ~$50-80. Perfect for families. Supporting these sanctuaries funds vital wildlife rescue work.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Manuel Antonio National Park</h4>
          <p>Costa Rica's most famous park — pristine beaches meeting rainforest. White-sand coves, hiking trails, howler monkeys, sloths, iguanas, incredible biodiversity. 2-hour drive from port. Full-day tour essential. ~$25 entry + tour costs. Worth the early start. Combine wildlife viewing with beach time. Bring swimsuit, towel, reef-safe sunscreen.</p>

Hanging bridges, hummingbird gardens, quetzal sightings (dry season), unique orchids and epiphytes. 3-hour drive from port. Full-day excursion. ~$100+ tours. Cooler temperatures at elevation — bring light jacket. Otherworldly ecosystem unlike typical rainforest.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tárcoles River Crocodile Safari</h4>
          <p>Boat tour on Tárcoles River to see massive American crocodiles (some over 15 feet long) basking on muddy banks. Excellent birding (roseate spoonbills, herons, kingfishers). Near Carara National Park. Half-day tour. ~$60-80. Safe viewing from boat. Best in morning when crocs sun themselves. Thrilling yet educational.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Coffee Plantation Tours</h4>
          <p>Costa Rica produces some of the world's finest Arabica coffee. Plantation tours show bean cultivation, harvesting, roasting processes. Tastings included. Learn about shade-grown, sustainable practices. Near Puntarenas. Half-day. ~$50-70. Great for coffee enthusiasts. Purchase fresh-roasted beans to bring home.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Puntarenas Town & Beach Walk</h4>
          <p>If staying near port: walk the Paseo de los Turistas waterfront promenade, visit local sodas for authentic casado lunch, explore fishing docks, relax on gray-sand beaches.

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Book rainforest tours in advance — Carara and Manuel Antonio have daily visitor limits</li>
            <li>Wear closed-toe shoes for jungle trails; sandals inadequate for muddy, uneven terrain</li>
            <li>Bug spray essential (DEET-based recommended); rainforests teem with mosquitoes</li>
            <li>Bring binoculars for wildlife viewing — sloths and monkeys high in canopy difficult to see unaided</li>
            <li>Reef-safe sunscreen required at beaches and national parks (protects coral reefs)</li>
            <li>US dollars accepted most places; small denominations helpful for tips and small purchases</li>
            <li>Light rain jacket useful even in dry season — afternoon showers common</li>
            <li>Camera with good zoom essential for wildlife photography</li>
            <li>Respect wildlife — no touching, feeding, or flash photography (except at sanctuaries with guide permission)</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated — tropical heat and humidity intense, especially on active tours</li>
            <li>Learn basic Spanish greetings — "Pura Vida" works as hello, goodbye, thank you, and general enthusiasm</li>
            <li>Allow extra time returning to tender — Puerto Caldera can have tender lines at all-aboard time</li>
          </ul>
