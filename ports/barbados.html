        <h1>Barbados: Where Caribbean Soul Runs Deeper Than the Rum</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Barbados announced itself before we even docked — the scent of salt air mixing with something sweet (was that sugarcane?) as our ship approached the Bridgetown harbor. This easternmost Caribbean island has been welcoming sailors since 1625, when the British first claimed it, beginning what would become one of the Caribbean's most stable colonial relationships. For 341 years, until independence in 1966, Barbados remained under continuous British rule — longer than almost any other Caribbean territory. You can feel that history in every chattel house, every coral stone church, every raised glass of Mount Gay rum.</p>

          <p>Here's something that struck me standing at the port: George Washington once stood on this same island in 1751, at age nineteen. It remains the only foreign country the first American president ever visited. He came for his ailing half-brother's health, stayed two months, and caught smallpox — the immunity from which may have saved his life during the Revolutionary War. History runs deep here, in ways you don't expect.</p>

          <p>What struck me immediately was how different Barbados feels from the rest of the Caribbean. The British influence runs deep — they drive on the left, cricket is a religion, and afternoon tea is a genuine thing. They call it "Little England," and the nickname fits more than you'd think. But underneath that colonial veneer beats an unmistakably Bajan heart: the rhythms of calypso and soca, the fire of pepper sauce on flying fish, the warmth of strangers who call you "love" and actually seem to mean it. It's this blend — 400 years of British formality married to Caribbean soul — that makes Barbados feel unlike anywhere else in the region.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Floating in the impossibly clear water of Carlisle Bay, snorkeling over the Berwyn shipwreck while sea turtles glided past like they owned the place (they do). I'd paid nothing beyond a taxi ride and mask rental. Sometimes the best Caribbean moments don't require an excursion booking — just a willingness to get in the water and see what shows up.
          </div>

          <p>Harrison's Cave exceeded my expectations. I'd braced for a touristy underground train ride through mediocre formations. Instead, we descended into a genuinely spectacular crystallized limestone cavern — waterfalls, pools, stalactites that took millions of years to form. The tram makes it accessible without requiring a spelunking adventure. Worth the drive into the island's interior.</p>

          <p>But let's talk about rum, because you simply cannot understand Barbados without understanding its relationship with the spirit. Mount Gay, founded in 1703, holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating rum distillery in the Caribbean — possibly the world. The distillery tour taught me something I'd never known: in 1645, a Royal Navy edict began the tradition of the daily rum ration for sailors, a practice that continued for over 300 years until "Black Tot Day" in 1970. Barbados didn't just produce rum; it fueled the entire British Navy's liquid courage.</p>

          <p>The island is also credited as the birthplace of rum punch — that perfect balance of "one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak" that every Caribbean bartender knows. Today, Barbados has over 1,500 rum shops scattered across its 166 square miles. That's roughly one rum shop for every 190 residents. These aren't touristy beach bars; they're corner establishments where locals gather, talk cricket, and pour generous measures. I stopped into one near Speightstown, paid $3 BBD for a rum and coconut water, and left understanding why Bajans take their rum culture seriously.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Bridgetown Cruise Terminal — modern facility with shops, ATMs, and taxi stand</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Beach:</strong> Carlisle Bay is 10 min by taxi; west coast beaches 30-45 min</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock directly at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Barbados Dollar (BBD) pegged 2:1 to USD; US dollars widely accepted</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> English (with delightful Bajan dialect)</li>

            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> December–April (dry season); hurricane season June–November</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Carlisle Bay</h4>
          <p>The closest quality beach to the port (10 min taxi). Calm, clear water; several shipwrecks for snorkeling; sea turtles; beach chair rentals available. The perfect default if you just want Caribbean beach time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Harrison's Cave</h4>
          <p>Spectacular underground cave system with an electric tram tour. Stalactites, waterfalls, pools. About 45 min from port. ~$35 per person. Book ahead in high season.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mount Gay Rum Distillery</h4>
          <p>The Caribbean's oldest rum distillery, documented since 1703. Tours explain the distillation process, the history of the Royal Navy rum ration tradition (begun 1645), and include generous tastings. The signature tour is about $20; premium experiences available. 15 min from port. This is where Caribbean rum culture began.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011. The capital preserves one of the Caribbean's finest examples of British colonial architecture spanning the 17th to 19th centuries. Walk from the cruise terminal to see Parliament Buildings (dating to 1639), the Careenage (inner harbor where wooden sailing ships once careened for repairs), the Garrison Savannah (historic British military complex), and Broad Street shopping. The Garrison area includes a UNESCO-protected collection of historic military buildings, including the Main Guard and the George Washington House where the future president stayed in 1751.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">St Nicholas Abbey</h4>
          <p>Built in 1658, this Jacobean plantation house is one of only three remaining Jacobean mansions in the entire Western Hemisphere. The coral stone great house has been meticulously preserved, complete with Dutch gables and mullioned windows. Tours include the working rum distillery (they still make rum using traditional methods), heritage railway rides through the cane fields, and screenings of 1930s home movies shot by the Warren family. About 45 min from port. ~$30 per person. An architectural and historical treasure.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">West Coast Beaches</h4>
          <p>Mullins Beach and Paynes Bay offer calmer water and upscale beach bars. Further from port (30-45 min) but worth it for a premium beach day.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Oistins Fish Fry</h4>
          <p>Friday and Saturday night tradition — grilled fish, cold Banks beer, live music, dancing. If your ship is in port late, don't miss it. Most authentic local experience on the island.</p>

            <li><strong>Macaroni Pie:</strong> Bajan mac and cheese — a side dish staple at every meal</li>
            <li><strong>Banks Beer:</strong> The local lager, best ice-cold on the beach</li>
            <li><strong>Rum Punch:</strong> Barbados claims to be the birthplace of rum punch. The traditional recipe: "one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak." Every bar has their own take; Mount Gay rum is the gold standard base. Over 1,500 rum shops across the island serve it.</li>
            <li><strong>Pepper Sauce:</strong> Bajan pepper sauce is HOT — taste cautiously before dousing</li>
