      "markdown": "**Seabourn Encore launched in 2016 as Seabourn's first larger ship—600 guests versus the Odyssey Class's 458—testing whether the brand could scale without sacrificing intimacy.**\n\nThe expansion proved deliberate. Encore added capacity but also added space: more deck area per guest, more dining options, larger spa facilities. The ship grew guests and amenities proportionally.\n\n[Seabourn Ovation](/ships/seabourn/seabourn-ovation.html) followed in 2018 with identical design, validating the Encore Class approach. The pair now serves as Seabourn's primary conventional cruise vessels.\n\nDesign collaboration with hospitality designer Adam D. Tihany brought fresh perspective. Public spaces feel residential rather than nautical. The aesthetic positions Encore as boutique hotel that happens to sail.\n\nFor fleet context: Encore represents Seabourn's careful growth—larger capacity that expanded rather than diluted the intimate experience. The balance defines the Encore Class.",

Reservations fill quickly—book early.\n\nThe Colonnade transforms from breakfast buffet to evening restaurant featuring global cuisines. The versatility provides variety without requiring specialty restaurant supplements.\n\nSushi awaits at Sushi restaurant. Earth & Ocean Café offers casual pool deck options.

      "markdown": "**I booked my first solo cruise at fifty-three, recently divorced and terrified of eating alone in restaurants.**\n\nThe fear felt absurd for a woman who had managed corporate teams for decades. But there I was, standing outside The Restaurant on the first evening, frozen by the prospect of requesting a table for one. A staff member named Elena noticed me hovering near the entrance. Without making me feel observed, she approached warmly and asked if I might enjoy joining a table of fellow travelers she thought I would find interesting.\n\nThat simple act of noticing—of genuine hospitality rather than transactional service—changed everything about my voyage.\n\nElena had seated me with Margaret, a retired professor from Edinburgh, and David, a widowed architect from Melbourne. We became inseparable. Breakfast together in The Colonnade. Afternoon tea in the Observation Bar. Dinners that stretched into philosophical conversations none of us had enjoyed in years.\n\nMy butler, Thomas, learned my rhythms quickly. He noticed I returned to my Veranda Suite exhausted after social evenings but energized after quiet afternoons reading on my private veranda. Without my asking, he began leaving a pot of chamomile tea waiting after dinner gatherings, and ensuring the afternoon turndown included fresh coffee and the international newspapers I favored.\n\nThe crisis came mid-voyage when I received news that my mother had been hospitalized back home. I was thousands of miles away, panicked, unable to think clearly about whether to disembark at the next port. The ship's guest services team—alerted somehow by Thomas—arranged an immediate satellite call to my mother's doctor. They researched flight options from our next three ports. They offered to hold a suite on the return voyage at no additional charge if I needed to leave.\n\nI stayed. My mother insisted. But the crew's response in that moment of terror showed me what all-inclusive truly means on Seabourn. It means being held by people who notice when you're struggling.\n\nI have traveled solo on Encore twice more since that first voyage. Each time, Elena greets me by name. Each time, Thomas remembers exactly how I take my morning coffee. I no longer fear dining alone. On Seabourn Encore, I discovered that solo doesn't mean solitary—it means freedom to find your people on your own terms.",

      "markdown": "**My grandmother turned ninety at sea, surrounded by four generations of women who loved her.**\n\nPlanning the voyage had been complicated. Grandma used a wheelchair for longer distances. My mother, at sixty-eight, tired easily after her knee replacement. My teenage daughter declared she would die of boredom without WiFi. My six-year-old needed constant supervision near water. The logistics seemed impossible until our butler, Antonio, took charge.\n\nHe learned each of our needs during the first day. For Grandma, he arranged a wheelchair-accessible table in The Restaurant with extra space for her mobility aide. For my mother, he coordinated with the spa to schedule gentle water therapy sessions that eased her joint pain. For my sulking teenager, he somehow discovered that the ship's photography officer would mentor interested guests—and my daughter spent the voyage learning to shoot portraits, her phone forgotten.\n\nFor my six-year-old, Antonio performed daily magic. Treasure hunts with chocolate coins hidden in our connecting Veranda Suites. Special arrangements with the galley for her favorite foods. A visit to the bridge where the captain let her hold the ship's wheel.\n\nThe crisis arrived on Grandma's birthday. We had planned a private dinner in The Grill by Thomas Keller—reservations made months in advance. That morning, Grandma developed a fever. The ship's doctor diagnosed a minor infection, treatable but exhausting. She couldn't possibly manage the restaurant.\n\nI was devastated. This was meant to be her moment. We had flown from four different cities to celebrate her.\n\nAntonio knocked on our suite door at five o'clock. Behind him stood two servers carrying linens, crystal, silver, and flowers. They transformed Grandma's suite into a private dining room. The Grill's executive chef sent every course we had ordered, adapted for bedside service. The sommelier brought the champagne we had selected. Even the restaurant's signature tableside preparations happened in that suite.\n\nGrandma sat propped against pillows in her silk robe, laughing at her great-granddaughter's jokes, watching her daughter and granddaughter finally relaxed after months of planning stress. When the birthday cake arrived—a recreation of her wedding cake from 1956, based on a photograph my mother had secretly provided—she wept.\n\nWe all did.\n\nSeabourn didn't just accommodate our complicated family. They understood that the accommodation was the point. That making space for a ninety-year-old woman to feel celebrated, despite everything, was what ultra-luxury actually means.",

      "markdown": "**We almost cancelled our honeymoon three days before departure when my husband tested positive for COVID.**\n\nThe wedding had been perfect after two years of pandemic postponements. The Seabourn Encore cruise—two weeks through the Mediterranean—represented everything we had dreamed about during lockdowns. When Michael's test came back positive, I sat on our bathroom floor and sobbed.\n\nSeabourn's response changed everything. Their guest services team called within hours of our cancellation request. They didn't just offer to rebook—they rebuilt our entire voyage. A later departure date on the same ship. The same Penthouse Suite we had originally booked. Complimentary upgrade to include a private car transfer to the port. No fees, no complications, no stress.\n\nWhen we finally boarded Encore three weeks later, our butler Sophia was waiting with champagne and a handwritten card from the captain congratulating us on our marriage. She had been briefed on our story. She understood this voyage carried extra emotional weight.\n\nSophia orchestrated small romantic gestures throughout the cruise. Rose petals on the bed for our one-month anniversary. A private table on our veranda for breakfast, set with flowers that matched my wedding bouquet. Reservations at The Grill perfectly timed to watch the sunset over Santorini.\n\nThe most meaningful moment came in Dubrovnik. Michael had secretly arranged a vow renewal ceremony through the ship—but the officiant fell ill the morning of. I found him in our suite, phone in hand, trying to salvage his surprise while pretending nothing was wrong.\n\nSophia noticed his distress. Within two hours, she had located an English-speaking local officiant, secured permissions for a ceremony at a medieval church overlooking the harbor, and arranged for the ship's florist to create a small bouquet. She even coordinated with The Colonnade to pack an elegant picnic for afterward.\n\nWe renewed our vows on a cliff above the Adriatic, just the two of us and an ancient stone church. The ship's photographer captured images we will treasure forever. That evening, the restaurant staff had somehow decorated our usual table with the same flowers from the ceremony.\n\nOur honeymoon wasn't perfect. It was better—it taught us that marriage means adapting together, and that the right support transforms obstacles into memories. Seabourn Encore didn't just host our honeymoon. They helped begin our marriage.",

      "markdown": "**My wife and I worked for forty-three years to afford a vacation like this.**\n\nI drove a delivery truck. Martha taught elementary school. We raised three kids in a small house in Ohio and never once flew first class. When I retired at sixty-seven, Martha handed me a Seabourn brochure and said it was time to finally treat ourselves.\n\nI was terrified we wouldn't belong.\n\nEverything about Seabourn Encore seemed designed for sophisticated travelers who knew which fork to use and how to pronounce French wines. We were meat-and-potatoes people from Toledo. I worried the crew would see through us immediately.\n\nOur butler, Gregory, eliminated that fear within hours. He didn't treat us like rubes to be educated or wealthy guests to be flattered. He treated us like interesting people whose preferences mattered. When I admitted I didn't understand the wine list, he didn't condescend—he asked what flavors I enjoyed with dinner and made recommendations that matched. When Martha mentioned she struggled with stairs, he quietly arranged for us to always use elevators and reserved tables in The Restaurant that didn't require navigating steps.\n\nThe health scare came on day four. I woke at three in the morning with chest pains. Martha panicked. So did I—my father died of a heart attack at sixty-two, and I was sixty-seven with no doctor for thousands of miles.\n\nThe ship's medical team responded within minutes of Martha's call. Dr. Andersen—a cardiologist who happened to be the ship's physician—ran an EKG in our suite. Severe indigestion, not cardiac. But he didn't dismiss my fear. He sat with us for an hour, explaining the results, showing me exactly why he was confident, arranging follow-up monitoring for the rest of the voyage.\n\nGregory appeared the next morning with chamomile tea, bland toast, and a gentle schedule of activities that wouldn't tax my still-nervous system. He had coordinated with the medical team and the spa to suggest treatments that would help me relax. That afternoon, Martha and I sat in the spa's thermal suite, holding hands, watching the Mediterranean slide past, and I realized I had never felt so cared for in my adult life.\n\nWe have cruised on Encore three times since. Each voyage, Gregory requests to be our butler. Each voyage, he remembers that I prefer whiskey to wine and that Martha loves the lemon tart from The Colonnade. We worked hard our whole lives. Seabourn Encore reminds us we earned this.",

From booking confirmation to memorial service took four months. The Seabourn voyage sat in my email like a wound—proof of the future we had planned together, now impossible.\n\nMy daughter convinced me to go anyway. Robert would have wanted it, she said. I didn't believe her, but I went.\n\nI boarded Seabourn Encore clutching Robert's ashes in a small urn, feeling like a ghost haunting the vacation he should have taken. My butler, Emmanuel, noticed immediately that I was not a joyful traveler. He didn't pry. He simply created space for whatever I needed.\n\nThe first three days, I barely left my Veranda Suite. Emmanuel brought meals I didn't order but somehow wanted. He made sure the suite was always fresh but never disturbed my privacy. He left small touches—a single flower, a handwritten note about the day's weather—that reminded me life continued without demanding I participate.\n\nOn the fourth day, I ventured to The Colonnade for breakfast. A woman my age sat alone at the next table. We nodded politely. By lunch, we were talking. By dinner, I had learned that Susan had lost her husband two years before and had cruised alone ever since.\n\n\"The sea holds grief well,\" she told me. \"There's enough space out there for all of it.\"\n\nEmmanuel noticed our friendship forming. He began seating us together without being asked. He coordinated with the spa to book us adjacent treatment rooms. He arranged for a private table on the deck where Susan and I could watch sunsets and talk about the men we had loved.\n\nThe turning point came in Barcelona. I had mentioned to Emmanuel that Robert had always wanted to see La Sagrada Familia. That morning, a private tour awaited me—just me and a guide who spent four hours showing me the cathedral Robert had dreamed about.\n\nI scattered some of his ashes in the Mediterranean that evening, from my veranda, as the sun set over the water. Emmanuel had placed a single rose and a glass of Robert's favorite whiskey beside me. He never said a word. He simply knew.\n\nI have cruised three times since, always on Encore when possible. Emmanuel still requests me as his guest. The grief has softened into gratitude. Robert never saw the ship, but somehow, through Seabourn's care, I carry him with me on every voyage.",

      "markdown": "**I lost the use of my legs in a car accident at thirty-four. At forty-two, I discovered that Seabourn doesn't see my wheelchair—they see me.**\n\nMost travel as a wheelchair user involves constant advocacy. Fighting for accessible rooms that turn out to have barriers. Negotiating with staff who see disability before personhood. Accepting that adventure means compromise.\n\nSeabourn Encore operated differently from the moment I boarded.\n\nMy butler, Dimitri, had clearly been briefed on my needs, but he led with curiosity about my preferences rather than assumptions about my limitations. What did I enjoy? What had I found frustrating on past travels? What would make this voyage exceptional rather than merely accessible?\n\nThe Veranda Suite designated as accessible exceeded expectations. Roll-in shower with proper grab bars. Lowered closet rods I could actually reach. A veranda with enough space for my chair and room to transfer to a lounge chair for sunbathing. These weren't afterthoughts—they were designed.\n\nThe crisis came during a shore excursion in Monte Carlo. The accessible tour I had booked turned out to use a vehicle that couldn't actually accommodate my wheelchair—a vendor error, not Seabourn's. I sat on the pier watching my group leave without me, fighting tears of frustration I thought I had outgrown years ago.\n\nDimitri had accompanied the group to ensure I was settled. When he saw what happened, he didn't apologize uselessly or offer platitudes. He pulled out his phone, made three calls, and within thirty minutes had arranged a private accessible vehicle and a local guide who specialized in mobility-accessible tours.\n\nI saw more of Monaco that day than the original group. My guide knew every elevator, every accessible entrance, every restaurant with step-free access. We had lunch at a café overlooking the harbor that the walking tour couldn't have reached.\n\nThat evening, Seabourn's hotel director personally apologized and informed me that the shore excursion vendor had been contacted about the error. My excursion cost was refunded—though I would have paid double for the experience I actually received.\n\nThe Colonnade's breakfast stations were all reachable from my chair. The Spa accommodated my transfers onto treatment tables with practiced ease. The Grill's staff moved tables without fuss to create space for my wheelchair. Every interaction assumed competence and welcomed presence.\n\nSeabourn Encore didn't accommodate my disability. They included me completely. There is a difference, and once you experience it, you never accept less.",
