    <article class="card"><h1>Kailua-Kona: Coffee and Mantas</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>We tendered into Kailua Pier just after sunrise, the ship floating in that impossibly blue water behind us. This is the main town on the west Kona coast, and within minutes of stepping ashore you feel the rhythm of an old Hawaiian fishing village that never quite forgot itself despite the cruise ships and coffee tours. The tender process was smooth – lines move fast here – and by 8:30 we were walking Aliʻi Drive in that perfect morning light before the heat settled in.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/kona/kona-1.webp" alt="Kona harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Kona — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Kona&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>Huliheʻe Palace opens at 9, and we had the place nearly to ourselves – koa-wood floors, portraits of Hawaiian royalty, the quiet dignity of a vacation residence built in 1838 when these islands still had a king and queen. Standing in those rooms you can almost hear the ocean through the windows the way they must have heard it. After the palace we joined a coffee farm tour that left at 10 a.m., driving fifteen minutes south into the hills above town where the famous Kona coffee belt stretches along the volcanic slopes.</p>

        <p>The guide told us the story I'd read but never truly understood: in 1828, Reverend Samuel Ruggles brought the first coffee plants here from Brazil, and they found a kind of paradise. The microclimate is what makes it magic – morning sun to ripen the cherries, afternoon clouds to cool them, volcanic soil so rich you can smell the minerality in the dirt. We walked between rows of coffee trees, tasted ripe cherries straight from the branch (sweet pulp around the bean), and brought home a bag that still fills the kitchen with that unmistakable Kona aroma months later.</p>

        <p>The afternoon we simply wandered the village – snorkeled off the pier at Kamakahonu Beach where green sea turtles graze the rocks like underwater cattle, ate poke nachos at Umekes watching the Ironman buoys bob in the bay. But the real reason most people come to Kona, the experience that shows up in every forum and every guide and every breathless conversation at the ship's pool bar the next morning, is the night manta ray snorkel.</p>

        <p>Boats leave right from the pier area around 5:30 to 6 p.m., and you're back by 8:30 or 9 p.m. with hours to spare before all-aboard. They take you a short distance offshore, give you a wetsuit and flotation board, and then you wait in the dark water while underwater lights draw plankton – and the plankton draws the mantas. These are gentle giants with wingspans of 12 to 16 feet, and they come to feed in slow, balletic loops that bring them within inches of your face. It's safe, it's heavily regulated, and it's one of those rare wildlife encounters that delivers exactly what was promised.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Lying face-down on a flotation board in complete darkness, the only light coming from below, watching a manta ray the size of a small car do slow-motion barrel rolls directly underneath me – mouth wide open, belly glowing white in the lights, filtering plankton as it passed so close I could have touched it. Zero fear. Pure wonder. The kind of moment that makes you believe in magic again.

        <h3>Getting Around Kailua-Kona</h3>
        <p><strong>Tender Service:</strong> Ships anchor in the bay and use tenders to shuttle passengers directly to Kailua Pier in the heart of town. The process is efficient and brings you right to the center of the action.</p>

        <p><strong>On Foot:</strong> The historic Kailua village is compact and best explored by walking. Ali'i Drive and the surrounding streets are pleasant for strolling.</p>

        <p><strong>Complimentary Transit:</strong> A free trolley service operates from the pier, making a circuit through town, shopping areas, and beaches – the full loop takes about an hour and passes by the Outrigger hotel. Additionally, the island's public bus system is free on all routes, making it easy to venture beyond the immediate area.</p>

        <p><strong>Car Rentals:</strong> If you prefer your own wheels, several national agencies including Enterprise, Thrifty, and Dollar have locations near the pier for easy pickup.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>What to See & Do</h3>
        <p><strong>Snorkeling:</strong> Two outstanding spots draw underwater enthusiasts – Kahaluu Bay offers easy access and abundant marine life, while Kealakekua Bay is renowned for its crystal-clear waters and dramatic underwater landscapes.</p>

        <p><strong>Beach Time:</strong> Magic Sands Beach lives up to its name with brilliant white sand that sometimes disappears with seasonal tides – a local phenomenon worth witnessing.</p>

        <p><strong>Cultural Sites:</strong> Ali'i Drive is lined with historic landmarks telling the story of Hawaiian royalty and early settlement. Nearby, you can find ancient petroglyphs carved into lava rock, offering a glimpse into pre-contact Hawaii.</p>

        <p><strong>Volcano Experience:</strong> Weather permitting, views of Kilauea can be spectacular from certain vantage points around the island.</p>

        <p><strong>Evening Ritual:</strong> Join locals and visitors along the seawall to watch the sun sink into the Pacific – a daily spectacle that never gets old.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Shopping & Services</h3>
        <p><strong>Farmer's Market:</strong> Open Wednesday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., featuring fresh produce, local crafts, and island specialties.</p>

        <p><strong>Kona Coffee:</strong> You're in the heart of coffee country – authentic Kona beans make excellent gifts and are available throughout town. Long's Pharmacy stocks locally-roasted varieties at reasonable prices.</p>

        <p><strong>Major Retailers:</strong> For everyday needs or forgotten items, Target and other familiar chains are within reach of the port area.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p><strong>Tendering:</strong> Tender ports always have the chance of swells – the Kona tenders are well-practiced and the process rarely delays the day.</p>

        <p><strong>Money Matters:</strong> U.S. dollars are the currency (Hawaii is a U.S. state). ATMs are readily available throughout town. Standard American tipping applies: 15-20% at restaurants, 10-15% for services like taxis and tour guides.</p>

        <p><strong>Weather:</strong> The Kona coast enjoys sunshine more than 300 days a year with minimal rainfall – sunscreen is essential, umbrellas usually aren't.</p>

        <p><strong>Emergency Contact:</strong> Dial 911 for any emergency services (police, fire, medical).</p>
