      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed *Radiance of the Seas*. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nWhen I stepped aboard in Vancouver, the cast boot around my ankle drew more attention than my smile. I’d sprained it three months earlier—nothing heroic, just a tumble on the school steps after chasing a seventh-grader who’d forgotten his trombone. But for a woman who lives by the bell schedule, being forced to slow down felt like punishment. The crew didn’t see it that way. From the first greeting—“Welcome home, Miss Harper”—to the way the stateroom attendant quietly left an extra ice pack in my mini-fridge, I was reminded that kindness moves faster than pain. One barista learned my order (“half-sweet mocha, extra patience”) by day two. The ship itself seemed to conspire in my healing.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nBoarding at Canada Place was smoother than my own stride. The pier staff guided me to the accessibility lane, and within twenty minutes I was leaning on the rail, watching seaplanes lift off like prayers over the harbor. Disembarkation in Seward a week later felt harder—not physically, but emotionally. There’s something about the final morning at sea, the slow rotation of the ship into the fjord light, that makes you realize the horizon was never the point. It was learning to look up again.\n\n## The Real Talk\nNot every moment was picture-perfect. There were times I caught my reflection in the elevator mirror and hated the limp. The jogging track mocked me. And yes, sometimes the Wi-Fi vanished like motivation on a Monday. But one evening near Hubbard Glacier, I sat alone on Deck 12 as the captain swung us broadside to the ice. The ship fell utterly silent—no announcements, no chatter—just the groan of ancient ice cracking open. A stranger, maybe late sixties, eased into the chair beside me. He didn’t offer a drink; he offered a story. Thirty years married, first cruise since his wife’s chemo ended. He said, “You never realize how loud healing is until you hear it echo.” We sat there in shared quiet until a chunk of ice calved and thundered into the sea. For the first time in months, I didn’t wince at the sound of breaking. I whispered, mostly to myself, “This is what grace sounds like.”\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nRadiance is one of the easier ships I’ve navigated—wide corridors, elevators at every turn, and crew who don’t treat accessibility like charity. The spa arranged a short-duration massage suited for limited mobility. Even tender ports like Icy Strait Point were managed with thoughtful ramps and steady hands. My favorite detail? Crew members never hovered—they simply appeared when needed, like well-timed commas in a long sentence.\n\n## A Female Crewmate’s Perspective\nOn day four, a housekeeper named Lila found me sketching glaciers in the Solarium. She sat down on break and said, “We all come to sea for something. Some to run, some to rest.” She told me she sends most of her paycheck home to Cebu and hasn’t seen her children in two years. Then she smiled: “But I still get to watch people heal.” There was no sermon in her words, yet I felt one forming in my chest. Grace again—steady, unspectacular, holy.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nBy the time we reached Seward, I no longer cared how fast I walked. I cared that I could stand on my own deck and breathe without rushing the view. Radiance didn’t cure me; it recalibrated me. It taught me that healing isn’t about getting back to normal—it’s about finding beauty in the limp. If you see a woman on the next sailing, camera in one hand and a slow step in the other, say hello. I might just tell you what grace sounds like in glacier light.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed *Radiance of the Seas*. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nI boarded Radiance in Tampa with more tension than luggage. Divorce papers finalized six months earlier, two kids back home with my sister, and a silence in my life I didn’t know how to fill. The crew seemed to notice without asking. My stateroom attendant, Dinesh, greeted me with a grin and a simple line: “You look like a man who needs the sea.” Each day he left a towel animal holding a note—quotes about rest, hope, and patience. By the third day, I started looking forward to them more than breakfast. At the bar, Eleni from Thessaloniki replaced my first order of whiskey with pineapple juice and winked: “Start soft, sir. You’ll taste more of life that way.” Somehow, she was right.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nTampa’s morning air was thick as memory when we sailed for Cozumel and Costa Maya—five nights in March 2025, a short loop through the Gulf. Boarding took less than half an hour, but emotionally it felt longer, like stepping out of the past one footprint at a time. Disembarkation was the opposite: too quick. When the port came back into view, I realized I wasn’t returning to the same shore I’d left.\n\n## The Real Talk\nDay two hit hard. Families surrounded me—matching shirts, inside jokes, small hands gripping soft-serve cones. Mine weren’t there. I almost retreated to my cabin, but a trivia host roped me into a team called “The Unsinkables.” We lost every round, but laughter filled the space that loneliness had carved out. On night four, the captain slowed us off Mexico’s coast for an at-sea stargazing event. I found myself beside an older couple celebrating fifty years married. The wife turned to me and said, “You know, son, healing doesn’t happen on calendars—it happens on waves.” Her words landed heavier than the warm night air. I watched her lean her head on her husband’s shoulder, and for the first time, I prayed—not for my marriage to come back, but for peace to stay.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nRadiance might be one of Royal’s smaller ships, but she’s big on compassion. I saw it in crew offering an arm to a man with a cane on the gangway, in the staff quietly clearing space for a wheelchair at trivia, in how the elevators never felt like an afterthought. Accessibility here isn’t just physical—it’s emotional. There’s room to breathe, to walk slowly, to be seen without being explained.\n\n## A Female Crewmate’s Perspective\nMid-voyage, I found Eleni again at the Schooner Bar. She told me she’d been at sea nine years, sending money home for her mother’s dialysis. “The ocean gives, but it also takes,” she said, stirring soda water with a straw. “Our job is to keep giving anyway.” I asked how she stayed hopeful. She smiled, tapping the counter: “Because every sunrise out here feels like a second chance.” I realized then that the ship’s glow at night wasn’t just lighting the waves—it was reflecting off people like her.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nWhen we docked back in Tampa, I didn’t rush off. I stood on Deck 12 until the last passenger left, breathing in the salt like I was learning to live again. Radiance didn’t erase my losses; she reframed them. She taught me that calm isn’t something you wait for—it’s something you choose, moment by moment. If you ever spot a dad standing alone at sunrise with coffee in one hand and gratitude in the other, that’s probably me, whispering thanks for a ship that taught me how to rest again.",

In **Skagway**, we did the **White Pass** train—she pressed her palm to the glass at the trestle and whispered, “Imagine building that.” In **Juneau**, we watched a whale sound and vanish like a shared secret.\n\n## Dining & Ease\nWe alternated **Main Dining** with **Chops Grille** (she called the filet “Sunday best”). Elevators were close, theater aisles forgiving. I pushed the pace only once and learned my lesson.\n\n## Tear-Tug\nAt **Ketchikan**, rain stitched the docks into a watercolor. Mom slipped her arm into mine and said, “Your dad would have teased this weather and loved it anyway.” We laughed and stood there in it.

       "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed *Radiance of the Seas*. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nI boarded in Vancouver with a backpack full of lenses and a calendar full of unfinished conversations. Burnout makes everything feel loud, even the quiet parts. The first person to lower the volume was Marlon, a stateroom attendant from Manila who noticed my camera and asked what I hoped to capture. I said, “Proof I can still see.” He nodded like that made sense and set an extra kettle in my room for evening tea. At Café Latte-tudes, Kahili from Oahu replaced my second espresso with a hot chocolate before I could protest—“Photographers shoot better on soft edges,” she said, sliding it across with a conspiratorial grin. Small mercies, early and often.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nCanada Place was all glass and promise on a late-June afternoon, gulls carving bright loops over the harbor. Check-in moved faster than my thoughts, and soon the Lions Gate Bridge framed our sailaway like a blessing I didn’t know I needed. A week later in Seward, the disembarkation line unfolded with that Sunday-evening feeling—orderly, reluctant, a little sacred. I walked onto the pier slower than I’d arrived, not because of crowds but because leaving felt like tearing a page from a journal mid-sentence.\n\n## The Real Talk\nNorthbound is a string of names that sound like exhale: Ketchikan, Icy Strait Point, Juneau, Skagway, Hubbard Glacier. But the mind doesn’t unclench on command. In Ketchikan I wandered Creek Street with my camera and still composed emails in my head. At Icy Strait Point, I stood by the shore while humpbacks fed in a tide line just beyond the pier, and my first instinct was to count how many photos I could capture before all-aboard. Burnout measures wonder in deliverables.\n\nThe break happened slowly, then all at once. In Juneau I rode the tram up Mount Roberts, found a boardwalk where the spruce smelled like rain, and met a kid—eight, maybe nine—holding his mom’s hand. He pointed past me and said, “Look, the mountain’s breathing.” Clouds lifted, and a slice of light found the channel below. I lowered the camera and just watched air turn visible. That night the captain lingered at Hubbard Glacier, the ship rotating until the ice filled every window like a cathedral wall. A woman near me whispered a prayer under her breath; I didn’t catch the words, only the cadence. When the glacier calved, it sounded like an organ’s low register, ancient and certain. I took one photo and then put the camera down. I counted my breaths instead. Somewhere between the echo and the hush, I realized I wasn’t trying to save time anymore. I was letting time save me.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nI came aboard able-bodied but watched Radiance make room for bodies unlike mine. Ramps at Icy Strait Point, crew steadying tender steps, theater seating that didn’t feel like an apology. Elevators never felt like detours—just another way to get where we were going. The lesson wasn’t subtle: welcome should be designed, not improvised. When I finally slowed down, I noticed how often the ship chose dignity first.\n\n## A Female Crewmate’s Perspective\nOn day five, during a quiet hour in the Schooner Bar, a server named Anya from Varna leaned on the rail and told me she paints between shifts—tiny watercolors of wake lines and moonlight. “People think the sea is blue,” she said, “but it’s mostly silver if you pay attention.” She slid her phone across the bar to show me a photo of her son back home learning to ride a bike. “I miss first times,” she admitted, “so I collect quiet seconds here.” It wasn’t a sermon, but it rearranged the furniture in my chest. We talk a lot about sacrifice in office language—deliverables, deadlines, sprints. Out here, sacrifice looked like a mother making beauty from borrowed minutes and still handing strangers their joy with a smile. I asked her how she keeps showing up. She tapped the bar twice and said, “I keep a short list of reasons.” I went back to my cabin and started mine.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nBy Skagway I was walking the promenade with pockets empty—no phone, no plan. I watched a father teach his daughter to frame mountains with her hands, thumbs touching like a viewfinder, and I remembered my own dad showing me constellations with the porch light off. On the last morning, Seward’s mountains were close enough to feel like counsel. I carried my bag down the gangway slowly because the world felt newly heavy and newly kind. Radiance didn’t hand me a different life; she gave me better language for the one I have—words like slower, truer, enough. If you see a guy on your sailing lingering by the rail at sunrise, camera at his side for once, that’ll be me—counting reasons, not hours, and letting the silver water keep the time."

Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## Intro\nA **Western Caribbean** itinerary from **Tampa** in **February 2024**: sea day → **Belize City** → **Roatán** → **Cozumel** → sea day. I brought travel brushes and left the to-do list at home.\n\n## Onboard Ease\n**Solarium** light for sketching, **Schooner Bar** for live piano and people studies, **Main Dining** for meals that arrived like punctuation marks.\n\n## Ashore\n**Belize**: river cruise where a guide pointed out manatees like old friends. **Roatán**: a beach with shade that understood knees. **Cozumel**: market colors I couldn’t finish painting.\n\n## Tear-Tug\nA pianist played “What a Wonderful World” as we sailed. A crew member noticed my sketchbook and asked to see. We both cried, then laughed at ourselves.\n\n## Practical Links\n• **Search Belize itineraries** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search  \n• **Packages & add-ons** → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/drink-packages.html  \n• **Packing: art-friendly** → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/packing-lists.html\n",
