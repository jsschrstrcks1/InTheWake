The pandemic took away his routines; virtual school took away his few friendships. By the time we boarded Encore, my son communicated only with me, my husband, and his therapist. Other humans were too unpredictable.\n\n[Galaxy Pavilion](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-encore.html) changed everything.\n\nNorwegian's VR arcade seemed like sensory overload waiting to happen. Flashing lights, sounds, crowds\u2014everything Marcus avoided. But his therapist had suggested 'contained novelty,' and Galaxy Pavilion delivered exactly that. Each VR pod was its own private world. Headset on, real world gone.\n\nMarcus found the racing simulator first. He played seventeen rounds, memorizing the track until he could navigate it blindfolded. The attendant, Miguel, noticed. 'You've got the best time today,' he said, speaking to Marcus's back since eye contact was impossible. 'Want to race someone for the record?'\n\nMarcus stiffened. I prepared to intervene. But Miguel had done this before. 'No pressure,' he added. 'The other racer won't be in your pod. You won't see them. Just two scores on a screen.'\n\nMarcus nodded. Almost imperceptibly, but a nod.\n\nThe other racer was a twelve-year-old named Jayden. For twenty minutes, they competed\u2014never meeting, never speaking, but connected through virtual roads and pixel cars. When Marcus won by 0.3 seconds, Jayden's voice came through the speaker: 'Good race, man!'\n\nMarcus paused. Then, clear as morning: 'Thanks. You almost got me on turn seven.'\n\nI burst into tears right there in Galaxy Pavilion. Miguel quietly handed me tissues.\n\n**The lesson:** Encore's Galaxy Pavilion isn't just entertainment\u2014it's parallel play for kids who struggle with direct interaction.",

No excuse.'\n\nThe first days I paced [The Waterfront](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-encore.html) like a man late for meetings that didn't exist. Couldn't sit still. Couldn't relax.

I wasn't supposed to be there\u2014I was sixty-five, childless, alone while my wife napped.

'Former teacher, by any chance?'\n\nI spent three hours with eight-year-olds teaching aerodynamics, physics, and why wings need lift. They called me 'Captain Ken' because principals and captains both run ships. By day's end, I'd helped a shy girl named Emma win first place with a modified dart design.\n\n'You should've seen her face,' I told my wife at dinner. 'Confidence. Pure confidence. Like she'd discovered she could do things.'\n\nMy wife smiled. 'Sounds like you discovered something too.'\n\nShe was right. Retirement didn't mean useless. It meant available. Available to mentor, to teach, to share forty-two years of wisdom with whoever needed it.\n\n**The truth:** Encore has space for purpose at every age.\n\nI volunteer at elementary schools now.

At least on a ship, we couldn't just walk away.\n\n[The Observation Lounge](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-encore.html) saved us.\n\nThis bar at the top of Encore has floor-to-ceiling windows facing the ocean.

The second night, he asked why. I couldn't answer\u2014not really. Loneliness. Validation. Reasons that sounded worse spoken aloud.\n\nNight three, he said something I didn't expect: 'I failed you too.'\n\nFor hours we talked about the distance we'd let grow. His workaholic patterns. My resentment. The slow erosion of us while we maintained the appearance of marriage. The affair was symptom, not source. We'd lost each other years before I made that choice.\n\nThe bartender, James, never interrupted. He'd quietly refill waters, leave snacks, disappear. Later I learned he'd been a marriage counselor before his career change. 'Sometimes people need space to fall apart,' he said. 'Ships provide that.'\n\nBy cruise end, we'd decided to try.
