HAL ships carrying this name honor both Dutch heritage and the American city that received millions of emigrants HAL transported.\n\nThe connection remains meaningful. Holland America built its reputation carrying passengers to New York. Ships named Nieuw Amsterdam reference that history, that relationship between Netherlands and America.\n\nWhen Nieuw Amsterdam V sails, she will carry this heritage into new waters and new eras—the latest link in a chain connecting 21st-century cruising to 17th-century Dutch colonialism.\n\nFor heritage appreciation: Nieuw Amsterdam V will embody the Dutch-American connection that defined HAL's founding mission. The name carries history wherever the ship sails.",
