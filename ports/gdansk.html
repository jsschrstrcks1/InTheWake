    <article class="card"><h1>Gdansk: My Phoenix City</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Our ship docked in Gdynia, not Gdańsk proper—a detail I'd missed in my planning. But this turned out to be a gift. Gdynia is part of Trójmiasto, the "Tri-city," strung along the Baltic coast like amber beads: industrial Gdynia where we berthed, resort Sopot in the middle, and historic Gdańsk at the southern end. The three cities flow together seamlessly, connected by commuter trains that run every fifteen minutes. I bought a ticket at the station and settled in for the thirty-five-minute journey south, watching apartment blocks give way to church spires as we rolled toward the Old Town.</p>

        <p>The train deposited me near the Golden Gate, that magnificent 17th-century Dutch Renaissance archway that marks the beginning of the Royal Route. I passed beneath its weathered stone and stepped onto Długi Targ—the Long Market—and my breath caught. The merchants' houses lining the cobblestones glowed in shades of rose, saffron, and mint, their ornate facades crowned with stepped gables. They looked as though they'd been standing since the Hanseatic League's golden age. But I knew the truth: nearly every building I was seeing had been rubble in 1945. Ninety-five percent of the Old Town was obliterated. What I was walking through was one of history's most painstaking reconstructions, each façade rebuilt from old photographs and engravings, each detail an act of memory and defiance.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/gdansk/gdansk-1.webp" alt="Gdansk harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Gdansk — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Gdansk&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>At the heart of the Long Market stands Neptune—a bronze god rising from his fountain, trident in hand, presiding over centuries of commerce and conversation. Cast in the 17th century, he's Gdańsk's guardian and symbol of its maritime soul. There's a local legend I love: Neptune once grew so angry at the revelry in the square that he struck the cobblestones with his trident, shattering gold coins and sending golden flakes swirling into the vodka. Thus was born Goldwasser, the shimmering liqueur still sold in shops around the square, tiny flecks of real gold leaf dancing in every bottle.</p>

        <p>I wandered into one of those shops—then another, then another—because Gdańsk calls itself the "World Capital of Amber," and it's no idle boast. Baltic gold gleams in every window: honey-colored teardrops, deep cognac cabochons, pieces with fossilized insects suspended mid-flight for forty million years. I bought a small pendant, warm in my palm, a piece of ancient sunlight to carry home.</p>

        <p>The Royal Route led me onward, past St. Mary's Church—one of the world's largest brick churches, its tower a 408-step climb I'll save for next time—and down to the Green Gate, the 16th-century waterfront palace that closes the ceremonial path. But the gate I needed to find was elsewhere. I asked directions to the European Solidarity Centre.</p>

        <p>The museum is built beside the Lenin Shipyard, on the very ground where history pivoted. In August 1980, electrician Lech Wałęsa climbed the shipyard fence and joined striking workers demanding rights and dignity. The Solidarity movement they forged became the first independent trade union in the Soviet Bloc. It grew into something larger than labor—a moral force that helped topple Communist rule in Poland and sent tremors through the Iron Curtain. Within a decade, the Berlin Wall had fallen. The Centre's exhibits trace that improbable arc: grainy photographs of men with mustaches and worn hands, homemade banners, the enormous monument to fallen workers rusting gently in the Baltic air.</p>

        <p>I stood there a long time, trying to hold the weight of it. This wasn't ancient history in a textbook. This was 1980—people my age, scared and stubborn, betting everything on the hope that the world could change. And it did.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

        <p>Back in the Old Town, I found a milk bar for a late lunch—pierogi ruskie and żurek soup served in a hollowed rye bread bowl, the kind of meal that tastes like a grandmother's hug. The waitress barely spoke English, but her smile needed no translation. I thought about the other history marker I'd passed earlier: a plaque near Westerplatte, where the first shots of World War II were fired on September 1, 1939. German forces attacked the Polish garrison there, and the world caught fire. Six years later, Gdańsk was ash and broken stone.</p>

        <p>Yet here I sat, warm soup in hand, surrounded by one of the richest complexes of architectural relics in Poland. Not relics, really—reconstructions. Every colorful gable, every carved doorway, every cobblestone was an argument against forgetting. The phoenix city had risen, and it was more beautiful than I'd imagined.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in the Gdańsk Shipyard beside the Solidarity monument, reading the names of workers who died in 1970, while an old man in a wool cap quietly told me, "We changed the world here." History wasn't a museum behind glass—it was still breathing, still alive in the people who carried it.

        <h3>Getting Around the Tri-City</h3>
        <p>Your cruise ship will dock in <strong>Gdynia</strong>, not Gdańsk itself—the port is about 10–15 miles north of the historic Old Town. But don't let that deter you. Gdynia is part of Trójmiasto (the Tri-city area), and getting to Gdańsk is wonderfully easy.</p>

        <p><strong>The Train:</strong> Commuter trains (SKM) run every 15 minutes between Gdynia Główna station and Gdańsk Główny station. The journey takes about 35 minutes and drops you within easy walking distance of the Old Town. Tickets are inexpensive and available from machines at the station (English option available). This is by far the most convenient and scenic option—you'll pass through Sopot, the beach resort town in between, and watch the Baltic coastline roll by.</p>

        <p><strong>Taxis and Ride-Shares:</strong> Available at the port, but expect a 30–40 minute drive depending on traffic, and the fare will be significantly higher than the train.</p>

        <p><strong>Shore Excursions:</strong> If you prefer a guided experience, ship excursions will handle transportation and often include the European Solidarity Centre, Old Town walking tour, and Oliwa Cathedral.</p>

        <p class="tiny" style="font-style: italic; color: #678; margin-top: 1rem;">Pro tip: Buy a day pass for the SKM trains if you want flexibility to hop between Gdynia, Sopot, and Gdańsk. Sopot's long wooden pier and beach promenade make a lovely mid-day break.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Does the ship dock in Gdańsk?</strong><br/>A: No, cruise ships dock in Gdynia, about 10–15 miles north. But trains run every 15 minutes (35-minute journey) directly to Gdańsk's Old Town, making the connection seamless.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Gdańsk worth visiting?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. It's one of Poland's most historically significant and visually stunning cities—the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, home to one of the richest architectural complexes in Poland, and the "World Capital of Amber." The combination of profound history and meticulous beauty is unforgettable.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the most important thing to see?</strong><br/>A: The European Solidarity Centre and the shipyard where the movement began. This is where history pivoted—where workers in 1980 started a chain of events that helped end Communist rule and brought down the Berlin Wall. The Old Town's Royal Route (Golden Gate to Green Gate) is the second must-see.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How long do I need in Gdańsk?</strong><br/>A: A full day is ideal. Plan 2 hours for the European Solidarity Centre, 3–4 hours wandering the Old Town (including Long Market, Neptune Fountain, and amber shopping), and leave time for lunch at a milk bar. If you're tight on time, focus on the Old Town and Solidarity Centre—you can cover both in 5–6 hours.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Why is Gdańsk called a "phoenix city"?</strong><br/>A: Nearly 95% of the Old Town was destroyed in WWII (which began here at Westerplatte on September 1, 1939). After 1945, the city painstakingly rebuilt itself from photographs and engravings, reconstructing the colorful Hanseatic façades stone by stone. Walking through it today, you'd never know it was once rubble—it's an architectural resurrection.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the deal with amber?</strong><br/>A: Gdańsk sits on the Baltic coast, where amber—fossilized tree resin from 40 million years ago—washes ashore. The city has been a center of amber trade for centuries and proudly calls itself the "World Capital of Amber." You'll find countless shops selling jewelry, sculptures, and pieces with insects frozen in time. It's called "Baltic gold" for a reason.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I walk from the cruise port?</strong><br/>A: You're in Gdynia, not Gdańsk, so walking isn't practical. Take the train—it's easy, frequent, affordable, and part of the experience.</p>
