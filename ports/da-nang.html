          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The coast of central Vietnam emerged through morning haze as our ship approached Tien Sa Port, the Marble Mountains rising from rice paddies like giant stone sentinels. I had read about this region—the ancient Champa kingdom, three UNESCO World Heritage sites, the lanterns of Hoi An—but nothing prepared me for the sensory richness that awaited. The air carried incense and sea salt as we docked, honking horns echoing across the harbor, and passengers could already see motorbikes streaming along the coastal road, honking their way through a landscape where ancient temples stood beside modern resorts.</p>

            <p>A driver named Minh met passengers at the port gate with a smile that felt genuinely warm rather than commercial. Over the next eight hours he would become my guide to a Vietnam I had only imagined. The first stop was the Marble Mountains, five limestone peaks named for the elements—metal, water, wood, fire, and earth. We climbed stone steps worn smooth by centuries of pilgrims, entering caves transformed into Buddhist sanctuaries, the air cool and incense-heavy, shafts of light piercing through holes in the rock ceiling to illuminate golden statues below.</p>

            <p>Inside Am Phu Cave, I descended into a surreal recreation of the Buddhist underworld—sculpted demons and tortured souls illuminated by dim bulbs, the passage narrowing until I had to crouch to continue. It was theatrical and unsettling and oddly profound. When I emerged into sunlight at the mountain summit, the view stretched from Da Nang's beaches to the distant Hai Van Pass, and I felt I had traveled not just through space but through cosmologies—from the underworld to the heavens in the span of an hour. My breath caught at the panorama below, this land where so much suffering and beauty had coexisted.</p>

            <p>Hoi An consumed my afternoon and captured my heart. This ancient trading port has been preserved almost perfectly since its 15th-century heyday, when Japanese, Chinese, and European merchants filled its streets with silk and ceramics and spices. I walked through yellow-ochre buildings draped with bougainvillea, across the iconic Japanese Covered Bridge, past tailors offering custom suits in 24 hours (I measured myself for one—$120 for wool-blend, delivered to the ship). The town smelled of pho broth and fresh bread from French-influenced bakeries, the particular perfume of a culture that has absorbed its occupiers rather than being erased by them.</p>

            <p>Lunch at a riverside restaurant cost me $8 for cao lau—the Hoi An noodle specialty made with water from a specific ancient well—plus spring rolls, cold beer, and fresh fruit. I sat watching the Thu Bon River flow past, wooden boats loaded with vegetables drifting toward the market, and felt something shift in my understanding of value. Everything here was beautiful and affordable. The exchange rate made luxury accessible, yet the hospitality felt offered rather than sold. When my server noticed I'd photographed my meal, she brought me an extra portion to try, refusing additional payment. Her generosity touched me deeply.</p>

            <p>As afternoon shadows lengthened, I hired a cyclo—a three-wheeled bicycle taxi—to pedal me through the old quarter. My driver, a weathered man named Tuan who spoke fragmentary English, pointed out details I would have missed: the Chinese assembly halls where merchants once gathered, the shrine where locals pray for good fishing, the Japanese tombs hidden behind modern buildings. He had pedaled tourists through these streets for forty years, he told me, since the war ended and foreigners began returning. When I asked about the war, he shrugged. "All gone now. We are friends." The simplicity of that forgiveness, offered from a man who surely remembered terrible things, humbled me profoundly.</p>

            <p>I returned to Da Nang as evening approached, determined to see the Dragon Bridge—a 666-meter structure shaped like a golden dragon spanning the Han River. On weekend evenings, the dragon breathes actual fire and water at 9 PM, but even without the pyrotechnics, the bridge was spectacular. I walked its length as lights began to illuminate the serpentine form, street vendors selling grilled corn and fresh coconut along the riverfront. The new Vietnam pulsed with energy here—young couples on motorbikes, families eating grilled fish at plastic tables, the city modernizing at breathtaking speed while somehow maintaining its soul.</p>

            <p>Dinner found me at a street stall near the port, eating banh mi—that perfect fusion sandwich born of French colonialism and Vietnamese resourcefulness—for less than $2. The bread was impossibly crisp, the pork savory and perfectly seasoned, the cilantro and pickled vegetables cutting through richness with bright acidity. I sat on a plastic stool watching the last light fade over the South China Sea, grateful beyond words for this day, this meal, this country that had suffered so much and emerged so gracious.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Tuan on his cyclo, pedaling slowly through Hoi An's ancient streets, pointing out a hidden shrine with his weathered hand, then turning to say "all gone now, we are friends" about a war that shaped both our nations. My heart ached with the weight of that forgiveness, the magnitude of grace from a man who had every reason to harbor bitterness. I understood something new about resilience that afternoon—not just survival, but the transformation of suffering into welcome.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Da Nang and Hoi An taught me that the most meaningful encounters happen in places still accessible to ordinary travelers, places where a $2 sandwich can be revelatory and a cyclo ride can become a lesson in grace. What I learned here will stay with me: that Vietnam rewards those who slow down, that the ancient and modern coexist more harmoniously than I had imagined, and that forgiveness offered freely is the greatest gift one nation can give another.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Most cruise ships dock at Tien Sa Port, a working commercial facility about 7 km from downtown Da Nang and 30 km from Hoi An. Some ships use Chan May Port, approximately one hour north, which is closer to Hue Imperial City. The port offers basic amenities—restrooms, souvenir shops, money exchange—but most passengers head immediately to attractions. Taxis and organized tours gather at the port exit.</p>

            <p>Currency is Vietnamese Dong (VND); ATMs available near the port and throughout Da Nang. Credit cards accepted at larger establishments but cash essential for local vendors and markets. English spoken at tourist sites but limited elsewhere; basic phrases appreciated. The climate is tropical—hot and humid, with rainy season from September to January. Wheelchair accessibility is limited at ancient sites and Marble Mountains; Hoi An's old town is mostly flat but cobblestoned.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Da Nang and central Vietnam require vehicle transportation—distances between attractions make walking impractical. Multiple options exist for independent travelers willing to venture beyond ship excursions.</p>

            <p><strong>Private Driver/Guide:</strong> Hire a driver for the day through your ship or independent booking. Expect $60-100 for a full day including vehicle and basic guiding. Drivers typically speak some English and know the routes well. Book ahead during peak season for guaranteed return to ship. This offers the best flexibility for visiting multiple sites at your own pace.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Metered taxis available at the port. To Hoi An approximately $20-25 one way (45 minutes). To downtown Da Nang approximately $8-10. Use reputable companies like Mai Linh or Vinasun. Grab (ride-hailing app) works in Da Nang and often cheaper than taxis. Go independent with taxis for flexibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship Excursions:</strong> Organized tours to Hoi An, Marble Mountains, My Son, and Hue available through your cruise line. Higher cost ($80-150) but guaranteed return to ship, English-speaking guides, and air-conditioned transport. Recommended for first-time visitors or those preferring structured experiences. Book ahead—popular excursions sell out.</p>

            <p><strong>Cyclo:</strong> Three-wheeled bicycle taxis in Hoi An for leisurely exploration ($5-10/hour). Not suitable for long distances but ideal for touring the ancient town. Low stamina required. Negotiate price before starting.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Marble Mountains involve significant stair climbing—hundreds of steps with no elevator alternative. Hoi An's old town is mostly flat but has uneven cobblestones. My Son Sanctuary requires walking on unpaved paths. Wheelchair users face challenges at most ancient sites. Ship excursions can advise on accessibility options for specific tours.</p>

            <p>Central Vietnam offers three UNESCO World Heritage sites plus stunning natural and urban attractions. Most cruisers can realistically visit two or three sites in a single port day. Ship excursions guarantee timing; go independent with private driver for flexibility. Book ahead for popular tours.</p>

            <h3>Hoi An Ancient Town (UNESCO)</h3>
            <p>Vietnam's best-preserved ancient trading port, 30 km from Tien Sa. Yellow-ochre buildings, Japanese Covered Bridge, Chinese assembly halls, lantern-lined streets, and legendary tailors offering 24-hour custom clothing. Wander freely or hire a guide ($15-20). Cao lau noodles and banh mi essential eating ($3-8 per meal). Allow 3-4 hours minimum. Go independent by taxi/driver for flexibility, or ship excursion for guided narrative. Moderate stamina on flat cobblestones. Mostly accessible but uneven surfaces throughout.</p>

            <h3>Marble Mountains</h3>
            <p>Five limestone peaks with Buddhist temples, caves, and panoramic views. Am Phu Cave recreates the Buddhist underworld; Huyen Khong Cave houses a sanctuary. Elevator available to bypass some stairs ($2), but full exploration requires climbing hundreds of steps. Entry $3 plus elevator. Allow 2-3 hours. Located between port and Hoi An—combine easily with Hoi An visit. Go independent or ship excursion. High stamina for full exploration; partial access via elevator. Not wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <h3>My Son Sanctuary (UNESCO)</h3>
            <p>Champa kingdom temple complex, 70 km from port. Hindu temples dating from the 4th-14th centuries, partially ruined by bombing during the Vietnam War. Traditional music performances included in entry ($12). Allow 3-4 hours including travel. Best visited with knowledgeable guide for context. Ship excursion recommended for narrative; independent by private driver possible but book ahead. Moderate stamina on unpaved paths. Limited accessibility.</p>

            <h3>Dragon Bridge & Da Nang City</h3>
            <p>The 666-meter dragon bridge breathes fire and water on Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings at 9 PM—if your ship stays late, don't miss it. By day, explore Da Nang's riverside walk, Han Market, and Lady Buddha statue at Linh Ung Pagoda. Free to walk the bridge; pagoda free. Allow 2-3 hours for city exploration. Go independent by taxi. Low stamina for city walking; pagoda involves moderate stairs. Partially accessible.</p>

            <h3>Hue Imperial City (UNESCO)</h3>
            <p>Former capital of Vietnam with citadel, forbidden purple city, and royal tombs. Only practical from Chan May Port (1 hour) or as full-day trip from Tien Sa (2+ hours each way via scenic Hai Van Pass). Entry $8 for citadel; tombs additional. Allow full day. Ship excursion strongly recommended given distances; guaranteed return essential. Moderate stamina. Partially accessible within citadel grounds.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Da Nang and central Vietnam occupy one of the world's most storied coastlines. The ancient Champa kingdom flourished here from the 2nd through 17th centuries, leaving behind the Hindu temples of My Son. Hoi An rose to prominence in the 15th-19th centuries as Southeast Asia's most cosmopolitan trading port, where Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and European merchants created a uniquely hybrid culture still visible in its architecture and culinary traditions.</p>

            <p>The Vietnam War (called the American War here) scarred this region deeply. Da Nang hosted the largest American military base in Vietnam, and the surrounding countryside saw intense combat. My Son's temples bear bomb damage; many villages still feel the effects of Agent Orange. Yet the Vietnamese approach to this burden continues to astound visitors—there is acknowledgment without bitterness, memory without vengeance, a forward-looking resilience that offers lessons in how nations might heal from trauma.</p>

            <p>Modern Da Nang has transformed into Vietnam's most livable city—cleaner, better organized, and more accessible than Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. The Dragon Bridge symbolizes this new confidence: a $88 million statement in steel and LED lights, breathing fire over a river where fishing boats still cast nets at dawn. The contrast encapsulates Vietnam's present moment—ancient and ultramodern, Buddhist and capitalist, wounded and thriving—all somehow coexisting in creative tension.</p>

            <p>Hoi An's lanterns, now a global symbol of Vietnamese charm, began as practical lighting. The lantern festival on each lunar month's 14th day sees the old town lit entirely by these silk-covered orbs, motorcycles banned, the streets returned to pedestrians and candlelight. To walk those ancient lanes on such an evening is to step back centuries while remaining utterly in the present—a gift few ports can offer.</p>

              <summary>How far is Hoi An from Da Nang cruise port?</summary>
              <p>Hoi An Ancient Town is approximately 30 km (45 minutes by taxi) from Tien Sa Port. This UNESCO World Heritage town is the most popular destination for cruisers, known for its preserved ancient architecture, lanterns, and famous tailors who can produce custom clothing within 24 hours.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I get custom tailoring in one day?</summary>
              <p>Yes—Hoi An's tailors specialize in rapid custom work. Most can measure, cut, and deliver a wool-blend suit or silk dress within 24 hours.

              <summary>When does the Dragon Bridge breathe fire?</summary>
              <p>Every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening at 9 PM, the Dragon Bridge shoots fire from its mouth and water spray from both sides. The show lasts approximately 15 minutes. If your ship stays late enough, it's worth seeing from the riverfront. On other nights, the bridge is still beautifully illuminated.</p>

              <summary>Is it safe to travel independently in Da Nang?</summary>
              <p>Yes, Da Nang is considered very safe for tourists. The main challenges are traffic (look carefully when crossing streets—motorbikes don't stop) and language barriers outside tourist areas. Using reputable taxi companies, the Grab app, or hiring a private driver makes independent exploration straightforward.</p>
