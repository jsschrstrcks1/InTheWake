  "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed *Radiance of the Seas*. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nWhen I stepped aboard in Vancouver, the cast boot around my ankle drew more attention than my smile. I’d sprained it three months earlier—nothing heroic, just a tumble on the school steps after chasing a seventh-grader who’d forgotten his trombone. But for a woman who lives by the bell schedule, being forced to slow down felt like punishment. The crew didn’t see it that way. From the first greeting—“Welcome home, Miss Harper”—to the way the stateroom attendant quietly left an extra ice pack in my mini-fridge, I was reminded that kindness moves faster than pain. One barista learned my order (“half-sweet mocha, extra patience”) by day two. The ship itself seemed to conspire in my healing.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nBoarding at Canada Place was smoother than my own stride. The pier staff guided me to the accessibility lane, and within twenty minutes I was leaning on the rail, watching seaplanes lift off like prayers over the harbor. Disembarkation in Seward a week later felt harder—not physically, but emotionally. There’s something about the final morning at sea, the slow rotation of the ship into the fjord light, that makes you realize the horizon was never the point. It was learning to look up again.\n\n## The Real Talk\nNot every moment was picture-perfect. There were times I caught my reflection in the elevator mirror and hated the limp. The jogging track mocked me. And yes, sometimes the Wi-Fi vanished like motivation on a Monday. But one evening near Hubbard Glacier, I sat alone on Deck 12 as the captain swung us broadside to the ice. The ship fell utterly silent—no announcements, no chatter—just the groan of ancient ice cracking open. A stranger, maybe late sixties, eased into the chair beside me. He didn’t offer a drink; he offered a story. Thirty years married, first cruise since his wife’s chemo ended. He said, “You never realize how loud healing is until you hear it echo.” We sat there in shared quiet until a chunk of ice calved and thundered into the sea. For the first time in months, I didn’t wince at the sound of breaking. I whispered, mostly to myself, “This is what grace sounds like.”\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nRadiance is one of the easier ships I’ve navigated—wide corridors, elevators at every turn, and crew who don’t treat accessibility like charity. The spa arranged a short-duration massage suited for limited mobility. Even tender ports like Icy Strait Point were managed with thoughtful ramps and steady hands. My favorite detail? Crew members never hovered—they simply appeared when needed, like well-timed commas in a long sentence.\n\n## A Female Crewmate’s Perspective\nOn day four, a housekeeper named Lila found me sketching glaciers in the Solarium. She sat down on break and said, “We all come to sea for something. Some to run, some to rest.” She told me she sends most of her paycheck home to Cebu and hasn’t seen her children in two years. Then she smiled: “But I still get to watch people heal.” There was no sermon in her words, yet I felt one forming in my chest. Grace again—steady, unspectacular, holy.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nBy the time we reached Seward, I no longer cared how fast I walked. I cared that I could stand on my own deck and breathe without rushing the view. Radiance didn’t cure me; it recalibrated me. It taught me that healing isn’t about getting back to normal—it’s about finding beauty in the limp. If you see a woman on the next sailing, camera in one hand and a slow step in the other, say hello. I might just tell you what grace sounds like in glacier light."

Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## Intro\nWe picked a **Western Caribbean** itinerary from **Tampa** in **January 2025**: sea day to warm up, then **Cozumel**, **Costa Maya**, and **Roatán**. I told my nine-year-old—soccer-obsessed, picky eater—that this trip could be ours. Radiance felt sized for conversation: generous windows, crew who learned first names, and just enough sparkle to make bedtime a negotiation.\n\n## Small Ship, Big Room for Moments\nDay one we found the **sports court** and a sunset pickup game; day two the **poolside movies** bribed us into sitting still. My kid discovered the soft-serve machine; I discovered he’ll try new foods if they follow pizza. Evenings in the **Schooner Bar** meant quiet trivia and a chair that looked out to the kind of dusk you only get at sea.\n\n## Ashore\n**Cozumel**: we skipped the jeep tour and did tacos + beach time; the sand turned dad jokes into currency. **Costa Maya**: rented a golf cart in Mahahual and chased pelicans down the malecon. **Roatán**: a reef snorkel where my kid grabbed my hand when a sea turtle drifted by—no words, just the squeeze.\n\n## Budget Notes\nMain Dining handled the picky-eater matrix; **Windjammer** covered the rest. I bought the **Refreshment Package** (worth it for fresh juices and sodas). Book shore time privately or walk-up—plenty of safe, simple options.\n\n## Tear-Tug\nOn the last night he handed me a crumpled napkin list titled “Top 5 Dad + Me.” Number 1 was “laughed until we choked on ice cream.” I kept it. It’s in my wallet now.\n\n## Practical Links\n• **Search Tampa sailings** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search  \n• **Refreshment Package** → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/drink-packages.html#refreshment  \n• **Packing: warm-water** → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/packing-lists.html\n",

Elevators were close, theater aisles forgiving. I pushed the pace only once and learned my lesson.\n\n## Tear-Tug\nAt **Ketchikan**, rain stitched the docks into a watercolor.
