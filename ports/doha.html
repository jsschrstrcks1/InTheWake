        <h1>Doha: When the Desert Learned to Dream in Glass</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Doha doesn't apologize for its ambition. Approaching the city by ship, you watch skyscrapers pierce the Arabian sky in impossible geometries — spiraling towers, buildings shaped like flames, architectural statements that seem to ignore gravity's suggestions. This is a city built on natural gas wealth and pure determination, where Bedouin heritage meets billion-dollar vision, where falconry is practiced in the shadow of buildings that belong in science fiction.</p>

          <p>The Museum of Islamic Art stopped me in my tracks. I.M. Pei came out of retirement to design this building, and you can feel his precision in every angle. It rises from an artificial peninsula like a geometric prayer, limestone stacked in patterns that echo ancient Islamic architecture while remaining unmistakably modern. Inside, fourteen centuries of Islamic art span continents — ceramics from Persia, textiles from India, manuscripts from Spain, metalwork from Egypt. But it's the building itself that stays with me: those massive windows framing Doha Bay, the way afternoon light transforms the atrium into sacred geometry, the conviction that beauty and faith can share the same space.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting in Souq Waqif's Falcon Souq, watching an elderly Qatari man examine a peregrine falcon with the focused tenderness of someone handling history itself. Falconry here isn't a hobby — it's cultural memory, passed down through generations when survival in the desert required partnership with hunting birds. The falcon wore a tiny leather hood embroidered in gold thread. The skyscrapers gleamed overhead. Two timelines occupied the same moment, neither diminishing the other.
          </div>

          <p>Souq Waqif feels like stepping through a portal. The traditional market sprawls through narrow alleys where spice vendors sell saffron by the gram, where tailors stitch thobes in open-air shops, where smoke from grilling meat drifts past stalls selling frankincense and oud. It's been restored — this is heritage preservation, not accidental authenticity — but the energy is real. Qatari families shop alongside tourists, old men sip tea and play backgammon, cats nap in doorways. This is the heart Doha refuses to forget even as it builds toward tomorrow.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Museum of Islamic Art (MIA)</h4>
          <p>I.M. Pei's architectural masterpiece housing 1,400 years of Islamic art across three continents. World-class collection of ceramics, textiles, metalwork, manuscripts in a 45,000 m² building on artificial peninsula. Free admission. Café with stunning bay views. 20-minute walk from Souq Waqif. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. The building alone is worth the visit — this is museum architecture at its finest.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Souq Waqif</h4>
          <p>Traditional Arabian market in Doha's heart — labyrinth of alleys selling spices, perfumes, textiles, handicrafts, jewelry. Falcon Souq displays Qatar's falconry heritage. Restaurants serve authentic Qatari/Middle Eastern cuisine. Open daily 9am-10pm (later on weekends). Free to explore. 10 minutes from cruise terminal. Plan 2-3 hours browsing. Best authentic cultural experience in Doha — this is where the city's soul lives.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Doha Corniche</h4>
          <p>7-kilometer waterfront promenade curving along Doha Bay. Spectacular skyline views, palm-lined walkways, parks, dhow harbor. Popular for walking/jogging. Best at sunset when skyscrapers light up. Free. Easily accessible from cruise terminal. The contrast between traditional wooden dhows and futuristic towers captures Qatar's identity perfectly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Katara Cultural Village</h4>
          <p>Sprawling cultural complex with art galleries, amphitheater, performance spaces, restaurants, and beachfront. Traditional architecture meets contemporary design. Pigeon Towers, Katara Mosque, opera house. Free entry to grounds (events vary). 15-20 minutes from port. Half-day if attending performances; 1-2 hours for grounds. Photography opportunities everywhere.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">The Pearl-Qatar</h4>
          <p>Man-made island featuring luxury shopping, upscale dining, marina with superyachts, Mediterranean-style architecture. Dubbed "Arabian Riviera" — distinctly opulent. Free to explore. 20 minutes from port. Budget 1-2 hours. Not traditional Qatar, but showcases the country's modern ambitions and wealth.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dhow Cruise</h4>
          <p>Traditional wooden boat dinner cruise along Corniche with skyline views. Typically includes buffet dinner, Arabic entertainment. Evening cruises ~2-3 hours. Prices vary (around 200-300 QAR / $55-80). Book through cruise terminal or hotel. Romantic way to see Doha's architectural transformation from water — the perspective sailors have known for millennia, reimagined.</p>

          <ul>

            <li><strong>Doha Metro:</strong> Ultra-modern driverless metro opened 2019 (built for FIFA World Cup). Clean, efficient, affordable. Gold Line serves Souq Waqif, Msheireb Downtown. Consider for longer distances.</li>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>

            <li><strong>Arabic Mezze:</strong> Small plates — hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, fattoush, grilled halloumi. Perfect for sharing. Souq Waqif restaurants excel at mezze spreads.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Gulf fish, hammour (grouper), prawns. Often grilled with Arabic spices or in saffron-infused rice dishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Karak Chai:</strong> Spiced milky tea — cardamom, saffron, cinnamon. Served sweet and strong. National beverage. Stalls throughout souq pour it fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Qatar produces exceptional dates — sweet, plump, often stuffed with nuts or chocolate. Traditional hospitality offering.</li>
            <li><strong>Arabic Sweets:</strong> Baklava, kunafa (shredded pastry with cheese/syrup), luqaimat (sweet dumplings). Rich, syrupy, unapologetically decadent.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Qatar is Muslim country — alcohol only available in hotels/licensed venues, not in souq or public spaces.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Modest dress essential — cover shoulders and knees. Women should bring light scarf for religious/cultural sites. Respect local customs.</li>
            <li>Museum of Islamic Art is free and air-conditioned — perfect midday refuge from heat. Don't miss the MIA Park behind building for skyline photos.</li>
            <li>Souq Waqif gets crowded afternoons/evenings. Visit early morning for quieter browsing and better photo lighting.</li>
            <li>Negotiate prices at souq — bargaining expected and part of the experience. Start around 60% of asking price.</li>
            <li>October-April is comfortable; May-September dangerously hot (40°C+). Carry water, seek shade, pace yourself.</li>
            <li>Friday is holy day — some shops closed or open later. Souq Waqif still bustling but plan accordingly.</li>
            <li>Qatar hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup — infrastructure is world-class (metro, stadiums, facilities). City designed for visitors.</li>
            <li>ATMs everywhere; credit cards widely accepted. Qatari Riyal stable currency. Tipping appreciated but not mandatory (~10%).</li>
            <li>Photography allowed most places but ask permission before photographing Qatari people, especially women.</li>
            <li>English signage ubiquitous — navigation easy even without Arabic.</li>
          </ul>
