            <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook</h2></summary>
            <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Barbados announced itself before we even docked — the scent of salt air mixing with something sweet (was that sugarcane?) as our ship approached the Bridgetown harbor. This easternmost Caribbean island has been welcoming sailors since 1625 (roughly 400 years ago, or about 146,000 days of Caribbean waves lapping the same coral shores, or long enough for the British to perfect their cricket and tea while Bajans perfected their rum), when the British first claimed it, beginning what would become one of the Caribbean's most stable colonial relationships. For 341 years (roughly three-and-a-half centuries, or about 124,465 days of continuous British rule, or longer than the United States has existed), until independence in 1966, Barbados remained under continuous British rule — longer than almost any other Caribbean territory. You can feel that history in every chattel house, every coral stone church, every raised glass of Mount Gay rum.</p>

          <p>Here's something that struck me standing at the port: George Washington once stood on this same island in 1751 (roughly 274 years ago, or about when the American Revolution was still 25 years away and a teenage Washington was learning lessons that would shape a nation, or the year that connected the future first president to the only foreign soil he'd ever touch), at age nineteen. It remains the only foreign country the first American president ever visited. He came for his ailing half-brother's health, stayed two months (roughly 60 days, or about enough time to catch smallpox that would grant him immunity during the Revolutionary War, or just long enough for this Caribbean island to leave an imprint on American history), and caught smallpox — the immunity from which may have saved his life during the Revolutionary War. History runs deep here, in ways you don't expect.</p>

          <p>What struck me immediately was how different Barbados feels from the rest of the Caribbean. The British influence runs deep — they drive on the left, cricket is a religion, and afternoon tea is a genuine thing. They call it "Little England," and the nickname fits more than you'd think. But underneath that colonial veneer beats an unmistakably Bajan heart: the rhythms of calypso and soca, the fire of pepper sauce on flying fish, the warmth of strangers who call you "love" and actually seem to mean it. It's this blend — 400 years of British formality married to Caribbean soul — that makes Barbados feel unlike anywhere else in the region.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Floating in the impossibly clear water of Carlisle Bay, snorkeling over the Berwyn shipwreck while a sea turtle glided past, close enough to touch (I didn't). She looked at me with ancient eyes, unhurried, unbothered — as if to remind me that she'd been swimming these waters long before cruise ships existed and would be here long after. My eyes filled with tears behind my snorkel mask, though I couldn't tell you exactly why. Sometimes the best Caribbean moments don't require an excursion booking — just a willingness to get in the water and see what shows up.
          </div>

          <p>Harrison's Cave exceeded my expectations. I'd braced for a touristy underground train ride through mediocre formations. Instead, we descended into a genuinely spectacular crystallized limestone cavern — waterfalls, pools, stalactites that took millions of years to form. The tram makes it accessible without requiring a spelunking adventure. Worth the drive into the island's interior.</p>

          <p>But let's talk about rum, because you simply cannot understand Barbados without understanding its relationship with the spirit. Mount Gay, founded in 1703 (roughly 322 years ago, or about 117,530 days of continuous rum production, or old enough to make every other "craft" distillery look like it opened yesterday), holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating rum distillery in the Caribbean — possibly the world. The distillery tour taught me something I'd never known: in 1645 (roughly 380 years ago, or about when the British Navy realized that rum rations might be the secret to naval supremacy, or the year that turned Caribbean sugarcane into liquid morale for an empire), a Royal Navy edict began the tradition of the daily rum ration for sailors, a practice that continued for over 300 years (roughly three centuries, or about 109,500 days of sailors receiving their daily tot, or long enough to make rum as British as tea) until "Black Tot Day" in 1970 (roughly 55 years ago, or about the saddest day in Royal Navy history when the last official rum ration was poured, or the end of a 325-year tradition that fueled the British fleet). Barbados didn't just produce rum; it fueled the entire British Navy's liquid courage.</p>

          <p>The island is also credited as the birthplace of rum punch — that perfect balance of "one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak" that every Caribbean bartender knows. Today, Barbados has over 1,500 rum shops scattered across its 166 square miles. That's roughly one rum shop for every 190 residents. These aren't touristy beach bars; they're corner establishments where locals gather, talk cricket, and pour generous measures. I stopped into one near Speightstown, paid $3 BBD for a rum and coconut water (roughly $1.50 USD), and left understanding why Bajans take their rum culture seriously.</p>

            <p>Looking back at my time in Barbados, I realize what makes this island different from other Caribbean destinations. It's not just the beaches or the rum or the history, though all of those are exceptional. It's the way 400 years of British colonial structure somehow coexists with unbreakable Caribbean warmth. The lesson I took from Barbados is that identity isn't either/or — a place can be "Little England" and fiercely Bajan at the same time. That turtle in Carlisle Bay knew something I'm still learning: some things simply belong here, and they don't need to explain themselves.</p>

        <details class="port-section" id="cruise_port" open>
          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <p>The Bridgetown Cruise Terminal sits directly at the edge of the capital city, making it one of the most convenient cruise ports in the Caribbean. Ships dock directly at the pier without tendering, and the walk into downtown Bridgetown takes less than fifteen minutes. The terminal building itself is modern and well-equipped, featuring duty-free shops, jewelry stores, souvenir vendors, a telecommunications center with WiFi, and an efficient tourist information desk staffed by knowledgeable locals.</p>
          <p>The terminal area includes ATMs dispensing both Barbados Dollars (BBD) and US dollars. The BBD is pegged at 2:1 to USD, and US currency is widely accepted throughout the island — though you'll often get change back in BBD. Taxi stands with fixed-rate pricing are located just outside the terminal. The cruise port is one of the best in the Caribbean for passengers with mobility challenges: the terminal is fully accessible, downtown Bridgetown has paved sidewalks, and taxis can accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="port-section" id="getting_around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <p>Taxis are the most common transportation for cruise visitors, with clearly posted fixed rates at the terminal. Expect to pay about $10-15 USD to Carlisle Bay, $25-30 to the west coast beaches at Mullins or Paynes Bay, and $40-50 for longer trips to Harrison's Cave or St Nicholas Abbey. Official taxis have a "Z" on their license plates. Drivers accept US dollars, and tipping 10-15% is appreciated but not required. Many taxi drivers offer island tours for approximately $25-30 per hour — negotiate the rate and itinerary before departing.</p>
          <p>The public bus system offers the cheapest transportation on the island. Yellow buses run government routes, while blue "ZR" vans operate private routes. Fares are just $2 BBD ($1 USD) to anywhere on the island, but buses can be crowded, hot, and unpredictable in schedule. The bus terminal in Bridgetown is about a 10-minute walk from the cruise terminal. For families or groups, taxis often prove more economical than multiple bus fares.</p>
          <p>Car rentals are available from agencies near the port starting around $50-70 per day for compact vehicles. However, remember that Barbados drives on the left (British style), roads can be narrow and winding, and roundabouts follow British conventions. Most cruise visitors find taxis more practical than self-driving for a port day.</p>

        <section id="excursions">
          <details class="port-section" open>
            <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <p>Barbados offers an excellent mix of beach, history, and culinary experiences. Most excursions can be booked through your cruise line's shore excursion desk, or independently through local operators for often lower prices. Book ahead for Harrison's Cave and Mount Gay tours during peak cruise season — these fill up quickly when multiple ships are in port.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Carlisle Bay Beach &amp; Snorkeling</h4>
          <p>The closest quality beach to the port, about 10 minutes by taxi ($10-15 USD). The bay features calm, crystal-clear water with six shipwrecks in the marine park providing exceptional snorkeling. Sea turtle sightings are common — most visitors see at least one. Chair and umbrella rentals run about $15-20 for the day. Snorkel gear can be rented from beach vendors for approximately $10-15. This is the ideal default if you want Caribbean beach time without a long drive.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Harrison's Cave Eco-Adventure</h4>
          <p>A spectacular underground crystallized limestone cave system explored via electric tram. You'll descend through towering stalactites, flowing waterfalls, and crystalline pools formed over millions of years. Located about 45 minutes from the cruise port in the island's interior. Tickets run approximately $35-40 per person for the standard tram tour. Reserve online in advance at harrisonscave.com or book through your cruise line. The caves maintain a comfortable temperature year-round, and the tram makes this accessible for most mobility levels.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mount Gay Rum Experience</h4>
          <p>The world's oldest continuously operating rum distillery, documented since 1703. The Visitor Centre in Bridgetown is just 15 minutes from the cruise terminal. The Signature Tour ($25 per person) includes distillery history, production process explanation, and tastings of four rums. Premium cocktail and lunch experiences run $50-75. Book in advance at mountgayrum.com — tours fill quickly on cruise ship days. Note: the actual production distillery is in St. Lucy parish; the Visitor Centre offers the more accessible experience for cruise passengers.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Historic Bridgetown Walking Tour</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011. Walk from the cruise terminal to explore Parliament Buildings (dating to 1639), the Careenage inner harbor, the Garrison Savannah military complex, and George Washington House where the future president stayed in 1751. No reservation needed — you can explore independently with a map from the tourist information desk. Guided walking tours are available for about $20-30 per person.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">St Nicholas Abbey</h4>
          <p>One of only three surviving Jacobean mansions in the Western Hemisphere, built in 1658. The coral stone great house features Dutch gables and mullioned windows. Tours include the working rum distillery, heritage railway rides through cane fields, and screenings of 1930s home movies. About 45 minutes from port. Tickets approximately $30 per person. Book at stnicholasabbey.com or arrange through a taxi driver for a half-day tour.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">West Coast Beaches</h4>
          <p>Mullins Beach and Paynes Bay offer calmer water and upscale beach bars with sea turtle sightings. About 30-45 minutes from port by taxi ($25-30). Worth the drive for a premium beach day experience.</p>

            <li><strong>Rum Punch:</strong> Barbados claims to be the birthplace of rum punch. The traditional recipe: "one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak." Every bar has their own take; Mount Gay rum is the gold standard base. Over 1,500 rum shops across the island serve it.</li>

          <p><em>These notes follow soundings in another's wake — researched thoroughly but awaiting the day I can verify them firsthand.</em></p>
          <p>My recommendation for Barbados depends entirely on your priorities. For beach lovers making their first visit, Carlisle Bay offers the best value: close to port, excellent snorkeling, and reliable turtle sightings without the premium prices of west coast beaches. Arrive early, claim a chair, and spend the day in water so clear you'll forget you're in the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>For history and culture enthusiasts, the combination of Historic Bridgetown (walkable from port) and Mount Gay Distillery (15 minutes by taxi) delivers an exceptional day. You'll understand why this island feels different from the rest of the Caribbean — that unique blend of British colonial structure and Bajan warmth.</p>
          <p>For those seeking something beyond typical cruise port experiences, St Nicholas Abbey or a local rum shop in Speightstown offers authentic encounters that most cruise passengers never find. However, if your time is limited or you simply want a relaxed port day, Carlisle Bay sits close enough that even a short port call allows for meaningful Caribbean time.</p>

            <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Barbados?</strong><br>A: Ships dock at the Bridgetown Cruise Terminal in the capital city. The terminal is walking distance to the UNESCO World Heritage downtown area and a short taxi ride to beaches and attractions.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What's the best beach near the Barbados cruise port?</strong><br>A: Carlisle Bay is the closest quality beach, about 10 minutes by taxi ($10-15 USD). It offers calm turquoise water, excellent snorkeling over six shipwrecks, reliable sea turtle sightings, and beach chair rentals for about $15-20.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Can I swim with sea turtles in Barbados?</strong><br>A: Yes, sea turtles are frequently spotted at Carlisle Bay and west coast beaches, especially Paynes Bay. Most snorkelers see at least one turtle. Remember: observe from a respectful distance — no touching the wildlife.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Barbados expensive for cruise passengers?</strong><br>A: Barbados is mid-range for the Caribbean. Taxis are pricey but can be shared with other passengers. Local rum shops offer authentic drinks at affordable prices ($3-5 BBD). Mount Gay and Harrison's Cave tours run $25-40 per person.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Do I need to book excursions in advance?</strong><br>A: For Harrison's Cave and Mount Gay distillery tours, advance booking is recommended during peak cruise season, especially when multiple ships are in port. Carlisle Bay beach visits and downtown Bridgetown walking tours don't require reservations.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What currency is used in Barbados?</strong><br>A: The Barbados Dollar (BBD) is pegged 2:1 to USD. US dollars are widely accepted throughout the island, though you'll often receive change in BBD. ATMs at the cruise terminal dispense both currencies.</p>
