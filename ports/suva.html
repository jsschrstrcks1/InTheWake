        <h1>Suva: The Soul of the South Pacific</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Suva is not the Fiji of postcards and resort brochures. There are no overwater bungalows here, no pristine white-sand beaches stretching to infinity. Instead, Suva offers something more substantial — a living, breathing capital city where Indo-Fijian shopkeepers sell spices beside indigenous Fijian market vendors hawking tropical produce, where colonial architecture frames a harbor busy with commerce, where the University of the South Pacific draws students from across Oceania. This is real Fiji, multi-ethnic and modern, humid and bustling, and utterly fascinating.</p>

          <p>The ship docked at Kings Wharf, and within five minutes I was walking downtown Suva, no shuttle required. It's a rare gift — a cruise port where the city simply unfolds before you. The Suva Municipal Market was my first stop, a sprawling two-story maze of vendors selling kava roots bundled like firewood, papayas the size of footballs, reef fish laid out on ice, handicrafts carved from tropical hardwoods. The air thick with humidity, the scent of ginger and turmeric, voices calling in Fijian, Hindi, and English. This is the largest market in the South Pacific, and it pulses with life.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> In a village cultural center just outside Suva, I was invited to share kava. The bilo — a polished coconut shell — was filled from a communal tanoa bowl and passed to me. "Bula," I said, clapping once before drinking. The earthy, slightly numbing liquid tasted like rain-soaked soil. I clapped three times after finishing. The circle of Fijian men nodded, smiled, and the ceremony continued. For a brief moment, I wasn't a tourist. I was simply welcomed.
          </div>

          <p>The Fiji Museum, housed in Thurston Gardens, holds 3,700 years of Pacific history within its modest galleries. Oceanic voyaging canoes, war clubs carved with intricate totems, the rudder from HMS <em>Bounty</em>, and yes — the notorious cannibal forks, relics of a practice that ended in the 19th century but remains part of Fiji's complex history. The museum doesn't sanitize the past. It presents it with scholarly care and cultural respect. I spent two hours there and could have stayed longer.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fiji Museum at Thurston Gardens</h4>
          <p>Pacific history spanning 3,700 years — voyaging canoes, traditional weapons, pottery, HMS <em>Bounty</em> artifacts, cannibal forks, and colonial-era exhibits. Beautiful botanical gardens surround the museum. 15-min walk from port. ~10 FJD entry. Allow 1.5-2 hours. Air-conditioned, educational, essential.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Suva Municipal Market</h4>
          <p>Largest market in South Pacific. Fresh tropical produce (taro, cassava, papaya, breadfruit), bundled kava roots, reef fish, handicrafts, spices, and local street food. Overwhelming sensory experience. 5-min walk from port. Free entry. Go early (mornings busiest). Cash only. Allow 1-2 hours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Colonial Architecture Walk</h4>
          <p>Government Buildings (1939), Grand Pacific Hotel (1914, restored 2014), Parliament House, Albert Park. British colonial legacy visible in white-painted facades and tropical gardens. Self-guided walk from port. Free. Allow 1 hour. Combine with downtown exploration.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Colo-i-Suva Forest Park</h4>
          <p>Lush rainforest reserve 11 km from downtown — waterfalls, natural swimming holes, walking trails through tropical forest, birdwatching (honeyeaters, fantails, parrots). Taxi or organized tour required (~30 FJD round-trip taxi). 3-5 km trails. Bring swimsuit. Allow 2-3 hours. Nature escape.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kava Ceremony Experience</h4>
          <p>Traditional Fijian welcome ritual — drink yaqona (kava) from bilo (coconut shell), learn ceremonial etiquette (clapping, phrases), experience communal hospitality. Offered at cultural centers and village tours. Book through ship or local operators. Authentic cultural immersion. Kava is mildly sedative, earthy-tasting.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">University of the South Pacific Campus</h4>
          <p>Regional university serving 12 Pacific island nations. Beautiful campus with Oceania Centre for Arts, Culture and Pacific Studies showcasing contemporary Pacific art. 10-min taxi from port. Free to walk grounds. Cultural exhibits sometimes open to public. Academic heart of the region.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Suva highly walkable from Kings Wharf; market, museum, Government Buildings, shops all accessible on foot</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Plentiful and inexpensive (most downtown trips 5-15 FJD); agree on fare before departure or ensure meter running; licensed taxis safe and reliable</li>
            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Cheap but confusing routes for short-term visitors; taxis more practical for cruise passengers</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Best for Colo-i-Suva Forest Park, village visits, and cultural experiences with kava ceremonies</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but unnecessary — downtown walkable and taxis inexpensive</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Kava (Yaqona):</strong> Traditional drink from pounded roots mixed with water — mildly sedative, earthy taste, numbing effect; ceremonial and social</li>
            <li><strong>Fiji Bitter:</strong> Local lager — crisp, refreshing in tropical heat</li>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Embrace "Fiji time" — pace slower, service relaxed; rushing counterproductive; go with the flow</li>
            <li>Greet everyone with "Bula!" (hello) — Fijians are famously friendly; reciprocate warmth</li>
            <li>Suva Municipal Market best visited in morning (fresher produce, more vendors); afternoons quieter</li>
            <li>Bring small bills (Fiji Dollars) for market purchases and taxis</li>
            <li>Dress modestly when visiting villages or cultural sites — shoulders and knees covered; respect local customs</li>
            <li>Remove shoes before entering Fijian homes or temples — standard etiquette</li>
            <li>Kava ceremonies require participation etiquette — clap once before drinking, say "Bula," clap three times after; guides will instruct</li>
            <li>Rain likely even in dry season — bring light rain jacket or umbrella</li>
            <li>Photography courteous at markets and public spaces, but always ask permission before photographing people</li>
            <li>Sunscreen and insect repellent essential for Colo-i-Suva Forest Park</li>
            <li>Fiji Museum small but rich — budget time to read exhibits; well worth the entry fee</li>
            <li>Currency exchange available at banks downtown; ATMs reliable; credit cards accepted at most established shops</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Suva good for beaches?</strong><br/>A: No. Suva is not a beach destination. For beaches, visit the Mamanuca or Yasawa Islands (resort areas). Suva offers culture, history, markets, and rainforest — not resort-style beaches.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What is kava, and should I try it?</strong><br/>A: Kava (yaqona) is a traditional drink made from ground roots mixed with water. It's mildly sedative, numbs the mouth, and tastes earthy. Culturally significant. Safe to try. Effects mild. Ceremonial experience valuable.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How long to spend at the Fiji Museum?</strong><br/>A: 1.5-2 hours to see exhibits properly. Museum is small but densely packed with fascinating artifacts and history. Thurston Gardens surrounding it add another 30 minutes.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Suva safe for cruise visitors?</strong><br/>A: Yes, generally safe. Stick to downtown areas, market, and tourist sites during day. Avoid walking alone at night in unfamiliar areas. Use licensed taxis. Standard travel precautions apply.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I use US dollars?</strong><br/>A: Some tourist shops accept USD, but you'll get better value using Fiji Dollars. ATMs plentiful downtown. Exchange rates better at banks than on street. Credit cards widely accepted.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like?</strong><br/>A: Tropical and humid year-round. Dry season (May-Oct) less rain but still showers possible. Wet season (Nov-Apr) heavier rain, warmer temperatures. Always pack rain gear. Average temps 75-85°F.</p>
