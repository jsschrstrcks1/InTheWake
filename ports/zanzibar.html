        <h1>Zanzibar: Where the Scent of Cloves Meets the Sea</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The moment you step off the ship in Zanzibar, the air wraps around you — humid, warm, heavy with the sweet-spice scent of cloves. This is the Spice Island, and it announces itself before you've taken ten steps from the gangway. Stone Town unfolds directly from the harbor, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways and coral-stone buildings where Africa meets Arabia, where the call to prayer drifts over rooftops adorned with carved wooden doors that have witnessed centuries of sultans, merchants, and monsoon winds.</p>

          <p>Stone Town earned its UNESCO World Heritage designation in 2000, but it's been significant far longer than that. For a thousand years, this was the crossroads of the Indian Ocean trade — Persian traders brought spices, Arabian merchants brought Islam, Indian craftsmen brought ornate architectural details, and European colonizers brought ambition. What remains is a cultural fusion unlike anywhere else, preserved in every carved doorway, every shadowed corridor, every weathered facade.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Getting lost in Stone Town's alleyways — genuinely, helplessly lost. Every turn led deeper into the maze, past women in black buibui robes carrying baskets of mangoes, past workshops where carpenters shaped new doors using centuries-old techniques, past tiny mosques tucked into corners I wouldn't have found on purpose. A small boy saw my confusion and wordlessly led me back toward the waterfront, refusing the coins I offered. His grandmother watched from a doorway, smiling. In Stone Town, you're never truly lost — just temporarily between destinations.
          </div>

          <p>The carved doors are Stone Town's signature. Over 500 historic doors remain, each one a work of art — massive wooden panels studded with brass spikes (originally to prevent elephant attacks in India, purely decorative here), intricate geometric patterns, verses from the Quran, lotus flowers, fish, chains. The size and elaborateness of your door advertised your wealth and status. Walking these streets is like touring an open-air museum where the exhibits are still in daily use.</p>

          <p>But Zanzibar isn't just history. It's a living, breathing place where fishermen still sail dhows with lateen sails, where the evening food market at Forodhani Gardens erupts into a carnival of grilled seafood and Zanzibar pizza (a filled flatbread nothing like Italian pizza but delicious in its own right), where spice farms 30 minutes inland still produce the cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon that made this island valuable enough to fight wars over.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Stone Town UNESCO World Heritage Site</h4>
          <p>The maze itself is the attraction — narrow winding streets, labyrinthine alleyways, over 500 historic carved wooden doors. Arabian, Indian, Persian, European influences blend in unique architecture. House of Wonders (largest building, former sultan's palace), Old Fort (17th century Arab Fort hosting cultural events), Livingstone House (where explorer David Livingstone prepared expeditions). Free to explore on foot. Wear comfortable shoes and embrace getting lost. Half-day minimum to appreciate fully.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Spice Tour</h4>
          <p>Zanzibar's signature excursion — 30-45 min drive to spice farms where you see, smell, and taste cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper, vanilla, cardamom, ginger growing in their natural state. Portuguese introduced spices in 16th century; Zanzibar became world's major clove producer. Guides demonstrate traditional harvesting, explain medicinal uses, weave palm fronds into hats and roses. Half-day tours ~$25-40 USD. Book through ship or local operators. Educational and sensory — the air smells like a spice cabinet come to life.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Prison Island (Changuu Island)</h4>
          <p>20-minute boat ride from Stone Town. Giant Aldabra tortoises (some 100+ years old) roam freely — you can feed and photograph them. Former quarantine station, never actually used as prison. Beautiful coral beaches, snorkeling. Half-day excursion ~$20-30 USD including boat. Tortoises are patient, ancient, and utterly charming. Combine with beach time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park</h4>
          <p>Zanzibar's only national park — home to rare endemic Red Colobus monkeys found nowhere else on earth. Mangrove boardwalks, nature trails, unique flora. 45 minutes from Stone Town. ~$10 USD entry. Best visited in morning when monkeys most active. Guides required (included). The monkeys are habituated but wild — watching family groups interact in the canopy is magical. Half-day excursion.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Forodhani Gardens Evening Food Market</h4>
          <p>Waterfront park transforms nightly into open-air food festival. Grilled seafood (octopus, lobster, squid, fish), Zanzibar pizza (savory filled flatbread), sugarcane juice, fresh tropical fruit. Sunset views, local atmosphere. If ship stays late, don't miss this. Prices negotiable but very reasonable (~$5-10 for full meal). Cash only (USD or TZS). Experience authentic Zanzibar street food culture.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">The Old Dispensary</h4>
          <p>Ornate four-story building showcasing Indian architectural influence — carved wooden balconies, intricate latticework. Built 1887 by Indian merchant. Now cultural center. Small entry fee. Excellent photo opportunity and architectural detail. 15-minute visit adds cultural context to Stone Town exploration.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Stone Town is compact and best explored on foot. From port, you're immediately in historic district. Comfortable shoes essential — streets uneven coral stone.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port for spice tours, Jozani Forest, beaches. Negotiate fare before departure (no meters). Expect ~$30-50 USD for half-day hire.</li>
            <li><strong>Dalla-Dalla (Local Bus):</strong> Minibuses serving locals. Cheap but crowded and confusing for tourists. Not practical for cruise day.</li>
            <li><strong>Bicycle Rickshaws:</strong> Available in Stone Town for short distances. Negotiate price first (~$5-10 for tour).</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Most excursions (spice tour, Prison Island, Jozani) require transport. Book through ship or reputable local operators at port.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Zanzibar Pizza:</strong> Street food specialty — thin dough filled with savory (meat, cheese, vegetables) or sweet (chocolate, banana) fillings, folded and grilled. Nothing like Italian pizza but uniquely delicious. Find at Forodhani Gardens.</li>
            <li><strong>Pilau Rice:</strong> Fragrant rice cooked with cloves, cinnamon, cardamom — reflects spice island heritage. Often served with grilled fish or chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Octopus, lobster, prawns, red snapper grilled with lime and chilies. Forodhani night market is ground zero. Incredibly fresh and affordable.</li>
            <li><strong>Urojo (Zanzibar Mix):</strong> Soup-like street food with potatoes, cassava fritters, bhajia, mango, tamarind sauce. Acquired taste but culturally significant.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiced Tea &amp; Coffee:</strong> Swahili chai with cardamom, cinnamon, ginger. Coffee often spiced similarly. Served sweet and strong.</li>
            <li><strong>Tropical Fruit:</strong> Mango, papaya, pineapple, passion fruit — absurdly fresh. Try sugarcane juice at market (squeezed fresh).</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring small-denomination US Dollar bills ($1, $5, $10) for tips, market purchases, and street food. Many vendors don't have change for $20 or larger.</li>
            <li>Dress modestly in Stone Town — shoulders and knees covered. This is predominantly Muslim area; respect local customs. Beachwear only at beaches.</li>
            <li>Spice tours are Zanzibar's signature experience — prioritize this if you have limited time. The sensory immersion is unforgettable.</li>
            <li>Stone Town's streets are intentionally confusing (defensive design from centuries ago). Download maps.me offline map or hire local guide. Getting lost is part of the charm but know where your ship is docked.</li>
            <li>Bargaining expected at markets and with street vendors. Start at 50% of asking price. Smile and be friendly — it's social ritual, not combat.</li>
            <li>Forodhani Gardens food market operates evenings (sunset onward). If ship departs late afternoon/evening, this is must-do experience for authentic street food.</li>
            <li>Prison Island tortoises are gentle but ancient — don't climb on them. Bring lettuce or cabbage if allowed (check with tour operator).</li>
            <li>Jozani Forest best visited in morning when Red Colobus monkeys most active. Wear insect repellent.</li>
            <li>Photography courteous: ask permission before photographing people, especially women in traditional dress. Small tip appreciated if agreed.</li>
            <li>Water: drink only bottled water. Avoid ice unless at reputable restaurant.</li>
          </ul>
