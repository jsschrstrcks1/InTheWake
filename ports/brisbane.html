        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Quick&nbsp;Answer:</strong> Brisbane wraps you in subtropical warmth and genuine Queensland hospitality. Must-dos: stroll South Bank's riverside promenade, take a scenic river cruise departing from Cultural Centre Pontoon to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary (world's first and largest, home to 130+ koalas and 70+ native species), hand-feed free-roaming kangaroos, and experience the new Koala Close-Up encounters. Portside Wharf cruise terminal puts you minutes from all this magic.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>My Brisbane Day – A First-Person Account</h2>
        <p>I've docked at Brisbane's <strong>Portside Wharf cruise terminal</strong> half a dozen times now, and each visit feels like coming home to a friend's house where the sun always shines and the kettle's always on. The terminal sits at the river's mouth, modern and efficient, yet somehow still manages to feel unhurried — very Brisbane.</p>

        <p>My perfect Brisbane day starts with the subtropical warmth settling on my shoulders as I step off the gangway. I make straight for South Bank, where the Brisbane River curves through the city like a liquid highway of light. The <strong>Cultural Centre Pontoon</strong> is where river cruises depart, and I've learned to book the scenic cruise to Lone Pine early — it's been running for over seventy years, and for good reason.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
        <img src="img/brisbane/brisbane-2.webp" alt="Brisbane scenery" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Brisbane scenery — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Brisbane&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>The cruise upriver is its own gift — the boat glides past historic landscapes, iconic attractions, and waterfront homes that make you daydream about what it would be like to wake up to this view every morning. Jacaranda trees drape over the banks in purple cascades during spring, and the morning sun turns the water into hammered gold.</p>

        <p><strong>Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary</strong> opened in 1927 with just two koalas named Jack and Jill. Nearly a century later, it's still the world's first and largest koala sanctuary, now home to more than 130 koalas and over 70 species of Australian native wildlife spread across its grounds. Walking through the gates feels like stepping into a conservation love letter — you can feel the decades of care in every enclosure.</p>

        <p>The sanctuary's <strong>five-acre kangaroo reserve</strong> is where time slows down completely. More than 130 kangaroos roam freely here, and they're so accustomed to visitors that they barely lift their heads when you approach. I've sat cross-legged in the grass with a bag of feed pellets, surrounded by joeys and does, feeling the gentle bump of a curious roo's nose against my palm. It's meditative, this quiet communion with creatures who couldn't care less about cruise schedules or city noise.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing in the <strong>Koala Close-Up</strong> enclosure on a recent visit, I learned that the hands-on koala holds ceased in July 2024 — but this new experience is somehow better. Instead of a rushed photo op, you spend extended, meaningful time with these sleepy bundles of fur. A keeper places a koala on a low branch at eye level, and you stand close enough to see the silver tips of its ears, the way its eyes half-close in contentment, the surprisingly strong grip of its claws. It's intimate and unhurried, and the koala actually seems to enjoy the attention. Brisbane doesn't try to manufacture Instagram moments — it gives you real connection instead.
        </div>

        <p>Beyond the koalas and kangaroos, Lone Pine houses <strong>Tasmanian devils</strong>, wombats, echidnas, and even a platypus — though the platypus, true to form, is usually hiding in his burrow when I visit. The <strong>Australian sheep dog show</strong> is a marvel of training and instinct, watching border collies work with precision that borders on telepathy. The <strong>raptor free flight show</strong> is pure spectacle — wedge-tailed eagles and barn owls swooping so close overhead you can hear the whistle of their wings through the air.</p>

        <p>On my last visit, I skipped the cruise back and took a taxi to Mount Coot-tha for the sunset lookout. But most days, I'm content to amble back to South Bank, grab a cold beer at one of the riverside pubs, and watch the CityCats ferry commuters home. A XXXX Brewery tour and a steak at the historic Breakfast Creek Hotel are Brisbane classics if you have the time.</p>

        <p>The subtropical warmth wraps around you like a hug, and Queenslanders are genuinely some of the friendliest people I've met anywhere in the world. They'll strike up a conversation in the ferry queue, recommend their favorite coffee shop unprompted, and wave you off like you're an old mate. Brisbane doesn't perform hospitality — it just lives it.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p><strong>Portside Wharf</strong> serves as Brisbane's dedicated cruise terminal, positioned at the river mouth with views across Moreton Bay. It's a modern facility that handles ships of all sizes, typically offering shuttle buses into the city center or South Bank (20–30 minutes). Taxis and rideshares queue at the terminal, making the journey straightforward.</p>

        <p>Once you're in the city, the <strong>CityCat ferry system</strong> is Brisbane's secret weapon — cheap, air-conditioned, scenic, and punctual. These sleek catamarans connect all major attractions along the Brisbane River, from the University of Queensland all the way to Northshore Hamilton. Hop on at <strong>South Bank's Cultural Centre Pontoon</strong> for river cruises to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, or simply use the CityCat as your floating sightseeing platform. A day pass costs less than a museum admission and gives you unlimited river views.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details><summary>Can I still hold a koala at Lone Pine?</summary><p>As of July 1, 2024, hands-on koala holds have been replaced with the <strong>Koala Close-Up</strong> experience. This new format allows extended, meaningful time with koalas in a more intimate setting — keepers position koalas at eye level on branches, and you spend quality time observing and learning about them up close. Many visitors find this more rewarding than the old quick photo-and-done approach. Queensland remains one of few places in Australia offering close koala encounters.</p></details>
        <details><summary>What animals can I see at Lone Pine besides koalas?</summary><p>Over 70 species of Australian native wildlife call Lone Pine home, including 130+ free-roaming kangaroos in a five-acre reserve, Tasmanian devils, wombats, echidnas, platypus, and various birds of prey featured in the raptor free flight show. The Australian sheep dog demonstrations are also not to be missed.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Is South Bank Streets Beach actually nice?</summary><p>It's surprisingly great — a clean, free, man-made lagoon with lifeguards, surrounded by restaurants, parkland, and cultural venues. Perfect for families or just cooling off between exploring the Queensland Art Gallery and Queensland Museum.</p></details>
        <details><summary>How do I get to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary?</summary><p>Take a taxi or rideshare (25–30 minutes, $40–50) or book the scenic river cruise departing from South Bank's Cultural Centre Pontoon. The cruise has been running for over 70 years and passes historic landscapes, iconic attractions, and beautiful waterfront homes — it genuinely enhances the experience.</p></details>
