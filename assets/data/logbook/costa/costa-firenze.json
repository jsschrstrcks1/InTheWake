      "markdown": "**Florence sits at Tuscany's heart—and Tuscan cuisine anchors Costa Firenze's dining identity.**\n\nThe Botticelli restaurant celebrates regional ingredients. Bistecca alla fiorentina—the famous Florentine steak—appears properly prepared. Ribollita soup, pappa al pomodoro, and other Tuscan classics receive careful attention. The cuisine honors origin.\n\nTuscan wines feature prominently. Chianti from the surrounding hills. Brunello di Montalcino from southern Tuscany. Vernaccia from San Gimignano. The wine program educates while serving.\n\nOlive oil matters here. Tuscan oil differs from southern Italian varieties—peppery, green, assertive. The ship showcases regional distinctions that casual travelers might miss.\n\nFor food-focused travelers: Costa Firenze offers Tuscan culinary education through experience. Every meal connects to region, tradition, and artisanal production. The kitchen takes Florence seriously.",

      "markdown": "**Florence's museums taught the world about Renaissance art. Costa Firenze continues that educational mission at sea.**\n\nThe ship displays high-quality reproductions of Renaissance masterworks. But rather than passive decoration, the art connects to programming. Lectures explain the works. Walking tours guide passengers through the collection. Context transforms viewing into learning.\n\nThe Uffizi references honor Florence's greatest museum. The ship's cultural programming includes art history education that prestigious museums would recognize. The approach assumes passengers interested in understanding, not just seeing.\n\nDesign elements reference specific artists and periods. Brunelleschi's architectural innovations appear in structural details. Botticelli's flowing lines influence decorative choices. Michelangelo's grandeur scales throughout. The education happens continuously, whether through formal programs or simply observing the ship.\n\nFor culturally curious travelers: Costa Firenze offers Renaissance education through immersion. The ship becomes classroom where beauty teaches history.",
