## Comparison to Accessible Cruising Article

For reference, here's how the accessible cruising article does it:

**Title:**
# Accessible Cruising: Five Universal Principles for Disabled Travelers

**Dek/Subtitle:**
Five psychological principles for wheelchair users, chronic illness, autism, deaf travelers, and all disabled cruisers—from preparation to belonging.

**Pattern:** [Topic]: [Specific Framework] for [Audience]
**Then dek explains:** [What's covered] for [who specifically]—from [starting point] to [end goal]

**Applied to Cruising After Loss:**
- Topic: Cruising After Loss
- Framework: When Grief Needs Water (poetic, not structural—that's okay)
- Audience: Widows, widowers, bereaved
- Dek should explain: What's covered (timing, triggers, community, permission) for who (widows/widowers) navigating what (first cruises after loss)

This is why **Option 1** matches the established pattern best.
