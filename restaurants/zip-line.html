                        <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The zip line is a free thrill ride on Oasis and Icon Class ships, launching from Deck 16 and soaring 82 feet across the Boardwalk neighborhood. No reservation needed—just walk up during operating hours, meet the weight requirements (75-275 lbs), and fly. Best times: early morning or during dinner for shorter waits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <section class="overview" id="overview">
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Spanning the open-air Boardwalk neighborhood, Royal Caribbean's zip line delivers an exhilarating rush as you soar nine decks above sea level. The 82-foot journey takes you from a launch platform on Deck 16 to a landing zone on Deck 15, passing directly over the vintage carousel, Johnny Rockets, and other Boardwalk attractions below.</p>

                        <p>What makes this zip line unique is the setting—you're not zipping through a forest or over a canyon, but across a bustling ship neighborhood with the ocean stretching endlessly beyond. Spectators below often cheer as riders zoom overhead, adding to the excitement.</p>

                        <h3>The Experience</h3>
                        <p>After climbing to the launch platform and getting harnessed in, you'll step up to the edge and wait for your signal. Then you launch—gravity takes over as you accelerate across the Boardwalk. The ride lasts only about 10-15 seconds, but the combination of height, speed, and ocean views makes every moment count.</p>

                        <h3>Two Parallel Lines</h3>
                        <p>Oasis Class ships feature two parallel zip lines, allowing friends or family to race side by side. This dual setup also helps reduce wait times as two riders can go simultaneously.</p>

                            <h3>Is the zip line free on Royal Caribbean?</h3>
                            <p>Yes, the zip line is completely complimentary and included with your cruise fare. You can ride as many times as you want throughout your cruise at no extra charge.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How long is the Royal Caribbean zip line?</h3>
                            <p>The zip line spans approximately 82 feet (25 meters) across the Boardwalk neighborhood, launching from Deck 16 and landing on Deck 15.</p>

                            <h3>What is the age and weight limit for the zip line?</h3>
                            <p>Riders must weigh between 75-275 lbs (34-125 kg). There's no minimum age as long as the child meets the weight requirement and can be properly fitted in the harness.</p>

                            <h3>Which Royal Caribbean ships have a zip line?</h3>
                            <p>The zip line is available on all Oasis Class ships (Oasis, Allure, Harmony, Symphony, and Wonder of the Seas) and Icon Class ships (Icon of the Seas).</p>

                            <p>Yes! Oasis Class ships have two parallel zip lines, so you can ride side-by-side with a friend or family member. It's a popular way to share the experience.</p>

                            <p>That depends on your comfort with heights! The launch platform is high above the Boardwalk and stepping off requires a leap of faith. Once you're zipping, most people find the fear transforms into exhilaration. Staff are supportive of nervous riders.</p>
