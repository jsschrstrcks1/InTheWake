      <h3>Alchemy Bar Review: Carnival's Best-Kept Cocktail Secret</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Alchemy Bar is Carnival's craft cocktail lounge — a pharmacy-themed bar where bartenders mix drinks with house-made syrups, bitters, and tinctures. It's the most sophisticated drinking experience on any Carnival ship, tucked away from the pool deck chaos. Drinks are covered under the Cheers! beverage package or priced individually ($12-16 range).</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The cocktail menu is organized by "prescriptions" — each drink designed to cure a fictional ailment. The Cucumber Sunrise (vodka, elderflower, muddled cucumber) is crisp and refreshing — the go-to for hot port days. The Spiced Fig Old Fashioned is the bartenders' pride: bourbon, fig syrup, smoked cinnamon, a proper orange peel. It's genuinely craft-bar quality. The Jalapeño Margarita brings real heat — not gimmicky, actually spicy. Where it falls short: some of the sweeter "prescriptions" lean too far into novelty territory — the Cotton Candy cocktail tastes like a melted Jolly Rancher. If you're a whiskey or gin person, ask the bartender to go off-menu; they're skilled enough to make a proper Negroni or Manhattan even though neither appears on the card. Draft beer is available but defeats the purpose of coming here.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The bartenders at Alchemy Bar are Carnival's best. They're trained specifically for this venue and take pride in the craft — they'll walk you through the menu, recommend based on your palate, and remember your drink by Night 3. Speed is the tradeoff: these aren't poured-from-a-gun drinks, so expect 3-5 minutes per cocktail during peak hours (9-11 p.m.). Worth the wait. Seating is limited — 20-30 seats on most ships — and there's no reservation system, so arriving by 8:30 p.m. secures a stool.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The pharmacy theme is surprisingly well-executed — apothecary bottles, vintage medical equipment, warm amber lighting. It feels like a prohibition-era speakeasy, not a cruise ship bar. The music is low enough for conversation, and the crowd tends to be adults who actively chose this over the louder pool bar. On ships with the bar positioned near the casino, noise bleed can be an issue. On Mardi Gras and Celebration, it's better isolated.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Alchemy Bar is the best bar on any Carnival ship, full stop. The Spiced Fig Old Fashioned and Cucumber Sunrise are worth seeking out, and the bartenders are genuinely talented. It loses points for limited seating, the occasional too-sweet novelty drink, and the fact that it's always crowded by 9 p.m. <em>Tip:</em> go at 5 p.m. on embarkation day — everyone else is still at the Lido, and you'll have the bartender's full attention.</p>
