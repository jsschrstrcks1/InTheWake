        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I woke to the captain's announcement crackling through the cabin speaker: "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a window." Around Cape Horn, those five words carry more weight than anywhere else on earth—the convergence of Pacific and Atlantic creates weather that has killed ten thousand sailors and swallowed eight hundred ships. The Drake Passage had tossed us for two days, waves crashing against the bridge deck, passengers gripping handrails and turning green. Now, inexplicably, the ocean lay flat as a mirror, and we were going ashore to the end of the world.</p>

            <p>The Zodiac ride from ship to shore took only fifteen minutes, every second felt with intense awareness. The inflatable boat bounced over residual swells, spray coating waterproof jackets, the cold Chilean air biting at exposed cheeks. Our expedition leader pointed ahead: Horn Island rising from the sea like a giant's shoulder blade, green slopes topped with gray rock, clouds streaming past the summit like smoke from a volcano. The air carried sea salt mixing with something earthier—the tundra vegetation, perhaps, or simply the scent of land after days of open ocean.</p>

            <p>The landing beach was a narrow strip of rocks and kelp, waves lapping with surprising gentleness. Expedition staff in dry suits waded into the water to help us ashore, and I stepped from Zodiac to boulder with my heart pounding. This was real. I was standing at 55°58' South, further from home than I had ever been, at a place I had dreamed of reaching since first reading about it in sailing books three decades ago. However, no photograph had prepared me for the wind—constant, relentless, pushing at my body as if the island itself wanted me to leave.</p>

            <p>The wooden stairs climbing from beach to memorial plateau numbered exactly 127 steps. I counted them, partly to occupy my mind, partly to fix this moment in memory. Each step brought me closer to something I struggled to name—not quite a destination, more like a reckoning. At the top, the famous albatross sculpture cut a bird-shaped hole in the gray sky, wings spread wide in eternal flight, a memorial to the mariners who died rounding the Horn before the Panama Canal made it optional. The wind howled through the metal cutout, creating a mournful sound that raised the hair on my arms.</p>

            <p>I stood before that sculpture for several minutes, reading the poem etched at its base. It speaks of albatross souls carrying fallen sailors home. The wind stung my eyes, and I found myself weeping—not from cold alone, but from the accumulated weight of history pressing against my chest. My breath caught as I tried to comprehend how many mothers had lost sons here, how many wives had waited for ships that never returned, how many children had grown up with only stories of fathers swallowed by the Horn. The memorial honors the estimated ten thousand souls who perished, but numbers feel inadequate. Each one was a person with hopes and fears, sailing into waters they knew might kill them.</p>

            <p>The Chilean navy lighthouse keeper emerged from his small station to stamp our passports. He lives on this lonely island with his family, rotating duty every year, maintaining the light that guides modern ships safely past. His signature and the official Cape Horn stamp transformed an ordinary passport into a souvenir more precious than any purchased treasure. Through our expedition guide translating, someone asked what it was like to live at the end of the world. He smiled and said something about the wind being a companion once you stopped fighting it. The cost of this stamp was nothing in dollars but everything in meaning.</p>

            <p>Walking back toward the stairs, I passed the small Stella Maris chapel—white walls, wooden cross, a refuge for prayer at the edge of habitation. Inside, a logbook held signatures of visitors stretching back decades, and I added my name with a shaking hand. The chapel smelled of old wood and candle wax, a pocket of stillness amid the eternal wind. Through the window, I could see our ship anchored in the bay, looking impossibly small against the gray immensity of ocean and sky.</p>

            <p>The return Zodiac ride felt different—not anxious anticipation but profound gratitude. Our expedition leader told us that only about thirty percent of cruise attempts result in successful landings, though statistics feel irrelevant when you've stood on that sacred ground. I looked back at Horn Island retreating into the mist and understood something about pilgrimage. Nevertheless, this place exists not for tourists but for the sailors it remembers, and we who visit are merely permitted to witness. The sea could close again tomorrow—it often does—and the albatross would stand guard alone.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing at the memorial, wind tearing at my jacket, tears streaming down my face, comprehending for the first time what it meant to sail these waters in wooden ships with no weather forecasts and no rescue. My heart ached with something like grief for strangers I never knew—young men who set out from ports in England and Spain and Portugal, rounding this cape because the world's cargo demanded it, dying because the sea is indifferent to human courage. That ache hasn't left me. I don't think I want it to.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Cape Horn taught me that some places are not meant to be comfortable. They exist to remind us of limits—the limits of human ambition against natural forces, the limits of memory against time, the limits of what we can understand about those who came before. What I learned here will stay forever: that reaching the end of something is really just finding a new beginning, and that gratitude for safe passage is the only appropriate response to standing where so many never could.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cape Horn is not a traditional cruise port but an expedition landing site. Ships anchor in protected waters near Horn Island and deploy Zodiacs for wet landings on a rocky beach. Landing operations depend entirely on weather—wind speeds below 30 knots and manageable swell are required. When conditions permit, landings typically last 60-90 minutes total.</p>

            <p>No facilities exist for passengers on Horn Island. The Chilean navy maintains a lighthouse station where the keeper will stamp passports (free of charge). There is no currency needed, no shopping, no restaurants—only the memorial, chapel, and lighthouse. All passengers who land receive the official Cape Horn stamp as verification of the achievement. Accessibility is limited; the landing requires stepping from Zodiac to rocks, and 127 stairs lead to the memorial. Expedition staff assess conditions and individual capability before each landing. Wheelchair access is not available.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Horn Island measures only about 6 kilometers across, and visitor movement is restricted to a small area near the landing beach. There is no "getting around" in the traditional sense—no transportation, no roads, no vehicles. Everything you will see is accessed on foot from the landing point.</p>

            <p><strong>The Landing:</strong> Zodiacs from your ship beach on rocks at the island's small landing site. Expedition staff in dry suits assist passengers stepping from boat to shore. Expect to get your feet wet—waterproof boots essential. The beach consists of rounded rocks and kelp; footing can be slippery. No charge for the Zodiac transfer; it's included in ship excursion pricing.</p>

            <p><strong>Stairs to Memorial:</strong> A wooden staircase of 127 steps climbs from beach to the plateau where the albatross memorial stands. The ascent takes 10-15 minutes at a careful pace. Handrails exist but the wind makes climbing challenging. Moderate stamina required; high winds can make the climb difficult for those with balance issues. Not wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <p><strong>The Plateau:</strong> Once atop the stairs, the memorial area is relatively flat. You can walk between the albatross sculpture, the lighthouse station, and the Stella Maris chapel within a few minutes. Total time ashore typically 45-60 minutes once the entire group has landed. Low stamina sufficient for plateau exploration once you've climbed the stairs.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cape Horn presents significant accessibility challenges. The Zodiac wet landing, rocky beach, and steep stairs make this unsuitable for wheelchair users or those with significant mobility limitations. Expedition staff will assess individual capability before permitting landing. Those who cannot safely land can still experience the ship sailing past the cape—a meaningful achievement in itself. Book ahead with your expedition line to discuss mobility needs; independent exploration is not possible here.</p>

        <details class="port-section excursions" open>
          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Cape Horn offers no independent excursion options—all landings are managed by your expedition ship. The experience is included in your cruise fare. Ship excursion is mandatory here; you cannot book ahead with independent operators or arrange your own Zodiac transfer. The guaranteed return to ship is inherent in the expedition model.</p>

            <h3>The Cape Horn Landing</h3>
            <p>Weather permitting, all passengers who can safely complete the wet landing and stair climb are invited to go ashore. Expedition staff brief passengers on safety protocols, proper clothing, and what to expect. Zodiacs shuttle passengers in groups of 8-12. Once ashore, you have approximately 45-60 minutes to explore the memorial area, visit the chapel, receive your passport stamp from the lighthouse keeper, and photograph the albatross sculpture. No additional cost beyond cruise fare—this is included in all Antarctic and Patagonian expedition itineraries that include Cape Horn. Moderate stamina required for the 127-step climb; balance and mobility essential for the wet landing. Limited accessibility; not suitable for wheelchairs or those with significant mobility challenges.</p>

            <h3>Scenic Sailing (When Landing Impossible)</h3>
            <p>If weather prevents landing—which happens 50-75% of attempts—your ship will sail as close as safely possible to Horn Island. Captains typically circle to give all passengers views from various angles. The dramatic cliffs, the lighthouse, the albatross sculpture silhouetted against the sky—all visible from deck. Onboard naturalists provide narration about the cape's history and significance. Many passengers consider this experience meaningful even without stepping ashore. Rounding the Horn by ship carries its own maritime significance. Free; included in cruise. Low stamina—simply viewing from deck. Fully accessible for all mobility levels.</p>

            <h3>Capturing the Moment</h3>
            <p>Time ashore is limited, so plan your shots in advance. The albatross sculpture against the sky is the iconic image—position yourself quickly after climbing the stairs. Bring a waterproof camera bag; spray on the Zodiac ride can damage equipment. The lighthouse and chapel make excellent secondary subjects. Portrait-style shots with the memorial in background are popular. Consider bringing a polarizing filter to cut glare from the gray sky. Protect your camera from the constant wind and cold. No additional cost; independent activity within the landing timeframe. Low stamina for photography itself, though reaching the site requires moderate stamina.</p>

            <h3>Lighthouse Visit and Passport Stamp</h3>
            <p>The Chilean navy lighthouse keeper welcomes visitors to the station and provides the official Cape Horn passport stamp—free of charge. This stamp verifies your presence at one of the world's most significant maritime waypoints. Some visitors bring additional items for stamping (journals, postcards). The keeper and family are happy to pose for photos but appreciate respectful interaction. A brief exchange through your expedition guide's translation offers insight into life at the end of the world. Free; passport stamp included. Low stamina; the lighthouse is steps from the albatross memorial on the plateau.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->
        <details class="port-section depth-soundings" open>
          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Cape Horn's significance is written in the maritime ledgers of history—ten thousand dead, eight hundred ships lost, uncounted dreams swallowed by the convergence of two great oceans. Before the Panama Canal opened in 1914, every vessel sailing between Atlantic and Pacific had to round this cape. The alternative—the Strait of Magellan—was marginally safer but required skilled pilotage through treacherous narrows. For most sailing ships, the Horn was inevitable and often fatal.</p>

            <p>The geography creates the danger. Here, the Drake Passage compresses between Antarctica and South America, funneling the circumpolar current and its accompanying weather systems through a narrow gap. Waves build to heights of twenty meters in storms. Winds routinely exceed hurricane force. The sailing ships of the 19th century could spend weeks trying to round the cape, beating against westerly gales, losing crew to cold and exhaustion, sometimes failing entirely and retreating to repair in the Falklands before trying again.</p>

            <p>The albatross memorial, erected in 1992 by the Chilean navy, honors those who perished. The sculptor chose the albatross because sailors believed these birds carried the souls of drowned mariners. The poem at the base, written by Chilean poet Sara Vial, speaks of eternal flight and final rest. Reading it in the constant wind, surrounded by the gray immensity of sea and sky, one understands why this place demands reverence rather than tourism.</p>

            <p>Today, modern ships equipped with stabilizers and accurate weather forecasting navigate these waters safely—but they navigate them quickly, minimizing exposure. The lighthouse keeper maintains the light that guides vessels around the rocks, continuing a legacy of human presence at the edge of habitation. Each year, a new family volunteers for duty, spending twelve months in isolation on this windy plateau. They are the last inhabitants of the end of the world.</p>

              <summary>How long do we spend on the island?</summary>
              <p>When weather permits landing, total time ashore is typically 45-60 minutes per passenger. This includes the Zodiac transfer, the climb to the memorial, time at the albatross sculpture and chapel, passport stamping, and return. The entire landing operation for a ship of 200 passengers can take 3-4 hours including all Zodiac rotations.</p>

              <summary>Can I visit Cape Horn independently?</summary>
              <p>No. Cape Horn is accessible only via expedition cruise ships or private yacht. No commercial flights serve Horn Island, and no independent ferry or boat service exists. The only way to reach the island is on an organized expedition that includes Zodiac landing capabilities and Chilean maritime permits.</p>
