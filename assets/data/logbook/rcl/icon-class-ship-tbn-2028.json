      "markdown": "**Royal Caribbean's fourth Icon-class vessel continues the revolutionary design that redefined mega-ship cruising—with potential for new deployment patterns.**\n\nBy 2028, Icon class will have established itself across multiple ships: [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html), [Star of the Seas](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html), and the 2027 vessel. Each demonstrated the class's core strengths: neighborhood organization, LNG environmental technology, AquaDome entertainment, and Category 6 waterpark excellence.\n\nThis fourth vessel arrives with operational lessons from three predecessors. Expect refinements in traffic flow, entertainment programming, and dining options based on guest feedback from earlier ships.\n\nDeployment possibilities expand with each new Icon. While early vessels focus on Caribbean homeports, additional capacity creates opportunities for seasonal repositioning or new regional markets.\n\nFor travelers anticipating this 2028 launch: the Icon formula is proven. What remains to discover is how Royal Caribbean will differentiate this vessel's identity within the class.",

      "markdown": "**If you're considering an Icon-class ship for your first cruise, understanding the class helps you know what to expect—and whether it suits your travel style.**\n\nIcon class ships are the largest cruise ships ever built, carrying approximately 7,600 guests at maximum capacity. They're organized into eight distinct neighborhoods—each with its own personality, dining, and entertainment.\n\nKey features across the class:\n\n**The AquaDome** transforms from daytime lounge to evening entertainment venue with acrobatics and water shows.\n\n**Category 6** offers the tallest waterslides at sea, including family and adult-focused options.\n\n**Surfside** provides a dedicated family neighborhood with kid-focused amenities.\n\n**The Hideaway** offers adults-only retreat with suspended deck and plunge pools.\n\n**Central Park** brings real trees and plants to sea—a green oasis mid-ship.\n\nIcon class works best for travelers who want variety and don't mind scale. If you prefer intimate ships or destination-focused cruising, consider [Radiance class](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) or [Vision class](/ships/rcl/legend-of-the-seas.html) instead.\n\nFor first-timers attracted to \"biggest and newest\": Icon class delivers on that promise.",
