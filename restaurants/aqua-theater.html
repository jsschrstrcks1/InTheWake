      <h4>Aqua80s</h4>
      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Ships: Various Oasis Class · Runtime: ~35 minutes</p>
      <p>A totally tubular tribute to the 1980s featuring high-energy diving, synchronized swimming, and acrobatics set to classic 80s hits. Think neon, leg warmers, and power ballads combined with jaw-dropping athletic performances. The show captures the fun, over-the-top spirit of the decade.</p>

        <summary><strong>Guest Review</strong> — 4.5 ★</summary>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-top:.5rem;"><em>Harmony of the Seas, August 2024</em></p>
        <p>"Aqua80s was such a blast! The divers are incredible athletes — watching them launch from the highest platform while 'Take On Me' plays is surreal. The synchronized swimmers added beautiful choreography, and the whole show had infectious energy. My kids (and honestly, us adults) were dancing in our seats."</p>

      <h4>OceanAria</h4>
      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Ships: Select Oasis Class · Runtime: ~40 minutes</p>
      <p>A more dramatic, theatrical production that tells a story through diving and aquatic performance. OceanAria combines classical music, opera-style vocals, and stunning choreography to create an emotional journey. The high dives become dramatic story beats rather than just athletic feats.</p>
      <details class="show-review">
        <summary><strong>Guest Review</strong> — 4.7 ★</summary>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-top:.5rem;"><em>Symphony of the Seas, October 2024</em></p>
        <p>"OceanAria was genuinely moving. The combination of live vocals, orchestral music, and athletic performance created something artistic rather than just entertaining. When the lead diver performed her final dive as the soprano hit the climax — goosebumps. This is the kind of show that elevates cruise entertainment."</p>

      <h4>HiRO</h4>
      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Ships: Wonder of the Seas, Icon of the Seas · Runtime: ~30 minutes</p>
      <p>A superhero-themed aquatic adventure following a young hero discovering their powers. Combines comedy, diving, acrobatics, and special effects. More family-oriented with clear characters and storyline that kids can follow, while the athletic performances impress adults.</p>
      <details class="show-review">
        <summary><strong>Guest Review</strong> — 4.3 ★</summary>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-top:.5rem;"><em>Wonder of the Seas, July 2024</em></p>
        <p>"HiRO was perfect for our family cruise. My 6-year-old was captivated by the story, cheering for the hero. The diving is still spectacular — there's a sequence where three divers launch simultaneously that got huge applause. Lighter than OceanAria but thoroughly entertaining."</p>

      <h3>AquaTheater Review: Diving Into the Impossible</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> I've seen Cirque du Soleil, Olympic diving, and Vegas spectacles. AquaTheater still managed to impress me. There's something about watching world-class athletes perform against the backdrop of the actual ocean that creates magic no land-based venue can match.</p>

      <h4>The Setting</h4>
      <p>AquaTheater's location at the stern of the ship is genius. As darkness falls and the show begins, you're looking at performers silhouetted against the ship's wake and the horizon. The stars come out, the fountains light up, and suddenly you're in this impossible outdoor theater floating in the middle of the ocean.</p>

      <h4>The Performances</h4>
      <p>The divers are genuinely elite athletes — many have competed at collegiate or international levels. Watching them launch from the 10-meter platform, execute complex maneuvers, and enter the water cleanly while the ship is moving is remarkable. The synchronized swimmers add grace and artistry, and the combination of athletic prowess with theatrical storytelling elevates everything.</p>

      <h4>The Technical Achievement</h4>
      <p>Consider what Royal Caribbean engineered here: a pool that can transform into a stage, dive platforms that can retract, fountains precisely synchronized to music, all on a moving ship in the middle of the ocean. The lighting design makes the water glow and sparkle. It's a technical marvel that most guests don't fully appreciate.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>AquaTheater is a must-see on any Oasis Class cruise. <strong>Rating: 4.6/5.</strong> See the evening show for full effect — the lighting and atmosphere are worth waiting for. Arrive early, grab a seat in the center sections, and prepare to be amazed. It's the kind of experience that reminds you why you cruise on ships this size.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>What is AquaTheater on Royal Caribbean?</strong></summary>
        <p>AquaTheater is Royal Caribbean's outdoor amphitheater exclusive to Oasis Class ships. Located at the stern with the ocean as backdrop, it features a 5,000+ square foot pool stage with high-dive platforms reaching over 10 meters, synchronized fountains, and seating for approximately 600 guests.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Are AquaTheater shows free?</strong></summary>
        <p>Yes, all AquaTheater performances are complimentary and included in your cruise fare. Shows typically run 25-40 minutes and feature professional divers, acrobats, and synchronized swimmers. No reservations required.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>What happens if it rains?</strong></summary>
        <p>AquaTheater shows may be cancelled in rain or rough seas — diving from height on a moving ship in bad weather is unsafe. The ship will announce cancellations, and sometimes rescheduled shows are offered. This is one reason to attend early in your cruise if weather permits.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Will I get wet in the front row?</strong></summary>
        <p>Possibly! Some shows include moments where water splashes toward the audience, particularly in the front rows. Kids typically love this. If you prefer to stay dry, choose seats a few rows back.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Can you swim in the AquaTheater pool?</strong></summary>
        <p>During daytime hours when no shows are scheduled, the AquaTheater pool is sometimes open for swimming. Availability varies by ship and sailing — check with Guest Services or your Cruise Compass.</p>
