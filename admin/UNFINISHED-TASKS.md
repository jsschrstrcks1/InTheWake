## Homepage Improvement Initiative

**Context:** Analytics show heavy bounce rates from homepage and tool pages. ChatGPT audit identified missing intent-based navigation and tool prominence issues.

### Goals
- Reduce homepage bounce by helping visitors route faster
- Elevate interactive tools above content cards
- Create soft cross-links from tool pages to reduce dead-end visits
- Maintain calm, trust-first brand voice (no urgency-driven CTAs)

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Add intent selector ("What are you planning?") | DONE | HIGH |
| Create Planning Tools row (Ship Quiz, Drink Calculator, Stateroom Check, Packing Lists) | DONE | HIGH |
| Reduce explore grid from 10 cards to 6 | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Update trust line (remove "no affiliate links" - Amazon affiliate coming) | DONE | HIGH |
| Add Related Resources to Drink Calculator | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Add Related Resources to Ship Quiz | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Add Related Resources to Stateroom Check | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Add Related Resources to Packing Lists | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Replace placeholder Key Facts with Site Highlights + Search | DONE | MEDIUM |
| Standardize trust badge site-wide (958 pages) | DONE | HIGH |

### Design Principles
- Intent-based routing: "What are you planning?" not "Here's everything"
- Tools visually distinct from content cards
- No urgency language ("Don't miss out!") - keep trust-first voice
- Light touch on faith angle - findable but unobtrusive
- Acknowledge Royal Caribbean focus (for now)
