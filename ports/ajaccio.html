    <article class="card"><h1>Ajaccio: My Corsican Adventure</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Our ship dropped anchor in the sapphire bay this morning – Ajaccio is a tender port, so we rode the small boats in, watching the 16th-century Genoese citadel rise golden above the harbor, still in military use after all these centuries. The moment I stepped ashore, I understood why Napoleon carried this island in his heart: the air smells of maquis and espresso, that honey-sweet scrub that carpets the mountains in wild thyme, rosemary, and juniper.</p>

        <p>We walked straight into Napoleon's world. The man was born here on August 15, 1769 – remarkably, just one year after Corsica passed from Genoa to France – and you cannot take three steps in Ajaccio without stumbling into his legend. At Place Foch, his bronze statue stands dressed as a Roman consul, flanked by his four brothers, gazing out over the harbor. Later we climbed to Place d'Austerlitz, known locally as Place du Casone, where a 1938 monument shows Napoleon crowned by eagles, surveying his birthplace from a hillside of Mediterranean pines.</p>

      </figure>

        <p>But the real treasure is Maison Bonaparte. The Bonaparte family lived in this house since 1682, and walking through those rooms – small, warm, surprisingly intimate – I could feel the future emperor growing up here, running down these very stairs. In the 1960s, the family gave the house to the French government, and now it stands as a national museum, preserved like a reliquary. The guide told us Napoleon's mother, Letizia, gave birth to him in an upstairs room on August 15, and I stood there imagining that summer day, the windows open to the Mediterranean breeze, history arriving in swaddling clothes.</p>

        <p>We spent the afternoon at the Palais Fesch Museum – an absolute revelation. Cardinal Fesch was Napoleon's uncle, and his collection of Italian paintings is second only to the Louvre. Room after room of Botticelli, Titian, Veronese – I lost myself in the luminous faces and golden backgrounds, the kind of art that stops time. Afterward, we ducked into Notre Dame Cathedral, a Baroque beauty where Napoleon himself was baptized. The interior glows with marble and gilt, and I stood before works by Tintoretto and Delacroix, humbled by how much beauty this small island city holds.</p>

        <p>The market that morning was an opera of Corsican flavors. We filled our bag with brocciu cheese – fresh, creamy, utterly unlike anything you find on the mainland – along with slices of coppa and prisuttu, the island's exquisite dry-cured ham, fragrant with mountain herbs. The vendor handed us samples with a smile and a shrug, as if to say, "This is just how we eat here." We sat on a bench in the old town, eating our charcuterie with crusty bread, watching old men play pétanque under the shade of plane trees, their voices rising and falling in melodic Corsican French.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon, we walked ten minutes from the port to Plage Saint-Francois, the closest beach, where locals swim and sunbathe with an ease that made us feel instantly welcome. But the next day we rented a car and drove up the coast to Plage de Capo di Feno – wild, windswept, untouched – and the water was that impossible Corsican blue-green, the kind of color that doesn't look real in photographs. We had lunch at a paillote beach shack: charcoal-grilled fresh fish, a carafe of chilled rosé, waves crashing ten feet away. The local Pietra beer, brewed with Corsican chestnut flour, tasted like the island itself – earthy, unique, unforgettable.</p>

        <p>On our last evening, a local told us about the August 15 celebration – Napoleon's birthday – when the whole town erupts in parades, military re-enactments, and fireworks. I imagined the streets filled with music and pageantry, the harbor lit by rockets, the island celebrating its most famous son with the kind of joy that only comes from deep pride.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Floating in the warm sea at Capo di Feno with the scent of maquis drifting off the mountains, the citadel glowing in the distance, and realizing that Corsica really is the most beautiful island I have ever seen – wild, proud, and utterly its own.

        <h3>Getting Around Ajaccio</h3>
        <p>Ajaccio is a tender port – cruise ships anchor in the magnificent bay and ferry passengers ashore on small boats. The tender ride itself is lovely, offering views of the citadel and mountains as you approach. Once ashore, the old town is completely walkable: Maison Bonaparte, the cathedral, Place Foch, and the market are all within easy strolling distance. Plage Saint-Francois is a pleasant ten-minute walk from the port if you want a quick swim.</p>

      </figure>

        <p>For the wild beaches like Capo di Feno or the dramatic coastal roads, rent a car – the scenery is spectacular, though the roads are winding and narrow. Corsican drivers know every curve by heart, so don't feel rushed; pull over and let them pass. The journey truly is the destination here.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p><strong>Tender Port:</strong> Ships anchor in the bay rather than docking. Tender wait times vary, so plan accordingly – early morning or late afternoon tend to be less crowded.</p>
        <p><strong>August 15 Festivities:</strong> If you visit on Napoleon's birthday, expect parades, military re-enactments, and celebrations throughout the city. It's wonderful to witness, but restaurants and museums may have altered hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Corsican Cuisine:</strong> Don't leave without trying brocciu cheese, coppa, and prisuttu (Corsican ham). The morning market near the port is the best place to sample and buy local specialties.</p>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> French is the official language, but you'll hear Corsican spoken among locals. A few words of French go a long way, and the islanders appreciate the effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Driving:</strong> If you rent a car, Corsican roads are narrow, winding, and dramatic. Drive slowly, enjoy the views, and don't be shy about using turnouts to let faster locals pass.</p>
