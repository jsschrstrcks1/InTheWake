      <h1>Mazatlán: Where Colonial Mexico Meets the Pacific Sunset</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>Mazatlán surprised me. I expected another Mexican beach resort, generic and interchangeable. Instead, I found a 19th-century port city with cobblestone streets, a beautifully restored historic center, and a malecón that stretches for miles along the Pacific. This is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, and while the Golden Zone caters to tourists, the Centro Histórico keeps it real.</p>

        <p>The city's dual personality works in your favor. Want all-inclusive resort vibes, beach clubs, and Corona by the pool? The Golden Zone delivers. Want colonial architecture, serious Mexican cuisine, and cliff divers? Centro Histórico awaits. Most cruise passengers never leave the Golden Zone, which means the historic center rewards those who make the effort.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Changed My Mind:</strong> I was wandering the Centro Histórico as the afternoon light turned golden, and I stumbled into the Ángela Peralta Theater – a 19th-century opera house restored to its original glory. A band was rehearsing for a local wedding. The acoustics were perfect. I sat in a velvet seat and listened for an hour. No cruise itinerary could have planned that.

        <h2>Centro Histórico</h2>
        <p>Mazatlán's historic center underwent a remarkable restoration starting in the 1990s, and it shows. The Plazuela Machado anchors the neighborhood – cafes ring the square, the cathedral rises nearby, and the surrounding streets are lined with galleries, restaurants, and converted colonial buildings. It feels like Mexico was supposed to feel.</p>
        <p>The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception dominates the skyline with its twin yellow towers. Inside, the vaulted ceilings and religious art date from 1899. The Angela Peralta Theater, named for a beloved opera singer, hosts concerts and events in a stunning 19th-century venue.</p>
        <p>Don't miss the municipal market (Mercado Pino Suárez) for an authentic local experience. Fresh produce, seafood, flowers, and prepared foods at prices that remind you this isn't a tourist attraction – it's where locals shop.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>El Faro and the Cliff Divers</h2>
        <p>El Faro Mazatlán sits atop Cerro del Creston – at 157 meters above sea level, it's one of the highest lighthouses in the world. The hike takes about 30 minutes and rewards with panoramic views of the city, the port, and the Pacific. Go early morning to avoid the heat.</p>
        <p>The cliff divers at El Mirador perform daily, launching themselves from 50-foot rocks into the churning Pacific below. It's more intimate than Acapulco's famous divers, often just a few tourists watching something genuinely death-defying. Tips are expected and deserved – these aren't professional divers, just incredibly brave locals.</p>
        <p>The malecón connecting these areas is itself an attraction – over 5 miles of waterfront promenade with sculptures, monuments, and endless Pacific views. Rent a bike or take the pulmonia (open-air taxi) to cover more ground.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Golden Zone Beaches</h2>
        <p>The Zona Dorada (Golden Zone) is tourist Mexico incarnate – high-rise hotels, beach bars, all-inclusives, and vendors selling everything. The beaches themselves are beautiful: wide, sandy, with reasonable waves for bodyboarding. Playa Gaviotas is the main stretch.</p>
        <p>For a day of lounging, the beach club scene is well-developed. Joe's Oyster Bar and the various resort day passes offer pools, loungers, and all-you-can-drink packages. It's not authentic Mexico, but it's fun Mexico.</p>
        <p>Stone Island (Isla de la Piedra) is a quick panga boat ride from the Golden Zone. The beach is less developed, the seafood shacks more local, and the pace slower. Horseback riding along the sand is popular, and snorkeling and boogie boarding keep active visitors busy. It's the relaxed alternative to the main tourist strip. For beer lovers, Pacifico brewery tours offer a taste of Mazatlán's famous export.</p>

        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Mazatlán safe for tourists?</summary><p>The tourist areas – Centro Histórico, Golden Zone, malecón – are generally safe. Use normal precautions. Mazatlán has worked hard to remain a safe destination for visitors.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's the best thing to eat in Mazatlán?</summary><p>Seafood, obviously – aguachile, ceviche, whole fried fish. Mazatlán is also known for carnitas (slow-cooked pork) and smoked marlin tacos. Skip the chain restaurants; eat where locals eat.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is the lighthouse hike difficult?</summary><p>Moderate – about 30 minutes uphill on paved paths. Wear good shoes, bring water, and start early to avoid the heat. The views are worth the effort.</p></details>

        <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
        <p><strong>Mazatlán</strong> offers the best of both worlds – Golden Zone beach resort vibes and an authentically restored Centro Histórico with colonial architecture, cliff divers, and the world's highest operating lighthouse. Skip the tourist zone at least briefly and discover why Mexicans have vacationed here for 150 years.</p>
