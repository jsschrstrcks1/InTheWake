      "markdown": "**Harmony of the Seas is the third Oasis-class ship, launched in 2016.**\n\nIt's not the original ([Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), 2009). It's not the newest ([Wonder](/ships/rcl/wonder-of-the-seas.html), 2022). But Harmony occupies a sweet spot: it has everything that makes Oasis class great\u2014seven neighborhoods, Central Park, the Boardwalk, 20+ dining venues, Broadway-quality shows\u2014with refinements [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) learned from operating Oasis and [Allure](/ships/rcl/allure-of-the-seas.html) for years.\n\nHarmony added features Oasis didn't have: waterslides (The Perfect Storm trio\u2014Typhoon, Cyclone, Supercell), the Ultimate Abyss (a ten-deck dry slide that's equal parts terrifying and exhilarating), Splashaway Bay (a kids' aqua park), the Bionic Bar (robotic bartenders), and enhanced stateroom designs. It's still 226,963 gross tons, still carries about 5,400+ guests at double occupancy, still organized around the same neighborhood layout\u2014but it feels more polished than the originals.\n\nThe seven neighborhoods remain: Central Park (real trees, open-air serenity), the Boardwalk (carousel, shops, outdoor energy), Pool and Sports Zone, Royal Promenade (indoor shopping street), Vitality at Sea Spa and Fitness, Entertainment Place, and Youth Zone. If you've sailed [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), Harmony will feel instantly familiar\u2014same blueprint, better execution.\n\nIf you've never sailed Oasis class, Harmony is an excellent introduction: you're getting the neighborhood concept with modern refinements but not paying the premium for the absolute newest ship ([Wonder](/ships/rcl/wonder-of-the-seas.html) or [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html)).",

      "markdown": "**The Ultimate Abyss is a thrill-seeker's dream.** It's a ten-deck dry slide that spirals from Deck 16 to Deck 6. You slide down in near-darkness with lights and sound effects. It's fast, disorienting, and genuinely fun. If you've got adrenaline-seeking kids (or adults), this alone is a highlight. (Pro tip: go early in the cruise before word spreads and lines form.)\n\n**The Perfect Storm waterslides add variety.** Typhoon and Cyclone are side-by-side mat racers. Supercell is a champagne bowl slide. They're not as extensive as [Icon's](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) Thrill Island, but they're more than enough for most families. Splashaway Bay (the kids' aqua park) keeps young kids entertained for hours\u2014parents can grab coffee and actually relax.\n\n**Central Park remains one of cruising's best spaces.** Real trees. Open-air walkways. Quiet seating areas. 150 Central Park restaurant for upscale dining. Park Cafe for quick sandwiches. It's a serene escape in the middle of a mega-ship. Morning coffee in Central Park while the ship is at sea is genuinely peaceful.\n\n**Entertainment production value is top-tier.** Aqua Theater shows with high-diving acrobats (stunning at night). Grease the musical in the main theater (full Broadway production). Live music in Central Park. Comedy shows. Ice skating performances (yes, there's a full ice rink). Harmony doesn't just offer entertainment\u2014it offers *spectacle*.\n\n**Dining variety that works.** [Main dining room](/ships/rcl/harmony-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), [Windjammer buffet](/ships/rcl/harmony-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html) (steak), 150 Central Park (upscale), Jamie's Italian, Sabor (Mexican), Wonderland (molecular gastronomy), Johnny Rockets (burgers), Sorrento's (pizza), Park Cafe (sandwiches). Some cost extra, many are included. You won't run out of options on a seven-night cruise.\n\n**The Boardwalk at night is charming.** The carousel lights up. The outdoor bars fill with music. You're sitting outside, ten decks above the ocean, with a drink and live entertainment. It's surreal, festive, and surprisingly delightful.\n\n**Flow between neighborhoods feels natural.** Harmony's layout is clear. Signage is helpful. Elevators are well-distributed. Yes, it's massive, but you waste less time lost than you'd expect. By day two, you'll know where everything is.",

      "markdown": "**This is a 2016 ship.** Harmony has been refurbished, but it's not the newest Oasis-class option. [Wonder of the Seas](/ships/rcl/wonder-of-the-seas.html) (2022) has Suite Neighborhood upgrades and refinements Harmony doesn't. Harmony is polished and well-maintained, but you're not getting cutting-edge newness.\n\n**It's massive, and that brings challenges.** Elevators at peak times are packed. The [Windjammer buffet](/ships/rcl/harmony-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) at lunch feels like a crowded mall food court. Disembarkation takes forever\u2014you're not getting off this ship quickly. If you hate crowds or waiting, Harmony will test your patience.\n\n**It's designed for families.** Kids are everywhere. The pool deck is loud. Splashaway Bay, waterslides, ice skating\u2014all geared toward families with children. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic cruise, Harmony isn't it. [Solo travelers](/solo/why-i-started-solo-cruising.html) and couples seeking intimacy might feel like extras in a family vacation movie.\n\n**You need to plan ahead.** Specialty dining, show seating, shore excursions\u2014everything books fast. If you board without reservations and wing it, you'll get leftover time slots and sold-out options. Book your must-dos (dining, shows, Ultimate Abyss time slots) before you sail or within the first hour of embarkation.\n\n**Port days are optimized for mega-ships.** Harmony typically sails Western Mediterranean (Barcelona, Marseille, Rome) or Eastern Caribbean (Labadee, Falmouth, Cozumel). You're getting reliable ports that can handle massive ships, not hidden gem destinations. If you're cruising for unique, small-port charm, Harmony isn't optimized for that.\n\n**Specialty dining and extras add up.** [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html), 150 Central Park, Wonderland, Jamie's Italian\u2014most cost extra. Drink packages are pricey. Shore excursions run higher than independent options. If you're budget-conscious, you'll feel nickel-and-dimed. Stick to included dining and free activities to control costs.",
