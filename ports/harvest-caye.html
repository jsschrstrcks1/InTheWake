        <h1>Harvest Caye Port Guide</h1>
        <p class="port-subtitle">Norwegian Cruise Line's Private Belize Island</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Harvest Caye is Norwegian Cruise Line's 75-acre private island off the southern coast of Belize, about 30 miles from the mainland. Opened in 2016, this purpose-built cruise destination blends Caribbean beach relaxation with Belizean nature experiences. The island features a man-made lagoon with white-sand beach, a massive pool complex, wildlife sanctuary with rescued animals, zipline canopy tours, and complimentary dining — all designed to give Norwegian passengers a taste of Belize without leaving cruise line control.</p>

          <p>I visited Harvest Caye once, and what impressed me was how Norwegian balanced resort amenities with authentic Belizean elements. Unlike some private islands that feel artificial, Harvest Caye incorporates local wildlife, native plants, and cultural touches. The wildlife sanctuary rescued iguanas and scarlet macaws right there on the island, the nature center educates about Belize's ecosystems, and shore excursions connect to mainland attractions like Mayan ruins and the Belize Barrier Reef.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Island Features</h2>

          <h3>Lagoon Beach (Free)</h3>
          <p>The centerpiece is a 15-acre saltwater lagoon with white sand beach imported specifically for the island. Crystal-clear water, gentle waves, thousands of beach chairs and umbrellas. The lagoon is calm and shallow, perfect for families and swimmers. Beach volleyball, non-motorized water sports available. The beach wraps around the lagoon with multiple entry points and plenty of space even on sold-out ships.</p>

          <h3>Pool Complex (Free)</h3>
          <p>One of the largest resort pools in the Western Caribbean — 15,000 square feet of freshwater swimming. Swim-up bars serve drinks (beverage packages work here), in-pool loungers, shallow areas for kids. Surrounded by palm trees and tropical landscaping. Can get crowded mid-day but there's usually space somewhere.</p>

          <h3>Wildlife Sanctuary & Nature Center (Free)</h3>
          <p>Home to rescued and rehabilitated Belizean animals: scarlet macaws, toucans, green iguanas, boa constrictors, and other native species. The sanctuary partners with Belize conservation organizations. Nature trails wind through tropical vegetation with interpretive signs explaining the island's ecosystems. The nature center provides educational programs about Belize's biodiversity. Complimentary access, well worth 30-60 minutes.</p>

          <h3>Zipline Canopy Tour ($)</h3>
          <p>Seven ziplines across the island's canopy, including one that crosses the lagoon. The tour takes 1.5-2 hours with safety briefing and equipment. Typical cost $79-99 per person. Book in advance through Norwegian — this sells out quickly. Age and weight restrictions apply. Not for those afraid of heights, but thrilling views and well-operated.</p>

          <h3>Beach Cabanas & Villas ($)</h3>
          <p>Private beach cabanas with shade, seating, and dedicated service. Prices range $299-599+ depending on size and amenities. Some include food and beverage service, floating mats, snorkel gear. The lagoon villas are overwater bungalows with direct lagoon access. Book months in advance for popular sailings.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Dining & Beverages</h2>
          <p><strong>Complimentary Dining:</strong> Landshark Bar & Grill serves burgers, barbecue, seafood, salads, and tropical fare all day. No charge. Quality is standard cruise buffet level but fresh and well-prepared. Multiple serving stations reduce lines.</p>

          <p><strong>Bars:</strong> Multiple bars across the island — pool bar, beach bar, lagoon bar. Norwegian beverage packages work at all locations. Signature drinks include Belikin beer (local Belize brew), rum punches, and tropical cocktails.</p>

          <p><strong>Special Dining:</strong> Some sailings offer premium dining experiences (seafood feasts, beachfront dinners) for additional cost. Check with your ship's shore excursion desk.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Shore Excursions to Mainland Belize</h2>
          <p>Harvest Caye serves as a gateway to mainland Belize adventures. Norwegian offers excursions to nearby attractions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Belize Barrier Reef Snorkeling:</strong> The second-largest barrier reef in the world. Boat trips to pristine snorkel sites with tropical fish, sea turtles, rays.</li>
            <li><strong>Mayan Ruins:</strong> Nim Li Punit or Lubaantun archaeological sites with ancient pyramids and plazas.</li>
            <li><strong>Cave Tubing:</strong> Float through ancient cave systems on inner tubes — unique Belize experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Placencia Village:</strong> Charming beach town with local culture, shops, and restaurants.</li>
            <li><strong>Monkey River Tour:</strong> Wildlife-watching boat tour with howler monkeys, crocodiles, exotic birds.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All mainland excursions require booking through Norwegian. Travel time to mainland is typically 30-45 minutes by boat.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book Excursions Early:</strong> Zipline tours and mainland excursions sell out quickly. Book through the Norwegian app or website as soon as your cruise opens for booking.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrive Early for Beach Chairs:</strong> Best lagoon-front spots fill up by 9am-10am. If you want prime beachfront, disembark early.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunscreen & Sun Protection:</strong> You're in the tropics. Reef-safe sunscreen is encouraged (protecting the Belize Barrier Reef). Hats and sunglasses essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Not Needed:</strong> Everything charges to your Norwegian account. No need for Belize dollars or U.S. cash on the island itself (though cash helps if taking mainland excursions).</li>
            <li><strong>Tender or Pier:</strong> Ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to the island. Tendering is efficient and typically takes 5-10 minutes. Follow your ship's tender ticket system.</li>
            <li><strong>Return Times:</strong> Last tender typically departs island 90 minutes before ship sailing. Don't miss it — Norwegian won't wait.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
          I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. I visited Harvest Caye once on a Norwegian cruise, experiencing both the island's resort amenities and its connection to Belizean nature. The details reflect what I found on the ground, though private island offerings change — always verify current activities, pricing, and excursion availability with Norwegian before your cruise.
