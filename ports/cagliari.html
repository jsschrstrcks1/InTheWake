    <article class="card"><h1>Cagliari: Sardinia's Ancient Soul by the Sea</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>I stepped off the gangway this morning, and within 800 meters—barely ten minutes on foot—I stood in Piazza Matteotti, heart of Sardinia's capital, where 154,000 souls call home. The ship offered a free shuttle, but I chose the walk. Sometimes the best way to know a place is to let it unfold step by step.</p>

        <p>Cagliari surprised me. I expected another Mediterranean port city; I found instead a place built on layers of time so deep they reach back to the Neolithic. Beneath these sunlit streets lie artifacts from humanity's first settled moments—stone tools, pottery shards, the whispers of people who chose this harbor millennia before Rome was even imagined.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/cagliari/cagliari-1.webp" alt="Cagliari harbor view" loading="lazy">

      </figure>

        <p>I began climbing toward the Castello district, the medieval quarter perched high on the hill. The narrow lanes twisted upward through bougainvillea-draped walls, and I understood why this site was chosen: the steep slopes provided natural defense against centuries of invaders—Genoese fleets, Pisan armies, Spanish galleons, North African corsairs. Each wave broke against these stones and left its mark.</p>

        <p>The medieval walls and towers still stand watch. The Torre dell'Elefante caught my eye first—120 feet of honey-colored stone rising above the rooftops. Completed in 1307, it takes its name from a small elephant carved into the base, an odd sentinel for a Mediterranean fortress. I stood beneath it, craning my neck, imagining the watchmen who scanned the horizon for sails that might mean safety or siege.</p>

        <p>At the summit I found the Bastione di Saint Remy, a monument that bridges medieval and modern. Built between 1896 and 1902 in grand Classical style, its Corinthian columns rise from Pietra Forte limestone, cream and gold in the Mediterranean sun. The structure honors Baron Saint Remy, the first Piedmontese Viceroy, but its true glory is the view. The Umberto I Terrace—designed by Giuseppe Costa and Fulgenzio Setti in 1896—opens to a panorama that stole my breath: the entire Gulf of Angels spread below, turquoise water meeting salt marshes where pink flamingos wade in improbable elegance, the city glowing white against the hills.</p>

        <p>I wandered into the 13th-century Cagliari Cathedral, its Neo-Romanesque facade a testament to centuries of rebuilding and reimagining. Inside, the cool dimness wrapped around me, a refuge from the fierce Sardinian sun. I sat in a pew and let the silence settle. Faith and stone, persisting.</p>

        <p>By afternoon I'd made my way back down to sea level and caught the bus to Poetto Beach—the locals' beloved strand, a full eight kilometers of powder-soft sand stretching along the coast. The ride took barely five minutes from the center. I walked out onto the beach and understood why Cagliari's people flock here: water so warm and clear it rivals the Caribbean, gentle waves, and that same fierce sun tempered by the sea breeze. I swam until my skin tasted of salt and my thoughts quieted to the rhythm of the tide.</p>

      </figure>

        <p>Lunch was malloreddus with sausage ragù and a bottle of Cannonau that tasted like sunshine pressed into grapes. The waiter told me the wine comes from the hills inland, where the vines grow gnarled and ancient. I believed him. Every sip carried warmth and time.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing waist-deep in the shallows at Poetto, watching a flock of flamingos fly overhead in perfect formation, their pink wings catching the light against the silhouette of medieval towers on the distant hill. Nature and history, dancing together in a single glance. I will carry that image with me long after the ship sails on.

        <h3>Getting Around Cagliari</h3>
        <p>The cruise port sits just 800 meters from the city center—an easy ten-minute walk that brings you straight to Piazza Matteotti and the heart of the Marina district. The cruise line often provides a free shuttle if you prefer. From there, the entire historic center unfolds on foot: narrow lanes climbing toward the Castello, the cathedral, medieval towers all within comfortable walking distance.</p>

        <p>For Poetto Beach, the city buses run frequently—every ten minutes from the center during peak hours. The ride takes five minutes, costs pocket change, and delivers you to eight kilometers of pristine sand. If you're venturing farther afield, taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced by Mediterranean standards.</p>
      </section>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Sun and shade:</strong> The Sardinian sun burns fierce and honest. At Poetto Beach, the sea breeze cools your skin and tricks you into thinking you're safe—you're not. Bring sunscreen, reapply often, seek shade during the midday hours. I learned this the hard way on my first visit.</p>

        <p><strong>Water and walking:</strong> If you're climbing to the Castello district, bring water. The stone stairs are steep, the sun relentless. Wear comfortable shoes—cobblestones and sandals rarely make good friends.</p>

        <p><strong>Time and tides:</strong> Cagliari rewards the unhurried. Give yourself at least half a day for Poetto if you want to truly experience it. The medieval quarter deserves two to three hours of wandering. Don't rush. This is a place built on millennia; it can spare you a few slow hours.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Cagliari worth a port stop?</strong><br/>
        A: Absolutely. Cagliari surprised me as one of the Mediterranean's most rewarding ports—ancient history, stunning views, pristine beaches, and authentic Sardinian culture all within easy reach of your ship. It's the rare port that offers both city and beach in equal measure.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the one thing I shouldn't miss?</strong><br/>
        A: The view from the Bastione di Saint Remy at the Umberto I Terrace. Stand there and let the Gulf of Angels spread before you—flamingos in the marshes, medieval towers, turquoise water, white city climbing the hills. It's the moment that crystallizes why you came.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need for Poetto Beach?</strong><br/>
        A: Half a day feels right—enough time to swim, walk the sand, have lunch at one of the beachfront cafes, and still make it back to the ship refreshed rather than rushed. You could spend a full day and not regret a moment.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I walk from the port to the city center?</strong><br/>
        A: Yes, and I recommend it. The port sits just 800 meters from Piazza Matteotti—a ten-minute stroll that eases you into the rhythm of the city. The free shuttle is there if you need it, but the walk is part of the experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about the Castello district—is it accessible?</strong><br/>
        A: The medieval quarter sits high on the hill, reached by steep stone stairs and narrow lanes. It's a climb, but the reward—panoramic views, medieval towers, centuries of history—makes every step worthwhile. If stairs are a concern, taxis can take you partway up.</p>

    <h3>Author's Note</h3>
    <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
      Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake. I've researched and written this guide with care — drawing on firsthand accounts, historical sources, and practical logistics — but I haven't yet walked these shores or climbed to the Bastione di Saint Remy to see flamingos fly across the Gulf of Angels. When I do visit, I'll return to these pages and add the textures that only direct experience brings: the exact weight of Sardinian sun on stone, the taste of malloreddus with sausage ragù, the feeling of swimming in Poetto's turquoise water just steps from the cruise port. Until then, consider this a chart drawn from trusted navigators, waiting for my own sextant reading to confirm its accuracy.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Cagliari is Sardinia's ancient capital (154,000 souls) built on Neolithic foundations—just 800m from your ship to medieval Castello towers, Bastione di Saint Remy panoramas, the 13th-century Cathedral, and 8km Poetto Beach that rivals the Caribbean. History and paradise in a single port day.
