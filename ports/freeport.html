        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The taxi driver said "island time" with a grin that suggested both apology and philosophy. We'd asked how long to Gold Rock Beach—thirty minutes, he said, but then added that qualifier with a wink. Grand Bahama moved at its own pace, and after three days of cruise ship schedules and dinner seatings and shore excursion timing, surrendering to island time felt less like inconvenience and more like relief. The road stretched east through pine forests that seemed unlikely for the Bahamas until I remembered that Grand Bahama is larger than you'd expect, a flat sprawl of land where Caribbean pine outnumbers palm trees by orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p>The smell hit us first—salt and pine and something floral I couldn't name, carried on a breeze that seemed to know exactly what we needed. My wife rolled down her window despite the taxi's laboring air conditioning, and I understood why immediately. This wasn't air you wanted filtered. It was air you wanted to breathe deeply, to let fill your lungs and remind you that some places haven't been ruined yet. The driver noticed and smiled again. "That's the island," he said. "She welcomes you."</p>

            <p>Gold Rock Beach at Lucayan National Park earned every superlative I'd read. The sand was the color of powdered sugar, fine enough to squeak under bare feet. The water graduated from pale turquoise at the shore to deeper blues where the reef began, so clear I could see my toes when standing waist-deep. We'd brought our own snorkel gear from the ship—a lesson learned from previous ports—and the underwater world delivered immediately. Parrotfish grazed on coral. A spotted eagle ray glided past with the unhurried grace of something that knows no predators. Schools of yellow-tail snappers parted around us like living curtains. I floated face-down, breathing through the snorkel, watching shadows move across the sandy bottom, and felt time dissolve into salt water and sunlight.</p>

            <p>The park ranger at the entrance had mentioned caves—Lucayan National Park protects one of the world's longest underwater cave systems—but we'd chosen the low-energy option of simply sinking into the shallow water and watching the sky. I felt thankful for the simplicity of it. My wife found a sand dollar, perfect and intact, and pressed it into my palm like a gift. We'd been married fifteen years. We didn't need to speak. The sand dollar said everything—here is something beautiful, I want you to have it, I'm glad we're here together. I felt my heart catch at the simplicity of it. Sometimes the grandest gestures are the smallest ones, offered without words.</p>

            <p>We stopped at Port Lucaya Marketplace on the return, more for cold drinks than shopping. The straw market vendors called out greetings but didn't push hard—another benefit of island time, perhaps, or simply the knowledge that pushy selling rarely works on tired cruise passengers. We bought conch fritters from a stand near the marina, impossibly fresh, the batter crispy and the conch tender, with a hot sauce that made my eyes water and my taste buds sing. A Junkanoo musician was setting up his drums, the sound echoing across the water where sailboats rocked at anchor. The smell of the sea mixed with frying oil and coconut sunscreen. My wife laughed at something—I don't even remember what—and the sound seemed to float up into the cloudless sky.</p>

            <p>We found Deadman's Reef almost by accident. A local pointed us toward the rocky outcrop beyond the marina, saying the snorkeling was good if we didn't mind a swim. The reef sat maybe fifty yards offshore, and getting there meant picking through ankle-deep water over sea grass before the bottom dropped away. However, the effort paid off spectacularly. The reef teemed with fish—sergeant majors, blue tangs, yellowtail, and a hawksbill turtle that seemed unbothered by our presence. I hovered over brain coral formations that must have been centuries old, watching a moray eel peek from its hiding spot, feeling privileged to witness a world that operates perfectly well without human intervention.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> My wife pressing that sand dollar into my palm on Gold Rock Beach. No words, just the warmth of her hand and the perfect circle of that fragile shell. After fifteen years, some couples run out of things to say. We'd discovered that silence can be its own conversation, that presence matters more than performance, that finding a sand dollar and giving it away is a kind of love letter. My heart swelled with gratitude for this woman, for this moment, for the privilege of wandering the world together. I carry that sand dollar in my desk drawer now. It reminds me that the best gifts from travel aren't purchased—they're discovered, shared, and remembered. Tears pricked my eyes as I accepted it. Still do, sometimes, when I open that drawer and feel that blessed, weightless shell.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Freeport Harbour cruise terminal, a functional facility on the island's southern shore. The terminal has basic amenities—restrooms, small shops, taxi stand—but nothing elaborate. Most attractions require transportation. Port Lucaya Marketplace is approximately 10 minutes by taxi; Gold Rock Beach at Lucayan National Park is 30 minutes east. Taxis queue at the terminal, and fares are regulated by the government for common destinations.</p>

            <p>Currency is the Bahamian Dollar (BSD), pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. US dollars are accepted everywhere, and change is often given in a mix of both currencies. Credit cards are widely accepted at tourist establishments. ATMs are available at Port Lucaya Marketplace. Prices are generally lower than Nassau but higher than you might expect—this is still the Bahamas. Conch fritters at the marketplace run approximately $8-12 per order; beach chair rentals $20-30 for the day.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Gold Rock Beach involves a short walk from the parking area through pine forest—mostly flat and easy. Deadman's Reef snorkeling requires swimming to the reef (50+ yards). Port Lucaya Marketplace is flat and walkable. The heat and humidity can be intense; bring water and sunscreen. Wheelchair access is limited at natural sites but reasonable at Port Lucaya. Most tour vehicles have steps.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> The primary option for cruise visitors. Government-regulated fares apply to common destinations: approximately $10-15 to Port Lucaya (up to 4 passengers), $40-50 to Gold Rock Beach round trip with waiting time. Negotiate waiting time for remote locations. Taxis queue at the terminal; drivers are generally friendly and knowledgeable about the island.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Offer <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and handle all logistics. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($50-120) include transport, entrance fees, and often equipment for activities. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular snorkeling and swimming with pigs experiences. For Port Lucaya shopping, <strong>independent</strong> taxi is more flexible and cheaper.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Limited utility from the cruise terminal, which sits in an industrial area away from attractions. Port Lucaya Marketplace is walkable once you arrive, with shops, restaurants, and beach access clustered together. Gold Rock Beach requires a short walk through the national park from the parking area. The heat makes extended walking tiring—pace yourself.</p>

            <p><strong>Rental cars:</strong> Available but generally unnecessary for a single port day. Driving is on the left (British style), and roads are generally good. If you want to explore the island extensively, rental runs approximately $70-100 per day. Gas stations are available along main roads.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Port Lucaya Marketplace has paved surfaces and is reasonably accessible. The cruise terminal has ramps. Natural sites like Gold Rock Beach have sand approaches and uneven paths that challenge wheelchairs. Most tour vehicles have steps. Communicate specific needs when booking excursions—some operators can accommodate with advance notice.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Freeport offers excellent snorkeling, beautiful beaches, and relaxed Bahamian atmosphere. Most cruise calls (6-8 hours) allow time for one major excursion plus Port Lucaya exploration. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> work well for organized activities; <strong>independent</strong> taxi trips work for beach days. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular activities like swimming with pigs or shark encounters.</p>

            <h3>Gold Rock Beach (Lucayan National Park)</h3>
            <p>One of the Bahamas' most beautiful beaches with pristine white sand, crystal water, and no development. Located in Lucayan National Park, approximately 30 minutes east of the port. Entrance fee approximately $5 per person. The park also protects extensive underwater cave systems (guided tours available separately). <strong>Independent</strong> taxi with waiting time approximately $40-50. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($60-80) include transport and park entrance. Low stamina—short walk to beach, relaxation focus. Allow 3-4 hours. Bring snorkel gear, water, and snacks (no vendors).</p>

            <h3>Deadman's Reef Snorkeling</h3>
            <p>Excellent shore-accessible reef near Port Lucaya Marketplace with tropical fish, rays, and occasional sea turtles. Swim approximately 50 yards from shore to reach the reef. Rental gear available at Port Lucaya shops approximately $15-20. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy—taxi to Port Lucaya, walk to the reef access point. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> often combine Deadman's Reef with other activities. Moderate stamina—requires swimming ability. Allow 2-3 hours combined with marketplace exploration. Free access; bring or rent gear.</p>

            <h3>Port Lucaya Marketplace</h3>
            <p>Shopping, dining, and waterfront atmosphere 10 minutes from the cruise terminal. Duty-free shops offer jewelry, liquor, perfume, and Bahamian crafts. The straw market sells local handicrafts. Restaurants range from conch fritters stands to waterfront dining. Marina access and beach area included. <strong>Independent</strong> taxi approximately $10-15. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> often include Port Lucaya as part of island tours. Low stamina—flat walkable area. Allow 2-4 hours depending on shopping and dining plans.</p>

            <h3>Garden of the Groves</h3>
            <p>Botanical garden with tropical plants, waterfalls, wildlife, and a small chapel. Peaceful escape from the typical cruise port experience. Approximately 15 minutes from the port. Entrance approximately $18 for adults. <strong>Independent</strong> taxi visit straightforward. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> often combine with other attractions. Low stamina—paved walking paths with benches. Allow 1-2 hours. Guided tours available. Good option for nature lovers seeking quiet rather than beach crowds.</p>

            <h3>Swimming with Pigs Excursion</h3>
            <p>Visit nearby cays to swim with the famous Bahamas swimming pigs. These excursions include boat trip, pig encounter, snorkeling, and usually lunch. Located on various cays around Grand Bahama. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($150-200) handle all logistics—strongly recommended as <strong>independent</strong> booking is complicated. <strong>Book ahead</strong> as capacities are limited. Moderate stamina—boat trip plus swimming. Allow half-day (4-5 hours). Popular activity that books quickly.</p>

            <h3>Shark Encounter</h3>
            <p>Controlled dive or snorkel experience with Caribbean reef sharks at UNEXSO (Underwater Explorers Society). Various programs from shark observation to cage-less swimming with sharks. Located at Port Lucaya. Prices range $80-180 depending on experience level. <strong>Book ahead</strong> directly with UNEXSO or through ship excursions. Moderate to high stamina—diving or snorkeling in open water. Not for everyone, but unforgettable for those who participate.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Hurricane recovery:</strong> Grand Bahama was devastated by Hurricane Dorian in September 2019, and the island is still recovering. Many businesses closed permanently; others rebuilt slowly. Tourism dollars directly support recovery efforts. Visiting Freeport helps local families rebuild their lives. The Bahamian resilience is remarkable—the island has reopened for business with characteristic warmth despite the challenges.</p>

            <p><strong>Lucayan caves:</strong> Beneath Grand Bahama lies one of the world's longest underwater cave systems—over 6 miles of mapped passages. Lucayan National Park protects access to Ben's Cave and Burial Mound Cave, where Lucayan Indian remains were discovered. The caves were sacred to the original inhabitants. Today, certified cave divers can explore the system, while casual visitors can peer into the crystal-clear entrances and appreciate the geological wonder beneath their feet.</p>

            <p><strong>Conch culture:</strong> Conch (pronounced "konk") is the Bahamas' signature seafood—the large marine snail appears in fritters, salads, chowder, and simply "cracked" (tenderized and fried). At Port Lucaya, watch fishermen clean conch at the marina, a skill passed through generations. The shells pile up in massive mounds, eventually crushed for construction material or sold as souvenirs. Conch fritters are the quintessential cruise port snack—crispy, savory, and best eaten hot with plenty of hot sauce.</p>

            <p><strong>Junkanoo:</strong> The Bahamas' exuberant street parade tradition occurs on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, with elaborate costumes, cowbell rhythms, and goatskin drums creating an explosion of color and sound. While cruise visitors rarely catch the main parades, Junkanoo musicians often perform at Port Lucaya, offering a taste of the tradition. The polyrhythmic drumming originated with African enslaved people and evolved into a uniquely Bahamian celebration of freedom and identity.</p>
