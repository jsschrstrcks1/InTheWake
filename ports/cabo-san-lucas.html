      <h1>Cabo San Lucas: Where Desert Cliffs Plunge into Two Seas</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>Cabo hits different than other Mexican ports. There's no pier – our ship anchored in the bay while the famous Land's End arch rose from the water like a granite cathedral. Tender boats ferried us past sea lions lounging on rocks, pelicans dive-bombing for fish, and those dramatic formations that mark where the Sea of Cortez collides with the Pacific Ocean. The geography here is theatrical.</p>

        <p>The town itself is two personalities. The marina area caters to cruise passengers and spring breakers with neon bars and timeshare pitches. But walk a few blocks inland and you find taquerias where locals eat, markets selling fresh produce, and the quiet rhythms of a Baja California town that existed long before the resorts arrived.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Surprised Me:</strong> A water taxi dropped me at Lover's Beach – the only beach in the world where you can swim in two oceans. One side faces the calm Sea of Cortez, perfect for swimming. The other faces the Pacific with waves that'll kill you (seriously, don't). I sat on the sand between them, feet in both seas, watching whales breach in the distance. Not bad for a port day.
        </div>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Land's End and the Arch</h2>
        <p>El Arco – the famous arch – is Cabo's signature. Water taxis from the marina run constantly, circling the rock formations for photos and dropping passengers at Lover's Beach. The boat ride alone is worthwhile: sea lions bark from Neptune's Finger, pelicans pose on rocks, and the light through the arch changes by the hour.</p>
        <p>Lover's Beach (Playa del Amor) is the only accessible beach near Land's End. Bring snorkel gear – the Sea of Cortez side has decent snorkeling. Bring water and snacks too; the vendors there know they have a captive audience and price accordingly. The Pacific side – Divorce Beach – looks beautiful but has currents that drown tourists. Admire from a distance.</p>
        <p>For a unique perspective, kayak or paddleboard to the arch. Several operators rent equipment, and paddling into that natural cathedral at sunrise or sunset is unforgettable. Just watch for boat traffic.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Medano Beach</h2>
        <p>Medano is Cabo's main beach – a long crescent of sand lined with restaurants and beach clubs. Rent a lounger, order fish tacos and cold Pacifico, and watch the scene unfold. It's lively, sometimes rowdy, and thoroughly entertaining. The swimming is excellent – calm, warm water with a gentle slope.</p>
        <p>The beach clubs (Mango Deck, The Office, Baja Cantina) are known for their party atmosphere. If you want something mellower, walk further down the beach toward the Bahia Hotel. The sand is the same, the people-watching just as good, but the vibe is family-friendly.</p>
        <p>Water toys of every description are available for rent – jet skis, paddleboards, banana boats, parasailing. Haggle on prices, especially if you're paying cash. Competition is fierce and initial quotes are just opening offers.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Whale Watching</h2>
        <p>December through March, humpback and gray whales migrate through Cabo's waters, making this one of the world's best whale-watching destinations. Humpbacks breach dramatically, gray whales approach boats with their calves, and the experience is genuinely life-changing. Book a responsible operator that maintains proper distance.</p>
        <p>Even outside whale season, the Sea of Cortez teems with life. Jacques Cousteau called it "the world's aquarium." Snorkel tours to Santa Maria or Chileno Bay reveal tropical fish, rays, and the occasional sea turtle. Scuba divers can explore sea lion colonies and underwater sand falls.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Cabo a tender port?</summary><p>Yes – ships anchor in the bay and tender boats ferry passengers to the marina. Tender lines can be long; get tickets early if your ship uses a system. The tender ride itself offers great views of Land's End.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Cabo safe for cruise passengers?</summary><p>The tourist areas are safe. Exercise normal precautions – don't flash valuables, stick to populated areas, use official taxis or Uber. The security concerns you hear about Mexico don't typically affect Cabo's tourist zone.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's the best beach?</summary><p>Medano for the scene and swimming. Santa Maria or Chileno Bay for snorkeling and quieter vibes. Lover's Beach for the novelty of two oceans. Avoid the Pacific-facing beaches – dangerous currents.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>How do I get to San José del Cabo?</summary><p>San José, the quieter sister town, is about 30 minutes by taxi or shuttle. It has a charming art district and authentic Mexican atmosphere. Worth the trip if you want to escape the tourist bubble.</p></details>

        <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
        <p><strong>Cabo San Lucas</strong> is where desert meets sea at Land's End – the famous arch marking where the Pacific collides with the Sea of Cortez. Tender to the marina, water taxi to Lover's Beach, hang out at Medano, and watch for whales (December-March). It's dramatic, fun, and thoroughly Mexican Riviera.</p>
