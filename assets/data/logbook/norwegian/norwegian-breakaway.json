Frank was everywhere on that ship. At [Cirque Dreams](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-breakaway.html), where he would have gasped at the acrobats. At the [678 Ocean Place](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-breakaway.html) jazz club, where his foot would have tapped. At the Bermuda beaches he'd shown me in brochures for years.\n\nThe cruise wasn't escape from grief. It was completion\u2014finishing the someday we'd promised each other.\n\n**The truth:** Breakaway's Manhattan departure lets widows honor shared dreams. You sail from familiar water toward new horizons. The grief comes along. So does the love.\n\n---\n\n**Planning a cruise after loss?** Read: [In the Wake of Grief: When Loss Needs Water](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html).\n\nI cruise annually now. Always from Manhattan.
