          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The approach to Flåm is the opening act of something extraordinary. Our ship threaded through Aurlandsfjord—a slender branch reaching into the heart of Sognefjord, Norway's longest and deepest fjord—and the water lay so still it mirrored the mountains rising vertically on both sides. Waterfalls tumbled from heights that made me tilt my head back until my neck protested, white ribbons against dark granite dropping from heights that made passengers gasp and fumble for cameras. The air carried the cold scent of snowmelt and wet stone, the kind of mountain freshness you can taste on your tongue. And then, tucked into the innermost embrace of the fjord, cradled in a valley so impossibly green it hurt to look at, the tiny village of Flåm appeared.</p>

            <p>Four hundred souls call this place home. Today, our ship had brought two thousand visitors to their doorstep. The mathematics should spell disaster—the sort of overwhelming tourist crush that ruins places—yet somehow the village absorbs each arrival with remarkable grace. Perhaps it's because everyone scatters almost immediately: to the railway, to the viewpoints, to the fjord cruises. The village never quite feels overwhelmed, just animated.</p>

            <p>Everyone comes for the Flåmsbana—the Flåm Railway—and standing on the platform, understanding why didn't require much imagination. One of the world's steepest standard-gauge railway lines, this engineering marvel covers just twenty kilometers yet climbs from sea level to 867 meters at Myrdal station. That's a 5.5% gradient for most of the journey, which sounds modest until you're on the train watching the valley floor drop away beneath you at angles that seem to defy the laws of sensible railway construction. We'd booked tickets online months earlier, thankful for the foresight as we watched a queue of disappointed passengers turned away at the station.</p>

            <p>The railway took nearly twenty years to build—from 1924 to 1940—and riding it, I understood why. Twenty tunnels pierce the mountains, most of them hand-carved through solid rock by workers who must have possessed both extraordinary skill and extraordinary patience. One tunnel spirals completely around inside the mountain, gaining elevation in a 180-degree turn that you barely notice until the view out the window suddenly shows you where you were two minutes ago, hundreds of feet below. The wooden seats creaked beneath us as the train climbed, the smell of old timber and coal mingling with the crisp mountain air that rushed through open windows.</p>

            <p>The train slowed and stopped at Kjosfossen waterfall, and everyone piled out onto the viewing platform to photograph the cascade—a torrent of white water plunging down the mountainside with the kind of raw power that makes you instinctively step back. The sound was overwhelming, a roar that drowned conversation and filled my chest with vibration. Then music began echoing off the rocks, and a woman in flowing red appeared on the rocks beside the falls, dancing with movements fluid and otherworldly before she vanished into the mist. A huldra, they told us—the Norwegian folklore spirit of the wild places. For a moment, the line between myth and mountain blurred completely. I found myself holding my breath, tears welling unexpectedly at the sheer theatrical beauty woven into nature's grandeur.</p>

            <p>My wife squeezed my hand as we stood there, mist dampening our faces, the waterfall thundering beside us. Neither of us could find words. We didn't need them. My heart swelled until it ached, too full for speech. Some moments transcend language—they simply fill you until speaking would diminish what you're feeling. This was one of those moments. I thought about the workers who carved these tunnels by hand, who labored for twenty years so that strangers decades later could experience this view, and felt overwhelmed by the gift they'd left behind. Grateful doesn't begin to cover it.</p>

            <p>At Myrdal, we stepped onto a high plateau that felt like the roof of the world. Snow lingered in patches despite summer warmth below. The station sits at 867 meters, wrapped in alpine climate so different from the lush valley floor that the temperature drop made us reach for jackets. We ate packed sandwiches from the ship, warm coffee from a thermos my wife had wisely prepared, watching other trains arrive and depart on the main Bergen-Oslo line that passes through this remote junction. The scene felt timeless—mountains, trains, travelers pausing before continuing their journeys.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing on that platform at Kjosfossen with tears on my face, watching the huldra dancer disappear into the mist, feeling the waterfall's thunder in my bones. I'd come to Norway expecting beautiful scenery. I hadn't expected to be moved to tears by the marriage of engineering, folklore, and nature into something that felt almost sacred. The Norwegians understand that traveling is not just about destinations but about the journeys themselves—and they've built something that honors that truth with every curve of track and spray of waterfall. I felt blessed to be there, grateful for the privilege of witnessing what human hands and natural forces can create together.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock directly at Flåm pier, steps from the village center and Flåmsbana railway station. The entire village is walkable from the ship—no shuttles or transportation needed for the core attractions. On rare high-traffic days when multiple large ships arrive, some smaller vessels may anchor and tender, but this is uncommon. The pier area has basic facilities including restrooms and a small tourist information office.</p>

            <p>Currency is Norwegian Kroner (NOK). Credit cards are accepted almost universally—Norway is nearly cashless, and most transactions happen via card or mobile payment. ATMs are available in the village. Current exchange rate is approximately $1 USD = 10-11 NOK. Norway is expensive by any standard—budget $30-50 USD for a simple lunch, $6-8 for coffee, $12-15 for local craft beer at the brewpub. Eating breakfast on the ship and bringing snacks ashore is wise budget strategy.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to high depending on activities.</strong> The village itself is flat and easy to walk. The Flåmsbana railway requires minimal physical effort—you simply sit and enjoy. Stegastein viewpoint involves bus transport plus short walk. Hiking options range from gentle strolls to demanding mountain trails. The Nærøyfjord cruise is low-effort sightseeing. Wheelchair users will find the village center and railway station accessible, though many mountain excursions present challenges. The railway itself has accessible carriages—inquire when booking.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The village is tiny—everything within a few minutes' walk of the pier. The railway station, marina, shops, museum, and brewpub cluster within easy strolling distance. This is the primary way to experience Flåm itself. Sidewalks are excellent, terrain flat, and distances short.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Offer <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and handle logistics, particularly valuable for the Flåmsbana railway when independent tickets sell out. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($100-200) typically combine railway with other attractions. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through your cruise line for packages that bundle popular experiences. Cost premium is significant but stress reduction may be worthwhile.</p>

            <p><strong>Flåmsbana railway:</strong> The main attraction requires advance booking. Tickets at visitflam.com approximately $70-80 USD round trip. <strong>Book ahead</strong> as soon as your cruise is confirmed—morning departures sell out weeks in advance. The journey takes one hour each way. <strong>Independent</strong> booking saves money versus ship excursions if seats are available.</p>

            <p><strong>Buses:</strong> Regular service to Stegastein viewpoint and other local attractions. Departures timed reasonably well with cruise ship arrivals. Bus to Stegastein approximately $20-30 USD round trip, 30 minutes each way. Tickets available at tourist office or directly on bus. Schedules posted at the bus stop near the pier.</p>

            <p><strong>Fjord cruises:</strong> Boats to Nærøyfjord (UNESCO World Heritage) depart from Flåm Marina, steps from the pier. Two-hour round trips approximately $50-70 USD. Multiple daily departures during cruise season. <strong>Book ahead</strong> at visitflam.com for guaranteed seats, or purchase at the marina if availability allows. <strong>Independent</strong> booking straightforward.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The village center is flat and accessible. Railway station has accessible boarding and dedicated wheelchair spaces on trains. Buses to Stegastein may accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice—contact tourist office. Fjord cruise boats have limited accessibility; inquire when booking. Mountain hiking trails are generally not accessible. Overall, Flåm offers reasonable accessibility for a Norwegian fjord village, but mobility-impaired visitors should plan carefully and communicate needs in advance.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Flåm offers a focused set of world-class experiences: the legendary railway, dramatic viewpoints, and UNESCO fjord cruises. Most cruise calls (6-8 hours) allow time for the railway plus one additional activity. <strong>Book ahead</strong> is essential advice here—the railway especially sells out. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> guarantee capacity; <strong>independent</strong> booking saves money if you plan early.</p>

            <h3>Flåmsbana Railway</h3>
            <p>The essential Flåm experience. One of the world's steepest standard-gauge railways climbs 867 meters through twenty tunnels hand-carved through granite. The journey takes one hour each way with a stop at Kjosfossen waterfall where the huldra dancer performs. At Myrdal, you can explore the alpine plateau before returning. Round trip approximately $70-80 USD. <strong>Book ahead</strong> at visitflam.com months in advance—morning trains sell first. Low stamina—you simply sit and marvel. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($120-160) guarantee tickets and often combine with other attractions. Left side going up, right side coming down offers best waterfall views, though both sides are spectacular.</p>

            <h3>Stegastein Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>A wooden platform jutting thirty meters over the Aurlandsfjord, 650 meters above the water. The glass floor allows you to see straight down to the fjord below—simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying depending on your relationship with heights. Accessible by bus from Flåm village, approximately 30 minutes each way. Bus fare approximately $20-30 USD round trip. Free entry to the viewpoint itself. Allow 2-3 hours total. Low stamina—short walk from bus to platform. Can be combined with railway if you take an early train. Photographs from here are among Norway's most iconic.</p>

            <h3>Nærøyfjord Cruise</h3>
            <p>This UNESCO World Heritage fjord narrows so dramatically that mountains seem close enough to touch from the boat. Steep rock walls rise straight from the water, waterfalls scatter down their faces, and farms cling impossibly to tiny ledges of green. Two-hour round trip cruises depart from Flåm Marina. Approximately $50-70 USD per person. <strong>Book ahead</strong> at visitflam.com or purchase at the marina if seats remain. Low stamina—you simply watch from the deck. <strong>Independent</strong> booking straightforward. Combine with railway for a full day if time allows.</p>

            <h3>Flåm Railway Museum</h3>
            <p>Documents how workers carved the impossible railway through granite over twenty years. Photographs of men suspended on ropes against sheer cliff faces, drilling by hand. Artifacts and tools from the construction era. Free admission. Located near the railway station, walkable from the pier. Allow 30-60 minutes. Low stamina—indoor museum. Excellent complement to the railway journey itself. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy.</p>

            <h3>Kayaking on Aurlandsfjord</h3>
            <p>Paddle into the profound stillness of the fjord, experiencing the scenery from water level where the mountains rise even more dramatically around you. Guided tours available from the marina, approximately $80-120 USD for 2-3 hour experience. High stamina—requires paddling ability. Calm water makes this accessible for beginners in good physical condition. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through local operators. A more active alternative to the fjord cruise.</p>

            <h3>Cycling from Myrdal</h3>
            <p>Take the railway up to Myrdal, then cycle the entire route back down—twenty kilometers of downhill through tunnels and alongside waterfalls. Several operators in Flåm handle logistics including bike rental, shuttle, and safety briefing. Approximately $100-150 USD. High stamina—requires cycling confidence and comfort with sustained downhill. Exhilarating for the adventurous. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through local operators.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->
        <details class="port-section depth-soundings" open>
          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Twenty years of labor:</strong> The Flåmsbana railway represents one of the great engineering achievements of the twentieth century. Construction began in 1924 and wasn't completed until 1940—nearly two decades of work to build twenty kilometers of track. Workers carved eighteen of the twenty tunnels by hand, drilling and blasting through solid granite while suspended on ropes over sheer drops. The Nåli tunnel alone required 5,000 cubic meters of rock removal. One kilometer of track took one year to complete. This wasn't just construction; it was an act of collective will against impossible terrain.</p>

            <p><strong>Sognefjord:</strong> The Aurlandsfjord where Flåm sits is a branch of Sognefjord—Norway's longest (205 km) and deepest (1,308 m) fjord. These geological formations were carved by glaciers during ice ages, the immense weight of ice grinding valleys to depths below sea level. When the ice melted, seawater filled the trenches. The steep walls rising directly from water are what makes fjord scenery so dramatic—there are no foothills, no gradual slopes, just vertical mountains meeting mirror-still water.</p>

            <p><strong>The huldra dancer:</strong> Norwegian folklore speaks of the huldra—a beautiful woman who lives in the wild places, part human and part nature spirit. The dancer who appears at Kjosfossen waterfall during each railway stop evokes this myth, her red dress vivid against the white cascade, her movements otherworldly before she vanishes into mist. It's theatrical, yes, but also deeply connected to how Norwegians understand their landscape: as a place where the boundary between natural and supernatural feels thin.</p>

            <p><strong>Brown cheese and waffles:</strong> Before leaving Flåm, seek out Norwegian waffles with brunost—brown cheese. The caramel-sweet cheese against crispy heart-shaped waffles sounds dubious but tastes like comfort food from someone else's childhood. Add cloudberry jam if available—those golden Arctic berries carry tart complexity that elevates the experience. The Ægir Brewpub serves excellent local craft beers in a building shaped like a Viking longhouse. Expect to pay $15-20 USD for a simple waffle and coffee, but the experience is genuinely Norwegian rather than generic tourist fare.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Flåm worth visiting on a rainy day?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely. Waterfalls are more dramatic in rain, mist adds mystery to the fjord scenery, and the railway runs regardless of weather. Pack layers and waterproofs. Many visitors find moody weather enhances rather than diminishes the experience.</p>

              <summary>Can I do both the railway and Stegastein viewpoint?</summary>
              <p>Yes, but it's tight with typical cruise calls. Take an early train (if you've booked ahead), return mid-morning, then bus to Stegastein. Or do Stegastein first thing and catch an afternoon train. Planning is essential—don't attempt both without confirmed bookings.</p>
