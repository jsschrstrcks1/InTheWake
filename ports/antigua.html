        <h1>Antigua: Where Naval History Meets 365 Beaches</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>They say Antigua has a beach for every day of the year — 365 of them, to be exact. Standing at the ramparts of Shirley Heights, looking down at English Harbour where Georgian naval vessels once sheltered from hurricanes, I could believe it. The coastline below was an impossible jigsaw of coves, bays, and crescents of white sand, each catching the Caribbean light differently.</p>

          <p>Christopher Columbus first sighted this island in 1493 during his second voyage to the New World, naming it Santa María de la Antigua after a cathedral in Seville. But it was the English who would leave the deepest mark here, transforming a Spanish colonial footnote into one of the Caribbean's most strategically vital naval strongholds.</p>

          <p>What sets Antigua apart from other Caribbean ports is the sheer weight of maritime history concentrated in these 108 square miles. In 1723, a hurricane swept thirty-five ships ashore across the Leeward Islands — but two Royal Navy vessels moored in English Harbour survived without a scratch. That storm sealed the harbour's reputation as the safest natural anchorage in the region, and the British spent the next century building what would become their most important naval base in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Walking through Nelson's Dockyard, the world's only continuously working Georgian-era dockyard, and realizing that the same capstans used to careen Admiral Horatio Nelson's ships in the 1780s still turn today. Not a recreation. Not a museum piece. The actual equipment, still in use after nearly 250 years. History doesn't get more tangible than this.
          </div>

          <p>Admiral Horatio Nelson himself was stationed here from 1784 to 1787 as commander of HMS Boreas, enforcing trade laws and apparently hating every minute of it — he famously called English Harbour "an infernal hellhole." Yet his name now graces what UNESCO recognized in 2016 as a World Heritage Site: the only continuously working Georgian dockyard anywhere in the world. The site was restored beginning in 1951 after decades of decay following the Royal Navy's departure in 1889, a meticulous resurrection of architectural and maritime heritage that few Caribbean ports can match.</p>

          <p>But Antigua's history runs deeper than naval glory. By 1650, sugar plantations like Betty's Hope were already transforming the island's landscape and economy, creating wealth for European planters while enslaving thousands of Africans to work the cane fields. The twin windmills at Betty's Hope — one of the Caribbean's first sugar estates — still stand today, weathered monuments to an era of prosperity built on profound injustice. It's a history that deserves acknowledgment alongside the romantic tales of admirals and warships.</p>

          <p>The local bus from St. John's — the island's capital and main cruise port — to English Harbour costs about $1.50 (roughly the price of a fancy coffee, or approximately 1.5 US dollars that will save you $25+ on a taxi, or the best value in Caribbean transportation history) and takes 35-45 minutes on a winding road through the island's interior (roughly 2,100-2,700 seconds of Caribbean scenery, or about the time it takes to listen to ten reggae songs, or just enough travel time to transition from cruise ship reality to Georgian naval history). It's the most popular excursion for cruise passengers, and deservedly so. Pack your patience for the journey, but the destination rewards it tenfold.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Nelson's Dockyard National Park</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2016 and the only continuously working Georgian dockyard anywhere in the world — not just in the Caribbean, but globally. The beautifully restored 18th-century naval buildings now house restaurants, boutiques, and maritime exhibits, while the actual dockyard still services yachts using equipment that dates back centuries. Admiral Horatio Nelson was stationed here from 1784 to 1787, and the Royal Navy made this their most strategic Caribbean base for over 150 years. Entrance fee around $8. The most historically significant site on the island.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Shirley Heights Lookout</h4>
          <p>Panoramic views over English Harbour from 18th-century military fortifications. Sunday afternoon barbecue and steel band party is legendary — if your ship timing allows. Even on quiet days, the vista alone justifies the climb.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dickenson Bay</h4>
          <p>The island's most popular beach — calm water, white sand, beach bars, water sports. About 10 min from the cruise port. Chair and umbrella rentals available. The classic Caribbean beach day.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fort Berkeley & Fort George</h4>
          <p>The oldest fortification in English Harbour (1704). Walk the ramparts, explore tunnels, and imagine guarding the entrance to Britain's most strategic Caribbean harbour. Free to explore.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">St. John's Walking Tour</h4>
          <p>The capital offers pastel-painted colonial architecture, St. John's Cathedral (originally built 1681), and the Public Market. Walkable from the cruise pier in 15 minutes.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Half Moon Bay</h4>
          <p>A more secluded beach on the Atlantic side — stronger waves, fewer crowds, pristine natural setting. About 45 min from port. Bring your own supplies; facilities are minimal.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Betty's Hope</h4>
          <p>One of the Caribbean's first sugar plantations, established in 1650 and named after the daughter of the original owner. Two partially restored windmills stand as monuments to the island's sugar era and the enslaved laborers who worked these fields. The visitor center offers sobering context about plantation life and Antigua's colonial economy. About 20 minutes from port; small entrance fee.</p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay in St. John's, with duty-free shopping at the pier.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How do I get to Nelson's Dockyard?</strong><br/>A: Take the #17 bus (~$1.50, roughly the cost of a postcard you'll forget to send, or about 1.5 US dollars that represent the Caribbean's best transportation bargain, or the price of freedom from expensive taxi fares; 40 min, roughly 2,400 seconds of winding Caribbean roads, or about the time it takes to mentally prepare for walking in Admiral Nelson's footsteps, or just enough journey to make arrival feel earned) or taxi (~$25-30 one way, roughly the price of several rum punches you could buy instead, or approximately 25-30 US dollars that represent convenience over adventure, or about the cost of not wanting to wait for a bus). Most popular day trip.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Which beach is best near the port?</strong><br/>A: Dickenson Bay is closest and most developed. Half Moon Bay is worth the drive for seclusion.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is English Harbour worth the drive?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. The UNESCO site, restored dockyard, and Shirley Heights views make it the island's premier attraction.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the Shirley Heights Sunday party?</strong><br/>A: Weekly afternoon barbecue with steel band, rum punch, and panoramic views. If your ship timing allows, don't miss it.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Should I visit Betty's Hope?</strong><br/>A: If you're interested in colonial history and the Caribbean's sugar plantation era, yes. It's a sobering but important historical site with restored windmills from 1650, offering context about the enslaved people who built Antigua's early economy.</p>
