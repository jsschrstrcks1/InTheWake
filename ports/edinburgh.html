        <h1>Edinburgh: Ancient Stones, Living History, Highland Soul</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Edinburgh Castle commands everything. Perched atop Castle Rock — a plug of ancient volcanic basalt thrust up from the earth 350 million years ago — this fortress has dominated the landscape since the 2nd century AD, when Celtic tribes first recognized the defensive genius of this stone throne. The 11th-century fortress that rose here became royal residence, military stronghold, state prison, and the keeper of Scotland's soul. Today it guards the Honours of Scotland, the oldest crown jewels in Britain, locked away since 1707 when Scotland and England merged their parliaments. Inside St. Margaret's Chapel, built in the 1130s and the oldest surviving building in Edinburgh, light filters through stained glass onto stone worn smooth by nine centuries of prayers. Outside on the ramparts, Mons Meg — a medieval siege cannon forged in 1449 — still aims across the Firth of Forth, while the One O'Clock Gun has marked time since 1861, its daily crack echoing across the city like a heartbeat.</p>

          <p>Your ship will dock at one of several ports serving Edinburgh. Most arrive at Leith, the deep-water commercial harbor two miles north that has been Edinburgh's gateway to the world for centuries — historically the conduit for French wine and eventually the whisky trade that made Scotland famous across Europe. Leith accommodates larger vessels, while smaller ships sometimes berth here alongside working docks transformed into trendy waterfront restaurants. Newhaven, just west of Leith, handles tender operations for ships anchoring offshore. Some vessels dock at South Queensferry beneath the magnificent Forth Bridge, ten miles west, or occasionally at Rosyth naval base across the Firth of Forth. But regardless of where you arrive, Edinburgh proper is where time slows down and history breathes. The Royal Mile — precisely 1.13 miles, measured in the old Scots mile — stretches from the Castle's volcanic perch down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official Scottish residence of the British monarch. This cobblestone artery runs straight through Scotland's heart, past St. Giles' Cathedral where John Knox preached reformation, past the hidden closes where Real Mary King's Close tours descend into preserved 17th-century streets buried beneath the modern city, past the bold angular lines of the Scottish Parliament building that rose in 2004 to house a reconvened Scottish voice.</p>

          <p>Leith's past as a trading port infuses Edinburgh with whisky culture that runs deeper than tourism. While the Scotch Whisky Experience on the Royal Mile offers a solid introduction to Scotland's national spirit, whisky lovers should seek out Cadenhead's on the Royal Mile — Scotland's oldest independent bottler, established in 1842, where single-cask malts are bottled at cask strength without chill-filtration, the way whisky used to taste before marketing took over. The Johnnie Walker Experience celebrates Edinburgh's most famous whisky export (though purists will tell you blended whisky isn't "real" Scotch). But it's in Leith's old bonded warehouses, where casks once aged before export to France, Germany, and the Low Countries, that you feel the historical weight of Scotland's liquid gold — the trade that built fortunes, funded rebellions, and carried Scottish identity to every corner of the globe.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in St. Margaret's Chapel inside Edinburgh Castle — the oldest building in the city, built in the 1100s. Tiny, stone, plain. Light filtered through stained glass showing Scotland's patron saint. A woman was praying quietly in the corner. Outside, you could see for miles — the Firth of Forth, the hills of Fife, the city spreading below. Nine hundred years of prayers in that little room. I understood why Scots love this place so fiercely.
          </div>

          <p>Edinburgh hosts the world's largest arts festival every August — the Fringe — when the population doubles and the entire city becomes a stage. But even in quieter months, Edinburgh hums with culture. Street performers on the Royal Mile. Whisky bars tucked into medieval vaults. The National Museum (free!) with everything from Dolly the sheep to ancient Pictish stones. This is a city that has shaped Scottish identity, British literature, and Enlightenment philosophy. Walk slowly. Pay attention. The stones talk.</p>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Insider advice from experience.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book Edinburgh Castle tickets online:</strong> Saves time and money. Walk-up queues can be 30+ min in summer.</li>
            <li><strong>August is Fringe Festival chaos:</strong> Amazing cultural experience but crowds are intense, accommodation scarce, prices high. If you're visiting in August, embrace it or stay on the ship.</li>
            <li><strong>The Royal Mile has tourist traps:</strong> Tartan shops and whisky stores are everywhere. Buy if you want, but know you're paying tourist prices. For better whisky shops, try Cadenhead's or Royal Mile Whiskies.</li>
            <li><strong>Scottish weather is unpredictable:</strong> Pack layers and rain gear even in summer. Sun, rain, wind all in one day is normal.</li>
            <li><strong>Midges in summer:</strong> Tiny biting flies prevalent in Scotland May-September, especially in evening and near water. Bring repellent if you're hiking or visiting countryside.</li>
            <li><strong>Free museums are AMAZING:</strong> National Museum of Scotland, National Galleries — world-class and free. Don't skip them.</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Edinburgh tours:</strong> Real Mary King's Close and Edinburgh Vaults tours explore the city beneath the Royal Mile. Fascinating history but book ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect the One O'Clock Gun:</strong> Fired from the Castle daily at 1pm sharp. If you're nearby, it WILL startle you. Locals use it to set their watches.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Haggis:</strong> Scotland's national dish — sheep's offal with oats, onions, spices, traditionally in a sheep's stomach. Earthy, savory, better than it sounds. Try it.</li>
            <li><strong>Scotch Whisky:</strong> Single malts from across Scotland — Highlands, Speyside, Islay, each region distinct. Pubs and whisky bars offer tastings.</li>
            <li><strong>Scottish Salmon:</strong> Smoked or fresh, Scottish salmon is world-class</li>
            <li><strong>Cullen Skink:</strong> Creamy smoked haddock soup — warming, delicious, very Scottish</li>
            <li><strong>Shortbread:</strong> Buttery Scottish biscuits — simple, perfect with tea</li>
            <li><strong>Tablet:</strong> Like fudge but grainier, sweeter — Scottish sugar rush</li>
            <li><strong>Cranachan:</strong> Traditional dessert with oats, cream, whisky, raspberries, honey</li>
            <li><strong>Irn-Bru:</strong> Bright orange Scottish soft drink, national obsession, tastes vaguely like bubblegum</li>
