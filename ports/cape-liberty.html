          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>Driving through the industrial outskirts of Bayonne on a gray November morning, navigating past container yards and freight terminals, brought doubts about choosing Cape Liberty over Manhattan. The GPS led down Port Terminal Boulevard toward what looked like just another New Jersey shipping facility. However, rounding the final turn and seeing the ship towering above the waterfront changed everything. The Statue of Liberty stood across the harbor, her torch raised against the pewter sky, and suddenly this utilitarian port felt like sacred ground.</p>

            <p>The terminal sits on the former Military Ocean Terminal, where over fifty million American troops embarked for Europe during World War II and Korea. Walking across the parking lot, I thought about all those young men who had crossed this same ground on their way to uncertain futures—some never to return. The weight of that past pressed against me even as I wheeled my suitcase toward the modern cruise terminal. Cape Liberty carries more than passengers; it carries memory. That sense of stepping into something larger than myself stayed with me through the entire embarkation process.</p>

            <p>Check-in moved faster than expected. No Manhattan traffic nightmares, no fighting for cabs, no overwhelming crowds. The terminal staff processed passengers efficiently, and within an hour I stood on the ship's top deck watching the loading cranes swing luggage aboard—grateful for the ease of it all. The smell of diesel and salt water mingled with cold November air. Jersey City's modest skyline rose to the left while Manhattan's towers glittered in the distance to the right. Technically in New Jersey, but the Empire State Building and Freedom Tower filled the view—the whole magnificent sweep of America's greatest city framed perfectly from this unexpected vantage point.</p>

            <p>The sailaway began at four o'clock, and the wisdom of choosing Cape Liberty became immediately clear. The ship backed away from the pier and began its slow turn toward the harbor mouth. Passengers lined the rails three deep, cameras ready, voices falling to whispers. The Statue of Liberty grew larger as we approached—not the distant postcard image seen from Manhattan ferries, but close enough to see the green patina on her copper skin, close enough to feel like she was looking directly at each of us. My breath caught in my chest. Lady Liberty stood there in all her magnificence, and we were sailing past her toward the open Atlantic.</p>

            <p>We passed so close I could read the inscription on the pedestal. The late afternoon light caught her torch and set it blazing gold against the darkening sky. Around me, I heard sniffles and saw passengers wiping their eyes. An elderly man beside me removed his cap and held it over his heart. "My father came through Ellis Island in 1923," he said quietly. "He would have seen her from exactly this angle." My own eyes filled with unexpected tears—not just for his father's story but for all the stories, all the arrivals and departures, all the hopes carried across this water for centuries. Some moments transcend tourism and become pilgrimage.</p>

            <p>The ship curved past Governors Island and into the Narrows, Manhattan's skyline now a panorama of lights against the gathering dusk. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge arched overhead, its suspension cables disappearing into low clouds. I stood at the rail until the last glow of the city faded behind us, until only the running lights of other ships and the distant pulse of buoys marked our passage. The cold drove most passengers inside, but I lingered, watching America recede, feeling the particular melancholy that comes with every departure—the bittersweet recognition that leaving is the price we pay for the privilege of arriving somewhere new.</p>

            <p>What I learned from Cape Liberty surprised me. I had expected a second-rate alternative to Manhattan's cruise terminal, a compromise for budget-conscious travelers willing to sacrifice glamour for parking convenience. Instead, I discovered that Cape Liberty offers something Manhattan cannot—the most emotionally powerful sailaway in American cruising. You don't just leave New York; you sail past its soul, past the statue that welcomed generations of immigrants, past the waters where history itself seems to ripple in your wake. Nevertheless, the practical advantages remain: parking costs less, traffic flows easier, Newark Airport sits twenty minutes away instead of an hour. The smart choice happens also to be the beautiful one.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That elderly man removing his cap as we passed the Statue of Liberty, his voice breaking when he mentioned his father's arrival from the old country. My heart ached with the accumulated weight of all those immigrant dreams, all those departures and arrivals, all the courage it took to cross oceans toward uncertain futures. I returned to my cabin changed, reminded that every journey—even a pleasure cruise—participates in something ancient and human and sacred.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Cape Liberty taught me that grace often hides in unexpected places. The industrial setting, the New Jersey location, the lack of Manhattan's obvious glamour—none of it matters when you're sailing past Lady Liberty at sunset. The lesson is one I keep relearning: don't judge departure points by their addresses. Judge them by what they reveal as you leave.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cape Liberty Cruise Port occupies the site of the former Military Ocean Terminal at 4 Port Terminal Blvd, Bayonne, NJ 07002. Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises operate from this terminal, sailing to Bermuda (most popular), the Bahamas, Caribbean, and Canada/New England itineraries. The terminal opened in 2004 and has grown into New York's primary alternative to Manhattan's cruise facilities.</p>

            <p>The terminal building offers modern check-in facilities, restrooms, and basic amenities. Wheelchair accessibility throughout the terminal and gangway. Parking lots sit adjacent to the terminal—no shuttle required from your car to check-in. Port staff are efficient and embarkation typically moves faster than Manhattan terminals due to lower passenger volume. Plan to arrive 2-3 hours before sailing; earlier during peak summer weekends.</p>

          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Cape Liberty requires vehicle transportation to reach—there's no walking to attractions from the terminal itself. However, accessing Manhattan and surrounding areas is straightforward with multiple options available.</p>

            <p><strong>By car:</strong> Newark Airport (EWR) is 15-20 minutes via NJ Turnpike—significantly closer than JFK (45-60 minutes). Manhattan reaches via Holland Tunnel (20-30 minutes without traffic) or Lincoln Tunnel. All bridges and tunnels use cashless tolling—E-ZPass or license plate billing.</p>

            <p><strong>Rideshare:</strong> Uber and Lyft serve the area well. Expect $25-40 from Newark Airport, $50-70 from JFK, $30-50 from Manhattan depending on traffic and time of day. Drivers can access the terminal directly.</p>

            <p><strong>Public transit to Manhattan:</strong> PATH train offers the most affordable option. Drive or taxi to Exchange Place station in Jersey City, then ride 8 minutes to World Trade Center ($2.75 fare). Hudson-Bergen Light Rail connects Bayonne to Hoboken and Jersey City for PATH transfers. NY Waterway ferry provides scenic service from Jersey City to Midtown and Wall Street.</p>

            <p><strong>Parking:</strong> On-site parking in covered lots costs approximately $22-30 per day depending on season. Reserve through your cruise line during peak summer months. Lots sit steps from the terminal—no shuttle required. Third-party off-site lots offer minimal savings and less convenience.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Terminal is fully wheelchair accessible with flat surfaces throughout. Accessible parking available near terminal entrance. Moderate stamina needed for pre-cruise Manhattan sightseeing; low stamina required for terminal navigation itself.</p>

          <summary><h2>Pre-Cruise Activities</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Cape Liberty's location offers unique pre-cruise opportunities—the entire New York metropolitan area sits within reach. Most cruisers arrive a day early to explore, avoid travel stress, and ensure they don't miss their ship. Go independent for most activities; book ahead for Statue of Liberty crown access and popular shows.</p>

            <h3>Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island</h3>
            <p>America's most iconic monument stands just across the harbor. Ferries depart from Liberty State Park (10 minutes from port) or Battery Park in Manhattan. Pedestal access included with ferry ticket ($24); crown access requires advance reservation—book months ahead through the National Park Service ($24.30 total). Ellis Island Immigration Museum tells the story of 12 million immigrants who arrived between 1892-1954. Search the online passenger database before visiting to find family names. Allow 4-5 hours for both islands. Go independent—ship excursions not applicable for homeport. Low to moderate stamina level.</p>

            <h3>Liberty State Park</h3>
            <p>This 1,212-acre waterfront park offers stunning Manhattan views, the Empty Sky 9/11 Memorial, nature trails, and picnic areas. Free admission. Ferry launches to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island depart from here. The park provides perfect photo opportunities of the skyline and Lady Liberty. Go independent. Low stamina level on flat, paved paths. Wheelchair accessible throughout main areas.</p>

            <h3>Manhattan Exploration</h3>
            <p>The entire city awaits via PATH train, tunnel, or ferry. Times Square, Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State Building, 9/11 Memorial, Broadway theaters—choose based on interests and time. Many cruisers stay in Manhattan the night before and taxi to Cape Liberty morning of departure. Go independent for flexibility. Book ahead for Broadway shows, popular restaurants, and observation deck timed entries. Moderate to high stamina level depending on itinerary.</p>

            <h3>9/11 Memorial & Museum</h3>
            <p>Moving tribute at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan, accessible via PATH train to World Trade Center station. The memorial pools and museum honor the victims of September 11, 2001. Memorial is free; museum admission $33 adults. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Timed entry tickets recommended—book ahead online. Go independent. Low stamina level with extensive walking. Fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <h3>Jersey City & Hoboken</h3>
            <p>Skip Manhattan prices with excellent dining and evening entertainment in these waterfront communities. Hoboken's Washington Street offers restaurants, cafes, and shops in a walkable strip. Jersey City's waterfront provides Manhattan views at a fraction of the cost. Pre-cruise dinner options abound without the hassle of Manhattan reservations. Go independent—no booking needed for most venues. Low to moderate stamina level. Wheelchair accessible along waterfront paths. Good alternative for those avoiding Manhattan complexity.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Cape Liberty's history runs deeper than most cruisers realize. The Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne (MOTBY) served as America's primary troop embarkation point during World War II and the Korean War. Over fifty million service members and their supplies passed through this peninsula on their way to European and Pacific theaters. The scale of that operation—ships loading around the clock, troops streaming across gangways toward uncertain futures—makes our modern cruise embarkations seem almost trivial by comparison.</p>

            <p>The terminal closed in 1999 after decades of declining military use. When Royal Caribbean opened the cruise facility in 2004, they transformed a site heavy with wartime memory into something new. Nevertheless, traces of the military past remain visible—the former administration building still stands near the terminal, and the layout of the port area reflects its wartime logistics purpose.</p>

            <p>The Statue of Liberty sailaway that makes Cape Liberty famous connects to another layer of regional significance. For immigrants arriving through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, Lady Liberty represented first sight of American possibility. Sailing past her today reverses that journey—departure rather than arrival—but carries echoes of all those earlier crossings. The harbor holds more stories than any single voyage can contain.</p>

              <summary>Is Cape Liberty better than Manhattan cruise terminal?</summary>
              <p>For parking and traffic, yes. Cape Liberty offers easier access, significantly lower parking costs ($22-30/day vs $50+), and the iconic Statue of Liberty sailaway views. However, Manhattan terminal is more convenient if you're already staying in NYC without a car and want to minimize travel on embarkation day.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How early should I arrive at Cape Liberty?</summary>
              <p>Plan to arrive 2-3 hours before sailing time. Earlier during busy summer weekends when parking lots fill and check-in lines grow. The efficient terminal means you'll likely board within an hour, leaving time to explore the ship before sailaway.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I visit Manhattan from Cape Liberty?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely. PATH train from Jersey City reaches World Trade Center in 8 minutes ($2.75). Uber/taxi through Holland Tunnel takes 20-30 minutes without traffic. NY Waterway ferries offer scenic crossings. Many cruisers stay in Manhattan and taxi to the port morning of departure.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Which side of the ship for Statue of Liberty views?</summary>
              <p>Starboard (right side) facing forward provides the best views as the ship sails out. Position yourself on upper decks at least 30 minutes before departure. The ship passes quite close to Lady Liberty—bring binoculars and cameras with good zoom.</p>

              <summary>What airlines fly into Newark Airport?</summary>
              <p>Newark (EWR) serves as a United hub with extensive domestic and international service. All major US carriers operate here. The 15-20 minute drive to Cape Liberty makes Newark the obvious airport choice over JFK (45-60 minutes) or LaGuardia (40-50 minutes).</p>
