      <h1>Bimini: Where Hemingway Chased Giants</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The Bahamas begin here — a chain of 700 islands stretching southeast from this tiny archipelago just 50 miles off the Florida coast. Bimini is barely a speck on the map: North Bimini and South Bimini together barely exceed seven square miles. Yet these islands punch far above their weight in legend and lore. Ernest Hemingway spent his summers here in the 1930s, battling marlin in the Gulf Stream and writing parts of what would become "Islands in the Stream." The waters off Bimini run deep and blue, the continental shelf dropping away just offshore where the Gulf Stream rushes north carrying everything from tuna to sailfish within reach of small boats.</p>

        <p>And then there's the mystery. In 1968, divers discovered an underwater formation of massive rectangular limestone blocks arranged in a J-shape on the seafloor. Some call it the Bimini Road; others believe it's evidence of Atlantis. Scientists debate whether it's natural beach rock or something more. Whatever its origin, snorkeling above those ancient-looking stones in 15 feet of crystal-clear water stirs something primal — a sense that these islands hold secrets older than their 2,000-year human history.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment:</strong> Standing at the Compleat Angler bar (since burned down but rebuilt), looking at photos of Hemingway with his catches — fish larger than men, held aloft in black and white. The same Gulf Stream that carried those giants still runs past my window, unchanged and eternal.
        </div>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>The Cruise Port Experience</h2>
        <p>Most cruise ships calling on Bimini dock at Resorts World Bimini, a purpose-built destination on North Bimini's north end. The resort includes a massive pool complex, beach access, casino, restaurants, and water sports rentals. It's designed as a complete beach day experience — you can easily spend your entire port call here without venturing further.</p>
        <p>But venture further you should. Alice Town, the main settlement on North Bimini, lies a short taxi or golf cart ride south. This is where Hemingway drank and fished, where Ponce de León supposedly sought the Fountain of Youth, and where Bahamian life unfolds at its unhurried pace. The King's Highway runs the length of the island — all of one lane wide, lined with colorful clapboard buildings, rum bars, and fishing charter offices.</p>
        <p>South Bimini, connected by a short ferry ride, offers quieter beaches and nature trails through mangroves. The Bimini Biological Field Station here studies lemon sharks, and visitors can sometimes observe the research.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>The Bimini Road & Snorkeling</h2>
        <p>The mysterious Bimini Road lies about a half-mile offshore in 15-20 feet of water. Snorkel tours ($60-80) take you to swim above the rectangular stone blocks that have sparked decades of debate. Whether ancient road, natural formation, or something stranger, it's an unforgettable swim — the stones are massive and undeniably geometric, arranged in patterns that seem too regular for chance.</p>
        <p>Beyond the Road, Bimini's waters offer exceptional snorkeling and diving. The Sapona, a concrete ship wrecked in 1926, sits in shallow water south of the islands — its superstructure rises above the surface while fish swirl through its holds below. Rainbow Reef, Tuna Alley, and the mangrove nurseries of South Bimini provide encounters with everything from nurse sharks to spotted eagle rays.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Practical Realities</h2>
        <p>Bimini is small and casual. Golf carts are the primary transportation — rent one for $50-70 for the day to explore at your own pace. The currency is Bahamian dollars, pegged 1:1 to USD, and US dollars are accepted everywhere.</p>
        <p>Alice Town has a handful of restaurants serving fresh conch, cracked lobster, and Bahamian staples. The water here is potable, the people welcoming, the pace slow. This isn't a shopping destination or a cultural hotspot — it's a place to feel sand between your toes, swim in impossibly clear water, and maybe catch a glimpse of what drew Hemingway to keep returning, summer after summer, to chase giants in the Gulf Stream.</p>
