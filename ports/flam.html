      <h1>Flåm: Where Mountains Touch Heaven and Railways Defy Gravity</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The approach to Flåm is the opening act of something extraordinary. Our ship threaded through the Aurlandsfjord, mountains rising vertically from mirror-still water, waterfalls dropping from heights that made passengers gasp. And then – tucked into a valley so green it hurt – the tiny village of Flåm appeared. Maybe 400 souls live here. Today, two cruise ships had brought 5,000 visitors. Norway handles this better than you'd expect.</p>

        <p>Everyone comes for the Flåm Railway – and for good reason. It's the steepest standard-gauge railway in Europe, covering 20 km with 80% of the journey on a 5.5% gradient. The line climbs 864 meters from sea level to Myrdal station, passing through 20 tunnels (18 carved by hand), including one that makes a complete 180-degree turn inside the mountain. National Geographic Traveler calls it one of Europe's top 10 train journeys. Lonely Planet named it one of the best train rides in the world.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Took My Breath:</strong> The train stopped at Kjosfossen waterfall and everyone piled out to photograph the cascade. Then – I'm not making this up – a woman in flowing red appeared on the rocks, dancing to haunting music, disappearing into the mist. A huldra, the Norwegian folklore spirit. Theatrical magic in the middle of nature's grandeur.

        <h2>The Flåm Railway</h2>
        <p>Book this the moment you know your ship is calling at Flåm. Seriously – tickets sell out, especially for morning departures. The round trip takes about 2 hours, and sitting on the left side going up (right coming down) gives you the best waterfall views, though honestly both sides are spectacular.</p>
        <p>At Myrdal, you can connect to the main Bergen-Oslo railway for a quick trip toward either city, but most cruisers return on the next Flåm train. The station at Myrdal sits on a snowy plateau that feels like another world – alpine and austere compared to the lush fjord valley below.</p>
        <p>If trains aren't your thing (impossible, but okay), the same route is popular for cycling – all downhill from Myrdal, through tunnels and alongside waterfalls, ending in Flåm. Several companies rent bikes and provide shuttle service. It's exhilarating and slightly terrifying.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Stegastein Viewpoint</h2>
        <p>The Stegastein viewing platform juts 30 meters out over the Aurlandsfjord, supported by wooden beams that seem insufficient for the task. Standing on the glass floor, fjord 650 meters below, is either exhilarating or terrifying depending on your relationship with heights. The view is among Norway's finest – the fjord stretching endlessly, mountains on all sides.</p>
        <p>Buses run from Flåm to Stegastein, or you can combine it with a rental car for a scenic loop. The road itself, with its switchbacks and tunnels, is part of the experience. Budget 2-3 hours if you're serious about photographs and contemplation.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>The Village Itself</h2>
        <p>Flåm village is smaller than your ship's passenger manifest, which gives it a charming absurdity on cruise days. The Flåm Railway Museum documents how they built this impossible railway – free admission and genuinely interesting. The Ægir Brewpub occupies a building shaped like a Viking longhouse and serves excellent local craft beer.</p>
        <p>For quieter experiences, kayak rentals let you paddle into fjord stillness, seeing the scenery from water level. The Flåm Marina offers short fjord cruises to Nærøyfjord, a UNESCO World Heritage arm so narrow the mountains seem close enough to touch.</p>
        <p>Norwegian waffles with brunost (brown cheese) are the local indulgence. The sweetness of the cheese against the crispy waffle sounds wrong and tastes divine. Add cloudberry jam if available.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>How do I book the Flåm Railway?</summary><p>Book online at visitflam.com as soon as your cruise is confirmed. Ship excursions include guaranteed tickets but cost more. Independent booking saves money if you're comfortable managing your own time.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Flåm worth it on a rainy day?</summary><p>Absolutely – waterfalls are more dramatic, mist adds mystery, and the fjords are hauntingly beautiful in gray weather. The railway runs regardless. Pack layers and waterproofs.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Can I do both the railway and Stegastein?</summary><p>Yes, but it's tight. Take an early train, return mid-morning, then bus to Stegastein. Or do Stegastein first thing and catch an afternoon train. Planning is essential.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>How expensive is Norway?</summary><p>Very. A simple lunch can easily cost $30-40 USD. Coffee is $6-8. Beer at the brewpub is $12-15. Budget accordingly, or eat a big breakfast on the ship before exploring.</p></details>
