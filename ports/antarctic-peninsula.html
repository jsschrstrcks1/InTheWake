          <h1>Antarctic Peninsula Cruise Guide</h1>
          <p class="port-intro">
            The Antarctic Peninsula is Earth's final frontier — an 800-mile spine of mountains, glaciers, and ice shelves extending toward South America. This is where most expedition cruises make their landings, offering intimate encounters with penguin colonies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, curious seals lounging on ice floes, and whales feeding in pristine waters.

          <h2>From the Logbook</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "The Zodiac crunched onto the pebble beach at Neko Harbour, and within seconds we were surrounded by gentoo penguins going about their business as if we weren't there. The smell hit first — that unmistakable musky penguin odor that somehow becomes endearing. Behind us, a massive glacier calved with a thunderous crack, sending waves rippling across the bay. We had twenty minutes until the next group arrived. In that moment, standing among thousands of penguins beneath Antarctic peaks, I understood why explorers gave everything to reach this place."
            </p>

          </blockquote>
          <p class="highlight">
            <strong>Highlight:</strong> Watching a leopard seal surface just feet from our Zodiac, its spotted coat glistening, eyes tracking us with intelligent curiosity before slipping silently back beneath the ice-blue water.

          <h2>Popular Landing Sites</h2>
          <p>
            IAATO (International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators) manages over 200 designated landing sites. Weather and ice conditions determine which sites are accessible on any given day. Popular peninsula landings include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Neko Harbour</strong> — Mainland Antarctica landing, gentoo colony, dramatic glacier backdrop</li>
            <li><strong>Paradise Harbour</strong> — Aptly named bay, Argentine research station, Zodiac cruising among icebergs</li>
            <li><strong>Port Lockroy</strong> — Historic British base, post office, museum, gentoo penguins</li>
            <li><strong>Cuverville Island</strong> — Massive gentoo penguin colony, iceberg alley approach</li>
            <li><strong>Deception Island</strong> — Active volcanic caldera, hot springs, abandoned whaling station</li>
            <li><strong>Lemaire Channel</strong> — Scenic cruising through narrow passage, towering cliffs</li>
            <li><strong>Petermann Island</strong> — Southernmost gentoo colony, Adelie penguins</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Wildlife Encounters</h2>
          <p>
            The Antarctic Peninsula hosts an extraordinary concentration of wildlife during the austral summer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Penguins</strong> — Gentoo, chinstrap, and Adelie penguins breed in massive colonies. Approach distances are regulated, but penguins often approach visitors</li>
            <li><strong>Seals</strong> — Leopard seals (apex predators), Weddell seals, crabeater seals, elephant seals on beaches</li>
            <li><strong>Whales</strong> — Humpback whales are common, often bubble-net feeding. Orcas hunt in pods. Minke whales surface near Zodiacs</li>
            <li><strong>Seabirds</strong> — Wandering albatross, southern giant petrels, skuas, blue-eyed cormorants</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Expedition Logistics</h2>
          <p>
            Antarctic Peninsula landings require proper preparation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Zodiac boarding</strong> — Wear waterproof boots (often provided). Wet or dry landings depending on site</li>
            <li><strong>IAATO guidelines</strong> — Maximum 100 passengers ashore at once. Maintain 5-meter distance from wildlife (unless they approach you)</li>
            <li><strong>Biosecurity</strong> — Vacuum all gear before departure. Boot washing stations before/after each landing</li>
            <li><strong>Weather dependency</strong> — Landings canceled in high winds, poor visibility, or dangerous swells. Flexibility essential</li>
            <li><strong>Duration</strong> — Typical landing 1.5-2.5 hours. Often two landings per day when conditions allow</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Research Stations</h2>
          <p>
            The Antarctic Peninsula has the highest concentration of research stations in Antarctica. Some welcome cruise visitors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Port Lockroy (UK)</strong> — Historic base turned museum, operational post office, gentoo colony</li>
            <li><strong>Vernadsky Station (Ukraine)</strong> — Offers bar visits, vodka, and souvenirs</li>
            <li><strong>Almirante Brown (Argentina)</strong> — Paradise Bay, limited access</li>
            <li><strong>Palmer Station (USA)</strong> — Anvers Island, occasional tours for American expedition ships</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Practical Information</h2>

            <li><strong>Temperature</strong> — 20-40°F (-6 to 4°C) typical during landings</li>
            <li><strong>Daylight</strong> — Near 24-hour daylight in December/January</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing</strong> — Expedition parka (usually provided), waterproof pants, layers, warm hat, gloves</li>

            <summary>How do you land on the Antarctic Peninsula?</summary>
            <p>
              Landings are made via Zodiac inflatable boats. Ships anchor offshore and Zodiacs ferry passengers to shore. IAATO regulations limit landings to 100 passengers at a time. Dry landings on rocks or wet landings through shallow water are typical. Expedition staff assist with boarding and disembarking.

          <details>
            <summary>What wildlife can you see on the Antarctic Peninsula?</summary>
            <p>
              The Antarctic Peninsula hosts massive penguin colonies (gentoo, chinstrap, Adelie), leopard seals, Weddell seals, humpback whales, orcas, and numerous seabirds including albatross and petrels. Wildlife is remarkably unafraid of humans due to the absence of land predators.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>When is the best time to cruise the Antarctic Peninsula?</summary>
            <p>
              November-March is the Antarctic summer. November-December offers pristine snow and penguin courtship rituals. January-February has the warmest temperatures (up to 40°F) and penguin chicks. March sees increased whale activity and dramatic late-season lighting.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can you set foot on mainland Antarctica?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Neko Harbour and Paradise Harbour are popular landing sites on the Antarctic continent itself (not just islands). You'll receive a certificate for "setting foot on the 7th continent."
