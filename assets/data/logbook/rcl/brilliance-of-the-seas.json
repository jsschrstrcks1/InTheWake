      "markdown": "**I'd avoided cruising for years because I thought I'd feel trapped. Brilliance proved me completely wrong.**\n\nMy wife had been begging me to try a cruise for a decade. I kept refusing—claustrophobia concerns, memories of windowless hotel rooms, fear of being stuck on a floating mall. Then she showed me photos of Brilliance's glass elevators and floor-to-ceiling windows. \"It's basically a greenhouse that floats,\" she said.\n\nShe wasn't exaggerating. From the moment we stepped aboard, the ship felt open, airy, connected to the outside world. The [Centrum](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) rises multiple decks with glass walls on every level. The elevators are glass capsules that let you watch the ocean while you ride. Even the indoor pool in the [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) has a retractable glass roof.\n\nI never once felt trapped. That was the revelation that changed everything for me.\n\nOur balcony cabin had floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that made the room feel twice its size. We'd wake up, open the curtains, and there was Alaska—mountains, glaciers, eagles, whales—right there, no barrier between us and the world. The connection to nature was constant, immersive, and genuinely therapeutic.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), our table faced a wall of windows overlooking the wake. At breakfast in [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), we watched icebergs drift past while eating eggs. Even the hallways have windows at every turn, natural light flooding spaces that would be dark corridors on older ships.\n\nRadiance Class ships were designed for scenery-intensive itineraries—Alaska, Norway, New Zealand—and it shows. Every design choice prioritizes views. You're never more than a few steps from seeing the ocean, the mountains, the world you came to experience.\n\n**The lesson:** If claustrophobia has kept you from cruising, try a Radiance Class ship. Brilliance's glass-forward design solved a problem I thought was unsolvable. See [our first-timer's guide](/articles.html) for more tips on choosing the right ship.",

      "markdown": "**Four people, seven nights, Alaska. Total cost: $4,200. Everyone said it couldn't be done.**\n\nWe'd been saving for an Alaska cruise for three years. Every quote we got was $6,000-8,000 for a family of four. Then I discovered Brilliance's repositioning cruises and shoulder-season sailings. Same glaciers. Same ports. Same whales. Just an older ship and less crowded departure dates.\n\nOur cabin was an ocean-view on Deck 7—not a balcony, but with those signature Radiance Class windows, it hardly mattered. The glass went nearly floor to ceiling. We watched Glacier Bay from our room while the kids ate room service breakfast in their pajamas. No balcony required for spectacular views.\n\nThe [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) became our family headquarters. Free breakfast, free lunch, and the kids could grab pizza anytime. We did one specialty dinner at [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html) to celebrate my daughter's birthday—$50 per adult, kids free with their meal—and ate in the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) every other night. The food was excellent, the service impeccable, and it cost us nothing extra.\n\nExcursions are where Alaska gets expensive. We skipped the helicopter tours and $500 dog sledding. Instead: free ranger-led walks in Juneau, $20 bus tours in Ketchikan, and whale watching from the ship's deck (free, and we saw dozens). The kids still talk about the humpback that breached fifty feet from our balcony.\n\nBrilliance isn't the newest ship, but here's what matters: the glaciers don't care what ship you arrived on. Hubbard Glacier calved just as dramatically for us as it did for the people on the brand-new ships paying twice our rate.\n\n**Budget breakdown:** Cruise fare $2,800. Gratuities $400. Two excursions $300. One specialty dinner $150. Souvenirs $300. Flights $250 (we drove to the port). Total: $4,200 for an experience our kids will remember forever.\n\nSee our [Alaska cruise budget guide](/planning.html) for detailed tips.",

      "markdown": "**I'm an introvert who married an extrovert. Brilliance's Solarium kept our marriage intact.**\n\nMy husband wanted a cruise. I wanted a week of reading by quiet water. The compromise: Brilliance of the Seas, with its legendary adults-only [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html)—a glass-enclosed retreat at the front of the ship where children aren't allowed and peace is actually possible.\n\nEvery morning, I'd grab coffee from [Café Latte-tudes](/restaurants.html), find a lounger in the Solarium, and disappear into whatever book I'd brought. The retractable glass roof meant warmth even in Alaska's cool air. The pool was calm—no cannonballs, no Marco Polo, no shrieking. Just adults reading, napping, watching the scenery, and quietly existing in comfortable silence.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband explored every inch of the ship, played trivia in every bar, made friends with half the passengers, and came back buzzing with energy. He'd find me in the Solarium around 4pm, refreshed from his social marathon, and I'd be equally refreshed from my solitary one. We'd share highlights over dinner in the main dining room.\n\nThe design is genius. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap around the space, so you're bathed in natural light and ocean views even when the roof is closed. The hot tubs are warm and uncrowded. The bar serves drinks without you having to leave your chair. It's like a spa experience without the spa prices.\n\nI spent probably twenty hours in the Solarium over seven days. Read four books. Took countless naps. Watched Alaska slide past through those massive windows. Had exactly the vacation I needed while my husband had his.\n\n**The lesson for introverts:** You don't have to be \"on\" for an entire cruise. Brilliance's Solarium is a legitimate sanctuary. Claim your spot early, tip your server well, and let the extroverts exhaust themselves elsewhere. See [our introvert's cruise guide](/articles.html) for more quiet-space recommendations.",

      "markdown": "**Fourteen family members. Ages 8 to 78. One ship. Zero disasters. I'm the 78-year-old.**\n\nPlanning a multigenerational trip usually means someone compromises. Grandma can't keep up with the kids. The teenagers are bored by the adults. Someone's always waiting for someone else. But Brilliance's layout somehow worked for everyone.\n\nThe ship is big enough to have real activities but small enough that we'd randomly bump into each other all day. Grandpa taking his morning walk would find the kids at the pool. The teenagers getting coffee would run into their aunt at the [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html). We never had to coordinate—the ship did it for us.\n\nGrandma loved the [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html)—warm, quiet, adults-only. She'd camp there every afternoon with her crossword puzzles while the rest of us wore ourselves out. Grandpa discovered the library and read three novels he'd been meaning to finish for years. Neither felt left out; they felt *rested*.\n\nThe kids bounced between Adventure Ocean and the pool deck, making friends with other kids and appearing at meals sunburned and happy. The teenagers found the rock climbing wall and the video arcade, emerging only when forced.\n\nDinners were magic. We had a long table in the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card)—all fourteen of us, same server every night. Antonio learned everyone's preferences by day two. Grandma's decaf arrived before she asked. The kids' chicken fingers came first so they could eat and fidget. The adults got wine recommendations. It felt like a private restaurant.\n\nAt Glacier Bay, we all gathered at the glass walls on Deck 10. Three generations watching ancient ice crash into the sea. My mother-in-law held my daughter's hand. My son asked his grandfather questions about geology. Nobody was looking at phones.\n\n**The truth:** Multigenerational trips are hard. But Brilliance's mid-size design—not too big, not too small—somehow accommodated everyone without exhausting anyone. See [our multigenerational planning guide](/articles.html).",

      "markdown": "**Everyone said Alaska wasn't romantic. Everyone was wrong.**\n\nWhen we announced our honeymoon destination, the reactions were... skeptical. \"Alaska? For a honeymoon? It's cold! There are bears! Where's the beach?\" My mother actually asked if we were having problems already.\n\nWe booked Brilliance anyway. Best decision of our married life so far, without question.\n\nThe romance isn't beaches and umbrella drinks—it's watching humpback whales breach at sunset while wrapped in blankets on your private balcony. It's glacier calving that sounds like thunder, holding hands because nature is literally roaring at you. It's bald eagles circling overhead while you eat breakfast, and your new spouse saying \"I can't believe this is our life now.\"\n\nBrilliance's glass-wall design made everything feel intimate despite the ship's size. Our [balcony cabin](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) had floor-to-ceiling windows that made the room feel enormous. We'd order room service breakfast and eat in bed watching mountains drift past. Romantic? Incredibly so.\n\n[Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html) became our anniversary-dinner-in-advance spot—candlelit, quiet, with windows overlooking the wake. The sommelier learned we were newlyweds and kept bringing \"just a taste\" of wines we hadn't ordered. By dessert, we were slightly tipsy and completely in love.\n\nThe Solarium's couples' hot tub overlooking the bow became our nightly ritual. Warm water, cold air, stars appearing as Alaska's summer twilight finally faded. Other couples had the same idea—we met three other honeymooners and ended up having drinks together on the last night of our voyage.\n\nAdventure during the day, romance at night. Kayaking through icebergs, then champagne on the balcony. Hiking through rainforests, then spa treatments. Alaska honeymoons work because you experience things *together*—not lying on separate beach chairs scrolling phones and missing the moment.\n\n**The lesson:** Romance doesn't require tropics. It requires shared wonder. And Alaska on Brilliance delivers wonder constantly. See [our honeymoon planning guide](/planning.html).",

      "markdown": "**My father hadn't taken a real vacation in twelve years. We basically kidnapped him onto Brilliance.**\n\nDad's a small business owner. Sixty-seven years old, works six days a week, checks email during family dinners, hasn't been unreachable since cell phones were invented. Mom had been begging him to retire, or at least slow down. He'd nod, promise to \"think about it,\" and go right back to the office.\n\nFor his 67th birthday, we didn't give him a choice. Booked an Alaska cruise, took his laptop (physically removed it from his bag), and told him he could call us ungrateful children from the ship's spotty satellite wifi if he wanted.\n\nThe first two days were rough. He paced. He checked his phone constantly. He complained about the wifi being slow. Mom almost threw him overboard.\n\nThen, on day three, something shifted. We were sailing through Glacier Bay, and Dad was sitting in the [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html), probably calculating lost revenue, when a chunk of ice the size of a car crashed off Margerie Glacier. The sound was like cannon fire. The splash reached our deck.\n\nDad stopped. Stared. Said nothing for ten minutes. Then: \"I forgot things like this existed.\"\n\nBy day five, he was the one dragging us to viewing decks. He befriended the naturalist and asked questions like a curious kid. He left his phone in the cabin \"by accident.\" At [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), he ordered a second bottle of wine and told stories about his own father that we'd never heard.\n\nThe cruise didn't fix everything—he's still a workaholic—but something cracked open. He's taken two vacations since. He talks about retirement now like it might actually happen.\n\n**The lesson:** Sometimes people need to be removed from their environment to remember who they are outside of it. Alaska's scale has a way of making spreadsheets seem small. See [our guide to unplugging](/articles.html).",

Brilliance was the first where I felt like a guest, not a problem to solve.**\n\nSpinal cord injury, power wheelchair, fifteen years of figuring out what works and what doesn't. Most ships tolerate wheelchair users. Brilliance actually accommodated us—there's a meaningful difference.\n\nThe [accessible cabin](/solo/accessible-cruising.html) was genuinely thoughtful. Roll-in shower with a proper bench and hand-held sprayer. Grab bars positioned by someone who understands how bodies actually move. Enough floor space to maneuver my chair without playing furniture Tetris. The balcony door was wide enough to roll through—I could sit outside independently for the first time on any cruise.\n\nBut the real test is public spaces, and Brilliance passed with flying colors. The [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) buffet had aisles wide enough to navigate during busy periods. The [main dining room](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) reserved accessible tables with clear sightlines and room for my chair. The theater had wheelchair spots with actual views, not afterthought corners.\n\nElevators were the revelation. Glass-walled and spacious, never more than a few minutes away, and during off-peak times, reliably empty. I could get from cabin to Solarium in under five minutes—unheard of on mega-ships where elevators require strategic planning.\n\nThe crew made the difference. Our room steward learned my routine without me explaining. Servers moved chairs before I had to ask. The excursion desk researched genuinely accessible tours rather than just checking a box. When I asked about tender ports, they gave me honest assessments: \"Juneau is fine, Ketchikan might be challenging, here's why.\"\n\n**The specifics:** Brilliance has accessible cabins on multiple decks. All public venues have wheelchair access. The pool has a lift. Tenders are tricky but manageable with advance notice. The spa can accommodate wheelchair users with advance booking.\n\nSee [our accessible cruising guide](/solo/accessible-cruising.html) for detailed ship-by-ship accessibility ratings.",

Alaska from Brilliance gave me the best shots of my career.**\n\nI'm a semi-professional photographer—weddings pay the bills, but landscapes fill my portfolio. When I booked Brilliance's Alaska cruise, I packed two camera bodies, four lenses, and modest expectations. I came home with 4,000 images and a completely recalibrated sense of what's possible.\n\nRadiance Class ships were designed for photography, even if Royal Caribbean didn't intend it. Those signature glass walls mean you can shoot from inside the ship in any weather. At Glacier Bay, rain was pounding the deck, but I was warm and dry behind floor-to-ceiling windows, capturing ice calving in perfect focus. Try that on an older ship with tiny portholes.\n\nThe [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) became my sunrise studio. Glass roof, glass walls, 270-degree views of whatever we were sailing past. I'd set up at 4am (Alaska summer means early light), tripod stabilized against ship motion, and shoot for hours. The staff learned to leave coffee near my gear without interrupting.\n\nBalcony positioning matters. I booked a forward-facing cabin specifically for unobstructed bow shots. Wildlife appears ahead of the ship—whales, eagles, sea otters—and forward balconies see them first. Worth the premium for serious photographers who want the best shots.\n\n**Gear that worked:** Wide-angle for glaciers and scenery. Long telephoto (200-600mm) for wildlife. Polarizing filter essential for cutting glare off water. Waterproof bag for deck shooting in rain. Monopod more practical than tripod given ship movement.\n\n**Best shooting locations on Brilliance:** Deck 10 forward observation area (uncrowded, excellent angles). Solarium at sunrise. Your balcony during glacier approaches. The glass elevators for creative interior shots.\n\nMy Alaska portfolio has generated more client inquiries than anything else I've shot. The investment paid for itself handsomely.\n\nSee [our cruise photography guide](/articles.html) for detailed tips on capturing memories at sea.",

For a year, I couldn't imagine traveling—we'd planned to see Alaska together, and going alone felt like betrayal. But grief doesn't shrink if you stay home. It just gets stale.\n\nI chose Brilliance because friends recommended it for solo travelers. Mid-sized ship, manageable layout, glass walls everywhere so you're never far from nature. What I didn't expect was how the design would support grief—all those windows meant I could cry watching glaciers without anyone noticing.\n\nGlacier Bay was the turning point. Standing at the [viewing windows](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) on Deck 10, watching ice that's been forming for thousands of years crash into water, I felt it: my loss is real, but it's not the whole story. The world is enormous and ancient and continuing. Tom is gone, but creation keeps creating.\n\nI'm not saying grief disappeared. It didn't. I still cried at dinner sometimes. I still wished he was there when the whales breached. But the scale of Alaska put things in perspective. My pain is real AND the world is beautiful. Both things, at once.\n\nThe crew was kind without being intrusive. The [Solarium](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) gave me quiet space when I needed it. Other solo travelers invited me to join them without pressuring. I was alone but not lonely—a distinction I hadn't known was possible before this trip.\n\n**What helped:** Bringing his photo for the balcony. Writing him letters I threw into the ocean at Glacier Bay. Letting myself feel sad without fighting it. Letting myself feel joy without guilt when it arrived.\n\nSee [In the Wake of Grief](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html) for more on traveling through loss and finding renewal.",
