      "markdown": "**Statendam started S-Class. Veendam completed it.**\n\n[Veendam](/ships/holland-america-line/veendam.html) arrived in 1996 as the fifth and final S-Class ship, incorporating everything HAL learned across four prior vessels. The conclusion of a successful class.\n\nShe served for nearly a quarter century—outlasting expectations, adapting to changing times, maintaining relevance. The S-Class design proved remarkably durable.\n\nWhen Veendam finally retired, all S-Class ships had completed their HAL service. The class that defined the 1990s concluded its work.\n\n**The completion:** Veendam represented S-Class perfected. The final ship that benefited from all lessons learned.\n\nFleet historians recognize Veendam's significance. The ship that concluded a defining era.",

Veendam showed us perfectly.**\n\n[Veendam](/ships/holland-america-line/veendam.html) sailed Canada and New England fall foliage itineraries that delivered autumn at intimate scale. Portland to Halifax. Boston to Québec. The colors compressed into voyages of pure beauty.\n\nHer S-Class size meant ports absorbed us gracefully. Bar Harbor remained charming. Peggy's Cove stayed authentic. The smaller footprint enabled genuine encounters with New England communities.\n\nWe photographed colors we still display in our homes. The viewing from Veendam's decks created perspectives roads cannot provide.\n\n**The season:** Veendam delivered fall foliage beautifully. The autumn voyages that created lasting memories.\n\nThose who saw autumn from Veendam remember the colors. The season experienced perfectly.",

Faces became familiar. Crew learned names. The ship felt like community rather than floating city.\n\nWe could find the same seat in the same lounge every day. Our waiter knew our preferences. The experience accumulated into relationship rather than anonymous transaction.\n\nThe S-Class design enabled this intimacy. Large enough for programming, small enough for recognition. The balance that worked.\n\n**The scale:** Veendam demonstrated what intimacy provides. The size that enables real cruising.\n\nThose who valued smaller ships found Veendam perfect. The intimacy they sought, reliably delivered.",
