Summer seasons in the Med, repositioning transatlantic crossings in spring and fall, occasional Caribbean winters.\n\nEuropean cruisers developed loyalty to Splendour specifically. She wasn't the newest or largest ship, but she was *right-sized* for European ports—small enough to dock in Santorini, Dubrovnik, and Venice (ports that mega-ships couldn't access), big enough to offer Royal Caribbean's signature service and entertainment.",

Not too big to feel impersonal, not too small to lack amenities.\"\n\n\"The transatlantic crossings were bucket-list experiences.

Norwegian fjords, Greek coastlines, you didn't want to miss the views.\"\n\n\"When Royal Caribbean sold her in 2016, European cruisers lost a gem. The newer ships are impressive, but they can't dock where Splendour could.\"\n\n**Documented achievements:**\n- Sailed Mediterranean itineraries for over 15 consecutive summers\n- Completed dozens of transatlantic crossings, becoming a favorite for passengers who preferred sea days over port-hopping\n- Accessed smaller European ports that larger ships (Voyager, Oasis class) couldn't reach\n- Maintained high satisfaction scores despite being one of the older Vision-class ships\n\n**Life after Royal Caribbean:**\n\nIn 2016, Royal Caribbean sold Splendour to TUI Cruises (UK market). She was refurbished, renamed Marella Discovery, and continues sailing Mediterranean and European itineraries as of 2025.\n\nUnlike many retired ships that were scrapped, Splendour received a second career.

      "markdown": "**I booked Splendour's spring repositioning cruise from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale. Seven consecutive sea days. Best cruise decision I ever made.**\n\nMost cruisers want ports. They want beach days, shore excursions, port shopping. They treat the ship as transportation between destinations.\n\nTransatlantic crossings flip that entirely. The ship IS the destination. No ports. No excursions. Just you, the ocean, and seven days of uninterrupted shipboard life.\n\n**What made Splendour's transatlantic special:**\n\nThe daily routine became meditative. Wake up. Coffee on the balcony, watching the Atlantic. Breakfast at your own pace—no rush to disembark. Morning enrichment lectures: navigation, maritime history, destination briefings. Afternoon by the pool or in the library. Cocktails at Viking Crown Lounge as the sun set. Formal dinners that felt earned.\n\nSplendour was right-sized for transatlantic. Small enough to feel like a community—you recognized faces, made friends, had dinner companions. Large enough to never feel trapped—multiple bars, lounges, activities, deck space.\n\n**The people:**\n\nTransatlantic cruisers are different. They're not chasing beaches or shopping. They're often retired, experienced travelers, people who value the journey over destinations. Conversations were deeper. Connections felt more genuine.\n\nI met a couple from London on day two. By day five, we were sharing life stories over wine. We've stayed in touch for years.\n\n**The practical truth:**\n\nSeven sea days sounds long. It isn't. The days flew by. I read four books. I attended every lecture. I tried every bar. I watched dolphins from the bow. I saw bioluminescence in the ship's wake at midnight.\n\nWhen we docked in Fort Lauderdale, I didn't want to leave. The ocean had become home.\n\nSplendour no longer sails for Royal Caribbean, but repositioning cruises still exist on other ships. If you've never done a transatlantic: do it. It's cruising in its purest form.\n\nSee our [repositioning cruise guide](/planning.html) for current options.",

      "markdown": "**Our honeymoon cruise on Splendour started in Venice. We watched St. Mark's Square disappear as we sailed through the lagoon. Nothing has topped that moment.**\n\nWe chose Splendour specifically because she could dock in Venice. The mega-ships anchored in industrial ports, requiring water taxis into the city. Splendour sailed directly into the Venice cruise terminal—walk off the ship, walk into history.\n\nThat pattern repeated throughout the cruise.\n\n**The ports:**\n\nDubrovnik: Docked at the cruise port, walked along the old city walls within minutes. No tender boats, no shuttles, no wasted time.\n\nSantorini: This port required a tender, but Splendour's smaller size meant shorter queues and more flexibility. We had morning coffee watching the caldera, then spent the entire day exploring Oia.\n\nBarcelona: Docked at the main terminal, walked to Las Ramblas. The city felt accessible, not distant.\n\n**Why size mattered:**\n\nOasis-class ships (225,000 GT) carry 6,000+ passengers. They overwhelm small ports. They anchor offshore and tender thousands of people in waves. They create crowds that spoil the experience.\n\nSplendour (69,000 GT) carried 1,800 passengers. We never felt like an invasion force. Ports felt welcoming, not overwhelmed. Local restaurants could accommodate us. Cobblestone streets weren't packed.\n\n**The romance factor:**\n\nEvery evening, we'd watch the sunset from Viking Crown Lounge—360-degree glass walls, the Mediterranean turning gold and pink, no noise except quiet conversation and clinking glasses.\n\nFormal nights in the dining room felt elegant, not rushed. Our server remembered our wine preference by night two. The maitre d' sent champagne to our table when he learned we were honeymooners.\n\nSmaller ship, bigger moments.\n\nSplendour is gone from Royal Caribbean, but [Brilliance](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) and [Serenade](/ships/rcl/serenade-of-the-seas.html) still offer similar Mediterranean experiences on right-sized ships.\n\nSee our [Mediterranean cruise guide](/ports.html) for current itinerary options.",

      "markdown": "**Vision Class ships weren't just ships. They were architectural statements. Splendour exemplified everything the class represented.**\n\nWhen Royal Caribbean launched Legend of the Seas in 1995 (the first Vision-class ship), the industry noticed something different: glass everywhere. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining room. Glass elevators in the atrium. The Viking Crown Lounge wrapped entirely in glass. Even the health center had ocean views.\n\nSplendour, launched in 1996, perfected the concept.\n\n**Why glass mattered:**\n\nBefore Vision Class, cruise ships were designed like floating hotels—interior-focused, minimal windows, artificial lighting. You could forget you were at sea.\n\nVision Class made the ocean inescapable. Every meal, every walk, every elevator ride reminded you that you were sailing across water. The glass walls transformed cruising from \"traveling on a ship\" to \"experiencing the ocean.\"\n\n**Splendour's design signatures:**\n\nThe seven-story Centrum atrium: glass elevators ascending through the heart of the ship, natural light flooding every level.\n\nViking Crown Lounge: perched at the top, wrapped in glass, 360-degree views that made every sunset a private show.\n\nWindjammer Café: wall-to-wall windows, breakfast with Mediterranean coastlines or Atlantic horizons as backdrop.\n\nEven the corridors had windows at each end—you could always orient yourself by looking at the ocean.\n\n**The legacy:**\n\nVision Class proved that passengers wanted connection to the sea, not isolation from it. Every Royal Caribbean ship since has incorporated glass design elements: the AquaTheater on Oasis Class, the observation pods on Quantum Class, the glass-bottom Overlook Bar on Icon Class.\n\nSplendour and her sisters didn't just carry passengers—they changed how cruise ships were designed.\n\nExplore Vision-class ships still sailing: [Grandeur](/ships/rcl/grandeur-of-the-seas.html), [Rhapsody](/ships/rcl/rhapsody-of-the-seas.html), [Vision](/ships/rcl/vision-of-the-seas.html), [Enchantment](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html).",

      "markdown": "**My father used a wheelchair. We cruised Splendour three times before she was sold. Here's what worked—and what didn't.**\n\n**What worked:**\n\nCompact layout. Splendour was small enough that Dad could navigate independently. Cabin to dining room: five minutes. Cabin to pool: three minutes. Everything was reachable without exhaustion.\n\nElevators. Vision-class glass elevators were positioned centrally and rarely overcrowded. Dad never waited more than two minutes. On larger ships, elevator waits could hit ten minutes during peak times.\n\nAccessible cabin design. The accessible cabin had wide doorways, roll-in shower, grab bars, lowered closet rods. Not perfect, but functional. The balcony was large enough for the wheelchair.\n\nCrew attitude. The staff learned Dad's routine and anticipated needs. Our cabin steward knew when to have the room ready. The dining staff had his table prepared. Small ship meant personal recognition.\n\n**What didn't work:**\n\nTender ports. Santorini, Montenegro, some Greek islands required tender boats. Getting Dad's wheelchair onto tenders was challenging. We sometimes skipped tender ports entirely.\n\nPool access. No lift into the main pool. The Solarium was more accessible but still required transfers. Dad mostly watched from poolside.\n\nSome public areas. A few bars and lounges had steps without ramps. The casino had tight spacing. The library had narrow aisles.\n\n**The honest assessment:**\n\nSplendour wasn't perfect for wheelchair users, but her size made her more manageable than mega-ships. The crew's attentiveness compensated for design limitations. Dad felt welcome and cared for—that mattered more than perfect accessibility.\n\nFor wheelchair users considering current ships: [Radiance Class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) offers similar compact layouts with updated accessibility features. Mega-ships have more accessible amenities but require much more navigation.\n\nSee our [accessible cruise guide](/accessibility.html) for current recommendations.",

      "markdown": "**Some ships are built for activities. Splendour was built for views. The Norwegian fjords proved it.**\n\nWe sailed Splendour's fjord itinerary three consecutive summers. Same ship, same route, never got old. The glass walls made the experience.\n\n**Why Splendour excelled:**\n\nThe fjords are narrow. Waterfalls cascade feet from the ship. Cliffs rise thousands of feet on both sides. You don't want to be inside—you want to SEE.\n\nSplendour's glass everywhere meant you could watch the scenery from almost any public space. Breakfast in the Windjammer with Geirangerfjord sliding past the windows. Lunch on the pool deck with waterfalls misting the air. Dinner in the main dining room as the sun set over distant peaks.\n\n**The navigation moments:**\n\nNorwegian fjord cruising includes passages that feel impossibly tight. The captain would announce when we were approaching scenic highlights. Everyone would rush to the deck, cameras ready.\n\nSplendour's smaller size meant she could navigate passages that mega-ships couldn't attempt. We visited villages accessible only by sea, docked at piers that couldn't handle larger vessels.\n\n**The family experience:**\n\nMy kids were 10 and 14. They'd grown up on Caribbean cruises, focused on pools and activities. Norway changed their perspective.\n\nWatching a waterfall from feet away. Seeing glaciers calve. Spotting seals and seabirds. The scenery entertained them more than any onboard activity could.\n\nBy the third cruise, they requested Norway specifically. \"It's not about the ship, Mom,\" my daughter said. \"It's about what's outside the ship.\"\n\nThat's what Splendour understood. The ship wasn't the destination—it was the window to the destination.\n\nSplendour no longer sails, but other ships offer Norwegian fjord itineraries. Look for smaller ships with significant deck space and glass walls. The views matter more than the waterslides.\n\nSee our [Norwegian fjord guide](/ports.html) for current cruise options.",

      "markdown": "**I served in the Navy for 30 years. I saw the Mediterranean from warships. Sailing it on Splendour was healing.**\n\nMy wife convinced me to try cruising after retirement. I was skeptical—crowds, confined spaces, forced fun didn't appeal. She suggested Splendour's Mediterranean itinerary because she knew the ports.\n\nShe also knew I needed to see those places differently.\n\n**The revisitation:**\n\nNaples: I'd pulled into Naples harbor dozens of times on destroyers. Always on duty, always focused on operations, never actually saw the city. On Splendour, we toured Pompeii. My wife held my hand as I stood in the ruins, finally experiencing what I'd sailed past for decades.\n\nDubrovnik: I'd tracked naval movements along the Adriatic during the Yugoslav wars. Now I walked the old city walls with my grandchildren, explaining history they were too young to understand but would remember.\n\nBarcelona: I'd anchored offshore for NATO exercises. This time I tasted paella, wandered Gaudí's architecture, sat in quiet squares.\n\n**Why Splendour worked:**\n\nSmaller ship meant less chaos. I could find quiet spaces when I needed them. The library. The aft deck at dawn. The Viking Crown Lounge before breakfast.\n\nThe crew was professional but not intrusive. They reminded me of good sailors—doing their jobs well, anticipating needs, not making a production of it.\n\nThe pace was gentle. We could explore ports or stay aboard. No pressure. No schedules beyond dinner time.\n\n**The peace:**\n\nOn the last night, I stood on the aft deck watching our wake disappear into the darkness. I'd spent 30 years watching wakes from warships—always heading somewhere, always on mission.\n\nThis time, I was just... sailing. No mission. No threat board. No watch rotation. Just the Mediterranean night and the sound of the sea.\n\nMy wife found me there. \"You okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Better than okay,\" I said. \"I finally got to enjoy it.\"\n\nSplendour gave me that. I'll always be grateful.\n\nFor fellow veterans considering Mediterranean cruises: smaller ships like [Brilliance](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) or [Serenade](/ships/rcl/serenade-of-the-seas.html) still offer similar European itineraries.\n\nSee our [veteran travel resources](/planning.html) and [Mediterranean cruise guide](/ports.html).",

Mediterranean loops, transatlantic crossings, even a Caribbean winter sailing when she repositioned. She became \"our\" ship—the one we requested, the one we returned to.\n\nRobert passed in 2014. I sailed the final cruise alone, carrying his memory.\n\n**The farewell atmosphere:**\n\nThe ship was full of Splendour loyalists. People who'd sailed her dozens of times. Crew members who'd been aboard for years. Everyone knew this was the end.\n\nThe captain made special announcements throughout the cruise, sharing Splendour's history and achievements. The crew seemed to move a little slower, savor moments a little longer. Even the formal nights felt more meaningful—people dressed up like they were honoring the ship, not just following dress codes.\n\n**The connections:**\n\nI met a couple from Germany who'd sailed Splendour 23 times. A British widow, like me, whose late husband had proposed in Viking Crown Lounge. A family from Australia who'd chosen Splendour for every European vacation for 15 years.\n\nWe exchanged stories over wine. Compared favorite ports. Shared memories of crew members long since transferred. Laughed about adventures. Cried about losses.\n\nBy the last night, strangers had become family.\n\n**The final departure:**\n\nIn Barcelona, as passengers disembarked for the last time, crew members lined the gangway. Many had tears in their eyes. They weren't just saying goodbye to passengers—they were saying goodbye to their shipboard home.\n\nI touched the railing one last time. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. \"For everything.\"\n\nSplendour sailed to TUI shortly after, becoming Marella Discovery. She's still out there, still sailing European waters. Different name, different crew, but the glass walls and Viking Crown Lounge remain.\n\nSometimes I imagine Robert there still, watching the sunset from our favorite spot.\n\nFor those who sailed Splendour: she's not forgotten.
