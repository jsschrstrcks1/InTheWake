You pay the same great price you’d see on Royal Caribbean’s site, and your clicks help keep our free research afloat.\n\n## Intro\nBoarding at Port Canaveral with kids, grandparents, and a carry-on stuffed with chargers and snacks felt like herding cats through the atrium — until we stepped into Adventure of the Seas and the chaos turned to awe. Our multigenerational crew (teens, a grade-schooler, a toddler, and grandpa in a wheelchair) found a floating playground where every age got a win. **Price check (our price):** Inside came in around **~$759 pp**, and a Balcony for extended family closer to **~$1,079 pp** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\n\n*Book your family’s Adventure of the Seas* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrom day one, bartenders remembered our sodas and lemonades, and room stewards learned nap schedules so the toddler could crash without the vacuum cameo. Porters handled the big bags landside; we rolled aboard light and happy. The way staff anticipated wheelchair moments — opening doors, guiding us to elevators without fuss — made the ship feel like it was designed for us. Smiles in the salty breeze, names learned fast, and patience that never ran dry.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nStudio B’s ice show had our teens filming spins like sports highlights; “Can’t Stop the Rock” turned the theater into a sing-along. I face-planted on the FlowRider and got a sticky-soft-serve high-five from the nine-year-old next door. Arcade duels, promenade parades, and late-night pub singalongs meant somebody was always declaring it the *best day ever*.\n\n## Dining\nWindjammer was our varsity buffet — tacos, salads, and kid-approved pasta — while **Chops Grille** delivered the “whoa” steaks. **Giovanni’s Table** became nonna-energy comfort. The Main Dining Room handled our one nut allergy cleanly, no drama. *Packing sanity saver:* our family list that kept cords, meds, and sippy-cup lids in line → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-dining\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nThe Royal app smoothed the whole thing — photos, docs, arrival time — and we were boarding smiles-first. In ports like Aruba and Curaçao we **walked down the gangway** straight into color-splashed streets.\n\n## The Real Talk\nSea-day loungers fill early, and Wi-Fi can slow **far out to sea/peak usage**. Nothing show-stopping; it nudged us outside together.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nElevators placed sensibly, theater companion seating, pool lifts ready when asked. One afternoon a crew member gently parked us near a hard-surface route so grandpa’s chair rolled easier. It wasn’t about special treatment — it was about dignity.\n- **Elevator access** to all public decks → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/disability-at-sea.html\n- **Pool/whirlpool lifts** on request\n- **Accessible staterooms** with roll-in showers → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/ships/rcl/adventure-of-the-seas.html#accessible\n- **Priority tendering** where applicable (most calls here were at a pier)\n\n## A Female Perspective\nI felt respected everywhere — from the spa to late-night walks on the promenade. *Bring a light scarf*; the theater runs cool. Formal night ranged from glammed-up gowns to simple chic; no one stared either way. Making friends came easy in line for cappuccinos; the crew never made safety an afterthought.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nFrom toddler giggles to grandpa’s big-band sway, our week stitched together memories in every salty gust. *Summer dates go first — book now* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *Packing list we actually used* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",

When a calendar ping tried to hijack my sea day, I smiled at the “Wi-Fi’s a little busy right now” energy and reclaimed the hour for the hot tub.\n\n## The Real Talk\nLoungers go early and the promenade gets lively — I preferred shaded perches and off-peak laps. Wi-Fi slows **far out to sea/peak usage** — which is convenient when you need a meeting-dodging excuse.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nI travel with intention. I watched crew clear pathways, guide wheelchairs to elevators, and set pool lifts with calm care.

Formal night ran the spectrum; I wore a sleek dress and felt perfectly at home. The spa facial + steam became my reset; I made two quick friends comparing earrings (yes, I bought the fire-opal pair from the boutique and regret nothing).\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nSeven nights reminded me that joy can be scheduled — and savored. *Claim your week* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *My exact packing picks* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",

I found a quiet corner of the spa for a 30-minute reset and didn’t feel out of place for choosing the short option.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nThis trip was a lifeline — beauty in small moments, healing in sea air. *Grab your week while it’s there* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *What actually made our bag* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",

Boleros rhythms, pub singalongs, and poolside movies gave us plenty to choose from; most nights we chose *each other* and talked late on the balcony like teenagers.\n\n## Dining\nWe used a **3-night specialty package**: **Chops Grille** (perfect filet), **Giovanni’s** (truffle pasta), and **Izumi** for something playful.

      "markdown": "## Disclosure\nAhoy—some links here are affiliate; you snag the same great rate and it helps keep our little lighthouse of cruise research shining.\n\n## Intro\nI’m Elaine, 56, newly unencumbered by school calendars, and the kind of solo traveler who packs a silk scarf “just in case.” Last summer I sailed a week on Royal Caribbean’s Adventure of the Seas, round-trip from Florida, and discovered that going alone doesn’t have to feel lonely. From the first sweep of sea air on the promenade to the last clink of glass in the theater, I found warmth, welcome, and room to breathe.\n\n**Family Fare Watch:** From our window, Balcony hovered near **~$1,099 pp**, Ocean View around **~$949 pp** → Book your solo Adventure (affiliate link above).\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nThe barista on the Promenade learned my name and my “latte, not sweet.” The stateroom attendant noticed I preferred extra pillows and produced them without fuss. And the Boleros team? They greeted me like a regular, with music recommendations and a quiet corner when I wanted to simply listen. I watched crew guide a grandma’s wheelchair through a busy doorway with a soft, “After you,” and it reminded me why these ships are called floating cities—polite ones.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nI’m not a rowdy night-owl, but I didn’t miss a show. The ice performance in Studio B turned the rink into poetry; later, the theater’s live vocals took me back to mixtape years. Afterward I wandered to the pub where a guitarist threaded familiar melodies, and strangers sang like they’d rehearsed all week.\n\n## Dining\nMornings started on my balcony—room-service fruit, a warm pastry, and coffee poured while the horizon unspooled. I rotated dinners: Main Dining Room for slow, elegant courses; Chops Grille for a perfect filet; Giovanni’s when I craved pasta that tasted like a seaside trattoria. Staff handled preferences easily—nothing performative, just confidence. And yes, the late-night Café Promenade cookie became a ritual.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nThe app kept formalities tidy—digital documents, timed arrival, and I was stepping aboard before my coffee could cool. Disembarkation mirrored the same orderliness: tagged luggage, clear directions, and no scramble.\n\n## The Real Talk\nPeak hours meant the pool deck brimmed with life, so I drifted to quieter spaces to read. Ship Wi-Fi was fine for messages; I saved heavier uploads for port cafés. None of it dented the glow—it simply nudged me toward being present.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nI don’t use a mobility aid, but I pay attention: elevators near major venues, gentle ramping where needed, and crew who offered assistance respectfully, never insistently. One afternoon I watched a teen hold a door for a gentleman using a walker—no fanfare, just kindness. That’s the kind of access that shows in a ship’s culture as much as its design.\n- Elevator access to all public decks\n- Pool/whirlpool lifts\n- Accessible staterooms with roll-in showers\n- Priority tendering where applicable\n\n## A Female Perspective\nI felt safe and respected moving around the ship at all hours—crew visible, lighting thoughtful, hallways populated. *Bring a light scarf* for the theater’s cool air. I dressed up for formal night; plenty dressed down, and no one blinked. Spa time was a gift to myself—a facial that left me glowing. Most of all, I made easy conversation with women at adjacent tables; by midweek we were comparing show notes like friends.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nAdventure gave me big thrills at a human scale—music that stayed in my head, sunrises I caught simply because I could, and space to be my own best company. If you’re considering a solo sailing, claim it.\n\n*Book your solo Adventure of the Seas* (affiliate) | *See everything I actually packed* (affiliate)\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",

We spent a week on Adventure of the Seas last summer, and it felt like a win: one part ride-the-slides, one part slow-down-and-talk.\n\n**Family Fare Watch:** Our numbers landed around **~$899 pp** for an Inside; we priced Balcony near **~$1,199 pp** but saved the cash for experiences.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrom the terminal to the gangway, porters made luggage easy so I could keep a hand on my kid and an eye on the app. Onboard, our stateroom attendant turned towel creatures into nightly legend status. Staff never treated me like “a dad who must be lost”—they pointed me toward kids’ club registration and high-fived my son after his first brave run on the Perfect Storm slides.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nWe split our nights between the ice show (jaw-drops), the theater’s big vocals, and a circuit of live music. Early evening pub sets were tame and friendly; later, I traded tips with other parents on best seats for short attention spans. The arcade pulled us in for a father-son rematch that he won by a mile.\n\n## Dining\nWe made a deal: Main Dining Room together most nights (hello, lava cake), one splurge at Giovanni’s where pasta was the only quiet at our table, and a standing date with Café Promenade pizza after late shows. Breakfast became a mission—he swore the buffet pancakes tasted better at sea.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nThe app kept us moving. Boarding windows, digital documents, and we were inside, sizing up slides before lunch. Disembarkation felt equally choreographed—color tags, clear signs, and we were into the pickup lane before the “are we there yet” chorus could start.\n\n## The Real Talk\nBusy sea-day pools meant we hunted shade early. Wi-Fi handled messages; I shelved streaming for later. None of it was deal-breaking—we adjusted and kept the fun rolling.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nWe traveled without mobility needs, but I noted elevators well-placed, helpful signage, and crew offering assistance the right way—with respect. My son quietly held a door for a gentleman using a cane; the nod he got back was all the lesson he needed.\n\n## A Female Perspective\nI asked a mom we befriended for her take. She felt comfortable and safe walking the ship at night, packed a light cardigan for shows, and loved that formal night included everything from tuxes to sundresses—no pressure, just fun. Her spa hour became her recharge.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nOur week was simple on purpose: slides, shows, pizza, bedtime stories we actually finished. Adventure made it easy to be present, and that’s the souvenir I wanted him to take home.\n\n*Book your Adventure of the Seas* (affiliate) | *Peek our real packing* (affiliate)\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",

      "markdown": "## Disclosure\nAhoy—some links are affiliate; booking through them keeps our trip notes free for other travelers.\n\n## Intro\nWe’re four friends from way back—two teachers, a nurse, and Liam, our resident pun-master who rolls instead of walks. We picked Adventure of the Seas for a week because we wanted music, easy meals, and zero coordination drama. Mission accomplished.\n\n**Family Fare Watch:** Our mix-and-match cabins came in around **~$1,049 pp** for Balcony and **~$899 pp** for Interior at the time we booked.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrom day one, staff talked to Liam, not around him. Doors held with a smile, ramps pointed out without lecture. Our stateroom team kept the accessible bathroom dialed in just right. At Boleros, a server slid a table a few inches so Liam could roll in comfortably—tiny adjustment, big welcome.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nWe split nights: Studio B for the ice show, the theater for the big production, and then pub trivia where we pretended we didn’t care but absolutely cared. Late-night, we followed the sax to wherever the band had the room dancing. Some nights ended on the open deck with movie-night stars overhead.\n\n## Dining\nWe leaned into variety: Main Dining Room most nights (shrimp cocktail starter forever), one celebratory steak round at Chops, and roving Café Promenade snack raids. Staff handled preferences without slowing service. On sea days we did the buffet for convenience—and when carrying a tray wasn’t practical, crew simply helped without fuss.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nThe app wrangled our different arrival times, and we all met at the Promenade under the lights like a movie reunion. Departure was just as tidy—tags on, bags out, coffees in hand.\n\n## The Real Talk\nSea-day loungers filled quickly; we learned to scout shade early or embrace roaming. Wi-Fi handled messages; streaming waited until home. Easy trade-offs.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nThe layout worked: elevators close to venues, pool/whirlpool lifts, and accessible staterooms that didn’t feel like afterthoughts. Staff offered help with ramps and doors but let Liam set the pace. That dignity matters.\n\n## A Female Perspective\nFrom our nurse: She felt safe and comfortable walking back to the cabin after late music sets; packed a light wrap for chilly venues; liked that formal night welcomed everything from cocktail dresses to sundresses; and booked a quick mani between ports. Zero pressure, plenty of options.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nWe wanted a week where the hardest choice was which show and which dessert. We got that—and a reminder that good design plus good people equals good travel.\n\n*Book your Adventure of the Seas* (affiliate) | *Grab our group packing list* (affiliate)\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",
