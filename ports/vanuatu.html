        <h1>Vanuatu: Where Traditions Live in the Present</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Port Vila doesn't announce itself. The ship glides into a natural harbour surrounded by green hills, and the city unfolds gently along the waterfront — compact, unhurried, quietly confident in what it offers. This is Vanuatu, an 83-island archipelago scattered across the southwest Pacific, where Melanesian culture didn't retreat into museums when the modern world arrived. It's still here, woven into daily life, visible in the markets, audible in three languages (English, French, Bislama), tangible in villages where customs stretching back 3,000 years continue not as performance but as practice.</p>

          <p>Port Vila is walkable from the cruise terminal, which feels like a gift after ports where you need a taxi just to reach the city limits. The compact capital invites exploration on foot — past colonial-era buildings painted in pastels, through Mama's Market where vendors sell local bananas and handwoven baskets, along a waterfront where fishing boats bob beside modern yachts. The cultural blend is everywhere: Melanesian foundations, English and French colonial history, Chinese commerce, all mixing without erasing each other. It's one of the world's most culturally diverse nations, and somehow it works.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Snorkeling down three meters to the world's only underwater post office at Hideaway Island, waterproof postcard in hand. The postal worker (in full scuba gear) stamped my card with official Vanuatu postage while fish drifted past, utterly indifferent to human bureaucracy. I mailed it to my mother. She received it two weeks later, slightly wrinkled but genuinely postmarked from the ocean floor. Some travel experiences you can't make up.
          </div>

          <p>The waterfalls are real, the Blue Lagoon earns its name, and the cultural villages aren't theme parks — they're living communities sharing what matters to them. Vanuatu moves at its own pace, unbothered by tourism's rush. If you arrive expecting slick infrastructure and polished presentations, recalibrate. What you get instead is authenticity, warmth, and a profound sense that this place knows exactly who it is.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Vanuatu Cultural Centre</h4>
          <p>Premier collection of Pacific artifacts and indigenous heritage materials. Traditional sculptures, ceremonial objects, historical photographs documenting ni-Vanuatu culture. National museum quality. Located in Port Vila, easily walkable from port. Free entry (donations welcome). Air-conditioned sanctuary on hot days. Allow 1-2 hours. Context for everything else you'll see in Vanuatu.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ekasup Cultural Village</h4>
          <p>Living demonstration of 3,000 years of Melanesian tradition. Community members share traditional tatau (tattooing), pandanus weaving, fire-making, kastom dance, and daily life practices. Not a staged show — actual cultural transmission. 15 minutes from port by taxi. Entry ~2,000 VUV ($17 USD). Photography respectful and permitted. Half-day including roundtrip. Powerful connection to authentic Pacific culture.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mele Cascades</h4>
          <p>Series of waterfalls hidden in rainforest just outside Port Vila. 15-20 minute uphill hike on good trail, rewarded by natural pools and cascading water. Swimming permitted and encouraged. Entry ~1,200 VUV (~$10 USD). Bring swimsuit, water shoes, towel. Taxi from port 10-15 minutes. Half-day excursion. The forest is lush, water refreshing, setting genuine. Go early to avoid crowds.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hideaway Island & Underwater Post Office</h4>
          <p>The world's only underwater post office, 3 meters below the surface. Snorkel down with waterproof postcard, get it stamped by scuba-equipped postal worker, mail to anywhere. Brilliant snorkeling over coral gardens even without the postal novelty. Resort day pass includes beach access, snorkel gear, facilities. 30 minutes from port. ~3,500 VUV ($30) day pass. Postcards sold on-site. Half-day minimum. Gloriously absurd and genuinely fun.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Blue Lagoon</h4>
          <p>Natural freshwater pool fed by underground springs — impossibly clear, brilliant blue, surrounded by tropical vegetation. Rope swings, snorkeling, swimming, complete tranquility. 45 minutes from Port Vila by road. Entry ~1,000 VUV ($8-9). Bring snorkel gear (or rent on-site), swimwear, sunscreen. Full-day recommended but half-day possible. The color is real, not photo editing. Worth the drive.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mama's Market</h4>
          <p>Local market in Port Vila selling produce, handicrafts, woven baskets, carvings, fresh fruit. Cultural hub more than tourist attraction. Vendors friendly but no hard sell — haggling not cultural norm. Try local bananas (dozens of varieties), buy handwoven bags, observe daily Vanuatu life. Walking distance from port. Free browsing. 1-2 hours. Go with curiosity, not just shopping agenda.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Port Vila downtown compact and entirely walkable from cruise terminal (5-10 min). Sidewalks decent in town center.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port; negotiate fare before departure. No meters — agree on price first. Expect 500-1,000 VUV for local trips.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Most attractions (Mele Cascades, Blue Lagoon, Hideaway Island) best reached via taxi tour. Book through ship or negotiate at port.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but roads variable quality, signage limited, driving right side. Taxis usually better value and less stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Minibuses serve local routes cheaply but infrequent and confusing for cruise visitors. Stick with taxis for time-limited port days.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lap Lap:</strong> National dish — grated yam, taro, or banana mixed with coconut cream, wrapped in banana leaves, cooked in earthen oven. Dense, filling, distinctly Pacific. Try at markets or cultural villages.</li>
            <li><strong>Taro Root Pancakes:</strong> Savory pancakes made from grated taro root, sometimes mixed with coconut. Street food staple. Hearty breakfast or snack.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanuatu French Fries:</strong> Not potatoes — deep-fried coconut flakes, crispy and sweet. Addictive snack food unique to Vanuatu. Try at markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Tropical Fruit:</strong> Dozens of banana varieties, papaya, passion fruit, pineapple, coconut. Mama's Market offers sampling and purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Island-Caught Seafood:</strong> Tuna, mahi-mahi, wahoo grilled simply with lime and local spices. Waterfront restaurants specialize.</li>
            <li><strong>Kava:</strong> Traditional mildly narcotic drink from pepper plant roots. Ceremonial and social beverage. Effects mild (numbness, relaxation). Nakamals (kava bars) everywhere. Cultural experience but acquired taste.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Vanuatu has no tipping culture and haggling not customary — prices stated are prices expected. Refreshing change from bargaining fatigue.</li>
            <li>Bring cash (Vatu or Australian Dollars) — credit cards accepted at resorts but many attractions and markets cash-only. ATMs in Port Vila.</li>
            <li>December 2024 earthquake damaged some infrastructure — check current status of attractions (especially Blue Lagoon, Mele Cascades) before visit.</li>
            <li>Waterproof postcards at Hideaway Island underwater post office make unique souvenirs — actually arrive postmarked from the ocean floor.</li>
            <li>Ekasup Cultural Village photography permitted but ask permission before photographing individuals. Respectful interaction welcomed.</li>
            <li>Dress modestly outside beach/resort areas — shoulders and knees covered appreciated, especially in villages and cultural sites.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen and insect repellent essential — tropical sun intense, rainforest mosquitoes persistent. Bring reef-safe sunscreen for snorkeling.</li>
            <li>Water shoes useful for Mele Cascades hike and Blue Lagoon rocky entry — smooth stones can be slippery.</li>
          </ul>
