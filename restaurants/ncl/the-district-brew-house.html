      <h3>The District Brew House Review: Craft Beer Done Right at Sea</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The District Brew House is NCL's craft beer and cocktail bar, found on Breakaway, Getaway, Escape, and other ships. It features an extensive draft beer selection — 24+ taps on some ships — with genuine craft options alongside mainstream brands. It also serves a full cocktail menu and a limited food menu. Drinks are standard pricing or covered by the beverage package. It's the beer lover's destination on the ship.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The 24+ tap handles are the draw. Craft options include rotating IPAs, stouts, pale ales, wheat beers, and seasonal selections that change by region and sailing. The Craft Beer Flight (4-5 tasters, $12-15) is the best way to explore what's on tap. Beyond the craft selection, mainstream taps (Bud, Coors, Heineken) are available for less adventurous drinkers. The cocktail menu is more extensive than most NCL bars — they make a proper Whiskey Sour, Moscow Mule, and Old Fashioned. A limited food menu (sliders, flatbreads, bar snacks) pairs well with the beer. Drink package holders can access all standard taps; some premium craft pours may carry small upcharges.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Bartenders know their beer — they can discuss hop profiles, recommend based on your preferences, and pour proper pints with the right head. The Craft Beer Flight comes with brief tasting notes. Service is friendly and knowledgeable, a step above the generic bar experience. During prime evening hours, the bar gets busy and service slows. The bartenders are patient with less experienced beer drinkers, which is welcoming.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Industrial-chic brewpub: exposed ductwork, reclaimed wood, blackboard tap lists, copper brewing accents, and a long bar backed by gleaming tap handles. It's the most authentic pub atmosphere on any NCL ship. TVs show sports — American football, soccer, basketball — making it the de facto sports bar. The seating mixes bar stools, high-tops, and lounge areas. The crowd is beer enthusiasts, sports fans, and anyone who prefers a pub over a cocktail lounge. Music is low, conversation is easy, and the vibe is "your favorite neighborhood bar, at sea." During evening hours it fills up but stays manageable. Trivia nights and beer-tasting events add scheduled programming.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.9/5.</strong> The District Brew House is the best beer bar on any NCL ship — the craft tap selection, knowledgeable bartenders, and pub atmosphere are genuine highlights. It loses points for the mainstream taps taking up space, the limited food menu, and taps running dry on long sailings. <em>Tip:</em> Order the Craft Beer Flight first to discover what's on tap, then commit to a pint of your favorite. Ask the bartender what's freshest — some taps sit longer than others. Go during afternoon sports for a quiet, authentic pub experience.</p>
