      <h1>Glacier Bay: My Best Day at Sea</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>This isn't a port — it's the best day of the entire cruise. We entered Glacier Bay National Park at 6 a.m., slipping into a 3.3-million-acre UNESCO World Heritage Site (that's roughly 5,156 square miles, or about 2.5 million football fields, or the size of Connecticut, or the amount of wilderness it would take to make you forget every worry you've ever had) that shelters more than a thousand glaciers across pristine wilderness accessible only by boat or plane. This remote sanctuary was first protected as a National Monument on February 26, 1925 by President Coolidge, expanded by President Roosevelt on April 18, 1939 into what was then the largest park unit in the entire system, and finally elevated to National Park status on December 2, 1980 by President Carter. National Park Service rangers and a Tlingit cultural interpreter boarded at the mouth and narrated all day over the PA and on the bow, helping us spot wildlife and sharing stories as we cruised into waters where only two cruise ships are permitted each day — a limit of just 153 vessels during the entire June-to-August peak season. The ship slowed to a crawl through whale zones where humpbacks were already surfacing, the captain observing strict speed restrictions to protect the animals that migrate here each summer to feed in what's considered one of Alaska's finest whale-watching grounds.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/glacier-bay/glacier-bay-1.webp" alt="Glacier Bay harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Glacier Bay — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Glacier%20Bay&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>We watched humpback whales — magnificent creatures that can grow to 60 feet and weigh 80,000 pounds, living 45 to 90 years — performing coordinated bubble-net feeding where they spiraled beneath schools of herring and exhaled curtains of bubbles to trap fish before lunging through the surface with mouths agape. Then breaching displays sent forty-ton bodies skyward in explosions of white water. The rangers told us that John Muir himself, at age 41 in the summer of 1879, paddled these same waters in a canoe with Tlingit guides who knew the land and ice intimately. Muir came seeking to understand how glaciers carved valleys — insights that would help him prove Yosemite Valley's glacial origins. The rangers pointed out orcas hunting in pods, Steller sea lions hauled out on rocky points, harbor porpoises racing alongside, and sea otters floating on their backs cracking mussels. Along the forested shores we spotted brown and black bears digging clams at low tide, mountain goats perched impossibly on sheer cliffs, and even glimpses of wolves and moose moving through spruce groves. Overhead, bald eagles patrolled from snags — part of more than 200 bird species that nest and feed in the park.</p>

        <p>The ship slowly cruised up to Margerie Glacier — the park's most famous and active glacial face, a 21-mile river of ice (that's roughly 110,880 feet, or about 2,100 humpback whales laid nose-to-tail, or the length of 21,000 salmon lined up, or the distance a determined otter could float if it had three days and excellent motivation) that terminates in a mile-wide wall of electric blue rising 250 feet above water (roughly 50 average adults stacked head-to-toe, or about 1,250 king salmon tall, or 250 very tall park rangers standing on each other's shoulders, or the height that makes you realize how small humans really are) and plunging another 100 feet below. The captain spun us 360 degrees so every balcony got the view. We watched house-sized chunks calve with cracks like lightning and booms like artillery, the rumble echoing across the water for seconds. Harbor seals with pups nursed on ice floes that drifted past the bow. Then on to Lamplugh Glacier glowing turquoise in the midday sun — just two of the fifteen active tidewater glaciers that pour from the mountains into the bay. Lunch was on our balcony with room service while drifting in John Hopkins Inlet, glaciers on three sides, absolute silence except for cracking ice and raven calls. The Tlingit interpreter shared the remarkable story of this landscape's transformation: in 1750, at the peak of the Little Ice Age, the entire bay was choked with a single massive glacier over 4,000 feet thick in places and 20 miles wide. When Captain George Vancouver surveyed this coast in 1794, he charted only a slight indentation in the shoreline. But by the time John Muir arrived in 1879, the ice had already retreated 45 miles up the fjord. By 1916, the Grand Pacific Glacier had melted back another 60 miles. The famous Muir Glacier — named in honor of the naturalist and once a towering 300-foot wall of ice calving directly into the sea — has itself receded so far that by the 1990s it no longer even reaches tidewater. This is the fastest glacial retreat documented anywhere on Earth, a living laboratory of climate and geological change unfolding before our eyes.</p>

        <p>The pros: the most spectacular scenery imaginable with world-class ranger commentary throughout the day.</p>
        <p>The cons: weather can close in, though even rainy days are dramatic.</p>

          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Engine cut, total silence except for the glacier growling for ten straight minutes, then a section the size of a city block let go with a roar that shook the entire ship while everyone on deck gasped as one.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Glacier Bay is the crown jewel of every Alaska cruise — 65 miles of fjord with 16 tidewater glaciers, mountains rising straight from the sea, and park rangers who board to narrate the entire day.
