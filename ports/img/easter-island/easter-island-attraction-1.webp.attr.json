  "description": "Melin Wynt Llynnon Llanddeusant Llynnon Windmill. The only fully restored windmill out of more than fifty which once dotted the landscape of the island. Since early times Anglesey was known as \"Mam Cymru\" (mother of Wales) and supplied much of the north's grain.\n<p>Llynnon Mill was built in 1775 at a cost of \u00a3550, and operated until 1918 when it was damaged by a storm. In 1976 the ruin (see <a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Llynnon_Mill_(pre_restoration).jpg\" title=\"File:Llynnon Mill (pre restoration).jpg\">96219</a>) was acquired by the council and restored as a tourist attraction and working productive mill.\nHere it is two days before Easter and the mill is being prepared for reopening after its winter closure. The main job is the sheeting of the sails by the miller and his two new apprentice millers.\n</p>\nFor more information on the mill see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.angleseyheritage.org/doc.asp?cat=1034\">http://www.angleseyheritage.org/doc.asp?cat=1034</a>",
