        <h1>Bodrum: Where Ancient Wonders Meet Medieval Knights</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Bodrum doesn't just sit on the Aegean coast — it cascades down to it. Whitewashed houses tumble down hillsides like sugar cubes spilled from a bowl, bougainvillea explodes in purple riots against every wall, and the whole town seems to lean affectionately toward water so blue it looks photoshopped. But what makes Bodrum extraordinary isn't just the postcard scenery — it's the layers of history stacked like archaeological sediment beneath your feet.</p>

          <p>This was Halicarnassus, home to one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The Mausoleum that gave us the word "mausoleum" stood here, a tomb so magnificent that ancient travelers crossed empires to witness it. What remains today are foundation stones and fragments — the rest was cannibalized by medieval knights to build the castle that now dominates the harbor. History eating itself to build something new. There's a metaphor there about continuity and change, but mostly I'm just impressed by the audacity of dismantling a Wonder of the World for building materials.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in the English Tower of Bodrum Castle, looking at medieval graffiti carved by Knights Hospitaller in 1509. Their names, their coats of arms, their dates — scratched into stone by men who'd sailed from Rhodes to defend this harbor against Ottoman expansion. Five hundred years later, I traced the letters with my finger. Someone carved "I was here" in stone, and here I was, reading it. The past isn't past when you can touch it.
          </div>

          <p>The castle is the crown jewel — officially the Castle of St. Peter, built by the Knights of St. John between 1402 and 1437. It's one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the Mediterranean, and it houses an extraordinary Museum of Underwater Archaeology filled with amphorae, shipwrecks, and treasures pulled from the Aegean depths. You could spend hours in these halls, listening to stories told by pottery shards and corroded bronze. The knights built well. Their fortress still guards the harbor, though now it guards against forgetting rather than invasion.</p>

          <p>But Bodrum isn't just ancient stones and medieval towers. Walk along the marina and you'll see million-dollar yachts bobbing beside traditional wooden gulets, the double-ended sailing vessels that have plied these waters since before anyone thought to call it the Aegean. The waterfront promenade stretches from the castle to the modern cruise terminal — a pleasant 20-minute walk past cafes, boutiques, and locals who seem genuinely pleased you've come to visit. The beaches beckon too: Gumbet for lively beach clubs, Bitez for windsurfing and calm family waters, Ortakent for long stretches of sand that feel miles from anywhere.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Bodrum Castle (Castle of St. Peter)</h4>
          <p>Magnificent 15th-century fortress built by Knights Hospitaller — one of the Mediterranean's best-preserved medieval castles. Houses Museum of Underwater Archaeology with ancient shipwrecks, Bronze Age treasures, and amphora collections. English, French, Italian, German, and Snake towers each tell different stories. Entry ~€20-25 with audio guide. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. The views from the ramparts over Bodrum's twin bays are worth the climb alone.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</h4>
          <p>Ruins of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built 353-350 BC as tomb for Mausolus, Persian satrap. Original structure stood 45 meters tall — destroyed by earthquakes, stones used to build Bodrum Castle. Today: foundation platform, scattered columns, underground chamber, small museum with sculptural fragments. Entry ~€10-15. Visit takes 1 hour. Powerful to stand where a Wonder once stood, even if imagination must do the heavy lifting.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ancient Theatre of Halicarnassus</h4>
          <p>Hellenistic amphitheater carved into hillside (4th century BC), still used for concerts. Seating for 13,000. Stunning views over Bodrum and harbor. Free entry. Climb for photos and atmosphere. 15-minute walk uphill from town center. Sunset here is magical — the Aegean turns gold and the whole peninsula glows.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Milta Bodrum Marina</h4>
          <p>Luxury yacht marina — superyachts, traditional gulets, waterfront dining. Window-shop million-dollar vessels, watch sailors prep for Blue Voyage cruises, eat fresh seafood at harborside restaurants. Free to stroll. Half-hour minimum, longer if you're dining. The marina captures modern Bodrum — where ancient heritage meets contemporary luxury.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Beaches</h4>
          <p><strong>Gumbet Beach</strong> (3 km west): Lively beach with clubs, water sports, family-friendly. Taxi 10 min. <strong>Bitez Beach</strong> (7 km west): Relaxed vibe, shallow waters, windsurfing, tangerine groves behind beach. <strong>Ortakent Beach</strong> (15 km west): Long sandy stretch, quieter, great for swimming. Beach clubs rent umbrellas/loungers (~€10-15). Bring reef-safe sunscreen.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Bodrum Market</h4>
          <p>Weekly markets rotate: Friday farmer's market (produce, olives, cheese, honey), Tuesday bazaar (handicrafts, pottery, textiles, leather). Atmospheric, authentic, excellent for souvenirs and snacks. Cash preferred. Bargaining expected and enjoyed. Famous Bodrum Sandals (genuine leather, Aegean-inspired designs) make excellent gifts.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> City center highly walkable; waterfront promenade from terminal to castle is scenic and easy (20 min). Hilly terrain inland but manageable.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Plentiful at terminal and around town. Meters required but negotiate first for longer trips. Bodrum center to Gumbet Beach ~€5-7. Honest drivers but agree on fare before departure.</li>
            <li><strong>Dolmuş (Minibus):</strong> Shared minibuses run fixed routes to beaches and nearby towns. Very cheap (~€1-2) but can be crowded. Depart when full. Great for adventure, less practical on cruise day time limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Car/Scooter Rental:</strong> Available near port; useful for beach hopping or exploring Bodrum Peninsula. Scooters ~€20/day, cars ~€30-50/day. International license required. Traffic manageable outside town center.</li>
            <li><strong>Boat Tours:</strong> Day trips to Greek islands (Kos), nearby bays, swimming coves. Book from marina or port. Popular but verify return time aligns with ship departure.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Izgara Ahtapot (Grilled Octopus):</strong> Aegean specialty — tender octopus chargrilled with olive oil, lemon, herbs. Bodrum's signature dish. Every waterfront restaurant serves it; quality varies but rarely disappoints.</li>
            <li><strong>Mezze Platters:</strong> Shared starters — hummus, baba ghanoush, ezme (spicy tomato-pepper dip), haydari (yogurt-herb dip), stuffed grape leaves, feta. Order several, share generously, live slowly.</li>
            <li><strong>Kebabs:</strong> Adana (spicy minced lamb), şiş (marinated cubes), köfte (meatballs). Served with rice, grilled vegetables, bread. Ubiquitous and universally satisfying.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Sea bass, bream, red mullet — choose your fish at display, they'll grill it. Priced by weight. Expensive but impeccably fresh. The Aegean on a plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Gözleme:</strong> Traditional flatbread stuffed with cheese, spinach, or minced meat, cooked on griddle. Street food perfection. ~€3-5. Eat hot.</li>
            <li><strong>Turkish Tea &amp; Coffee:</strong> Çay (black tea in tulip glasses) served everywhere, constantly, ritually. Turkish coffee thick, strong, fortune-telling grounds at bottom. Both cultural essentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Rakı:</strong> Anise-flavored spirit (Turkey's national drink). Mix with water (turns milky white — "lion's milk"). Pairs with mezze. Potent and festive.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The walk from cruise terminal to Bodrum Castle is beautiful — waterfront promenade, boat views, cafes. Save taxi fare and enjoy the stroll.</li>
            <li>Bodrum Castle opens early (8:30 AM). Arrive when it opens to avoid crowds and heat. Afternoon sun makes ramparts uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li>Mausoleum site requires imagination — not much survives. Combine with Ancient Theatre for fuller ancient Halicarnassus experience.</li>
            <li>Friday farmer's market and Tuesday handicraft bazaar are authentic local experiences. Markets run morning to early afternoon. Cash essential, bargaining expected.</li>
            <li>Bodrum Sandals (leather sandals) are genuine local craft, not tourist kitsch. Quality varies — check stitching and leather softness before buying.</li>
            <li>Turkish Lira fluctuates. Check exchange rate day-of. ATMs give best rates. Currency exchange kiosks near tourist sites charge premium. Credit cards widely accepted.</li>
            <li>Aegean sun is strong even in shoulder seasons. Sunscreen, hat, sunglasses non-negotiable. Drink water constantly. Heat sneaks up on you.</li>
            <li>Restaurants on castle-view waterfront charge premium for location. Side streets one block inland offer same food, lower prices, local atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Blue Voyage gulet cruises (multi-day yacht trips) are famous here — Bodrum is the heart of gulet culture. If you see beautiful wooden sailing vessels, that's why.</li>
          </ul>
