      <h3>SeaPlex Review: The Venue That Defines Quantum Class</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> I'd read about SeaPlex but didn't quite believe it until I was driving a bumper car while sailing through the Atlantic. It's the kind of thing that makes you laugh at the absurdity — and then immediately get back in line for another session.</p>

      <h4>Bumper Cars</h4>
      <p>The star attraction. Sessions run about 10 minutes with ~15 cars on the floor. The cars are electric and surprisingly zippy. My competitive family turned it into an all-out war — my daughter targeted me specifically for the entire session. Worth noting: there's often a line, so check the schedule and arrive a few minutes early.</p>

      <h4>Roller Skating</h4>
      <p>The afternoon skating session transported me back to childhood birthday parties. They dim the lights, crank up the disco music, and suddenly you're in a floating roller rink. Skates are provided and fit well. My wife hadn't skated in 20 years but was doing laps by the end of the session.</p>

      <h4>Circus School</h4>
      <p>My kids signed up for trapeze lessons and I watched nervously from below. The instructors were patient and safety-focused. Seeing my 12-year-old swing through the air, catching the bar on her first try, was a cruise highlight. There's also juggling and other ground-based activities for the less adventurous.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5.</strong> SeaPlex justifies the Quantum Class experience. The variety of activities means there's something for everyone, and everything being complimentary makes it easy to try things spontaneously. Pro tip: check the schedule on embarkation day and plan around the activities you most want to do.</p>
