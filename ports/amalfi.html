          <h2>My Logbook: Where the Sea Remembers Empire</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've been researching the Amalfi Coast with growing excitement, yet nothing in my planning quite prepares me for what I keep reading about this coastline. My research shows ships anchoring in the Gulf of Salerno to tender passengers ashore to what was once a maritime republic so powerful that some accounts credit it with inventing the magnetic compass. I want to understand how a jewel-box village tucked into cliffs once rivaled Venice and Genoa for Mediterranean dominance.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/amalfi/amalfi-duomo.webp" alt="The Duomo di Sant'Andrea cathedral in Amalfi with its distinctive Arab-Norman facade and 62 steps leading to the ornate entrance" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Duomo di Sant'Andrea — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What draws me to Amalfi is the remarkable transformation the tender ride represents. By the time passengers reach Amalfi's harbor, the modern world has fallen away, replaced by pastel façades stacked like a child's building blocks against impossible slopes, and terraces of lemon trees glowing like scattered gold coins on every hillside. The air reportedly tastes of salt and citrus — that particular Amalfi sweetness travelers describe but can never quite capture in words.</p>

            <p>The Duomo di Sant'Andrea has captured my imagination completely. This isn't some quaint village church — this is a 9th-century monument to power and faith, dressed in a neo-Byzantine façade that glitters in the Mediterranean sun. However, the Arab-Sicilian architecture whispers of Amalfi's trading networks that once stretched from North Africa to Constantinople. I keep reading about the bronze doors that actually came from Constantinople itself — imagine the journey they made, by ship, across the sea, carried as treasure to this cliffside cathedral.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/amalfi/cloister-paradise.webp" alt="The Cloister of Paradise in Amalfi with Arab-influenced arches framing a tranquil garden courtyard filled with palm trees" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Cloister of Paradise — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Yet the true sanctuary that calls to me is the Cloister of Paradise — Chiostro del Paradiso. It reportedly lives up to its name. Arab-influenced arches frame a garden courtyard where light falls in patterns that shift through the day like prayers. I imagine sitting on a stone bench among ancient columns and palm fronds, listening to fountain water and footsteps echo softly on marble. Medieval monks chose this particular word — Paradise — and travelers still understand why centuries later.</p>

            <p>My planning has revealed two treasures you can take home in your suitcase and your memory. The first is limoncello — that sunshine-in-a-bottle liqueur made from the sfusato lemons that grow on these terraces like gifts from the gods. Every shop offers tastings. The second is handmade paper, called bambagina, produced here since the Middle Ages using traditional methods in the Valle dei Mulini. I'm already planning to buy a cream-colored journal with deckled edges.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>What I'm Most Looking Forward To:</strong> Finding a stone bench in the Cloister of Paradise, fountain water echoing softly off Arab arches, sunlight falling in patterns on ancient stone — and realizing this place has offered the same peace to travelers for more than a thousand years. The Amalfi Coast represents something rare: beauty so concentrated it almost hurts, preserved across centuries.
            </div>

            <p>The Path of the Gods has been dominating my research. Linking Amalfi to Positano via a high mountain trail, the Sentiero degli Dei delivers on its mythological name. It's challenging, by all accounts, but walking that ancient path with the entire Amalfi Coast unfurling below like a painted scroll sounds transformative. The sea shimmers turquoise through breaks in the cliffs. Travelers describe feeling suspended between heaven and earth.</p>

            <p>Though my primary focus is the coastal villages, the Emerald Grotto keeps appearing in my planning. About five kilometers west, tucked into the cliffs of Conca dei Marini, lies the Grotta dello Smeraldo — a cave where sunlight filters through an underwater opening and turns the seawater an otherworldly jade-green. You descend by elevator or stairs, then take a rowboat through chambers where stalactites glow like underwater cathedrals. Strange and beautiful and nothing like anywhere else.</p>

            <p>The food possibilities have captured my imagination completely. I keep reading about spaghetti alle vongole at cliffside terraces while sailboats drift below like white petals on blue silk — briny, garlicky pasta finished with good olive oil. Falanghina wine, local white, paired with fresh peaches. Simple food made with care in places so beautiful they almost hurt.</p>

            <p>My research has convinced me that the Amalfi Coast offers something irreplaceable — villages that have been capturing travelers' hearts since Roman emperors sought refuge here, architecture that blends Arab and Norman and Italian traditions, limoncello made from lemons that grow nowhere else quite the same way, and views that have inspired poets and painters for centuries. I'm going with respect for the medieval maritime republic that built this beauty, excitement for those 62 cathedral steps, and appreciation for a coastline that has been called the most beautiful in Europe.</p>

            <p>I've been researching the practical side too — ferry tickets run €15-25 from Salerno to Amalfi, about 50 minutes of coastal scenery. The Cloister of Paradise charges just €3 for admission. A proper cliffside lunch with pasta and local wine runs €25-40 per person, more in Positano where everything costs a premium. Even limoncello tastings are mostly free, with bottles to take home costing €12-25 depending on quality. The expenses add up but feel proportional to the experience — this isn't a budget destination, but the memories justify every euro spent.</p>

        <!-- CRUISE PORT SECTION - 100+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Ships anchor in the Gulf of Salerno and tender passengers ashore — a 15-20 minute tender ride to the Salerno waterfront. From there, ferries and buses connect to Amalfi, Positano, Ravello, and other coastal villages. This is a tender port, so budget extra time for tender operations, especially on busy days.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">
            <img src="/ports/img/amalfi/salerno-harbor.webp" alt="Salerno harbor with tender boats bringing cruise passengers ashore with the Amalfi Coast mountains rising in the background" loading="lazy"/>
            <figcaption>Salerno harbor — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Currency is Euro. Credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops, though smaller vendors and ticket booths prefer cash. Italian is the language though English is widely spoken in tourist areas. The Salerno waterfront is wheelchair accessible with flat pathways. However, the coastal villages feature steep stairs and uneven cobblestones that present challenges for mobility-impaired visitors — Amalfi town involves 62 steps to reach the cathedral, and Positano is essentially built vertically.</p>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION - 200+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Coastal Ferries:</strong> The best way to experience the coast. Travelmar and Alilauro run regular routes from Salerno to Amalfi (50 minutes), Positano, and Minori. See the coastline from the sea as sailors have for centuries. Ferries run frequently in good weather (15-25 per person one way). Check schedules the night before.</li>
            <li><strong>SITA Buses:</strong> Connect coastal towns along the famous SS163 Amalfi Drive. Yes, the road is narrow and winding with hairpin turns, but drivers are professionals and views are spectacular. Buy tickets at tabacchi (tobacco shops) before boarding. Approximately 3-5 per ride.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Drivers:</strong> Widely available for flexibility and commentary. Expect 150-300 for half-day coastal tours. Worth it if short on time or anxious about navigating public transport. Ship excursion desk can arrange.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking in Salerno:</strong> The town center is a pleasant 10-15 minute walk from the tender pier. Flat and accessible. Good for coffee and browsing before heading to the coast.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking in Villages:</strong> Essential for exploring but challenging. Amalfi has 62 cathedral steps. Positano is built vertically with hundreds of steps. Ravello involves bus ride up mountain then walking. Comfortable shoes mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Emerald Grotto Access:</strong> Ferry to Conca dei Marini or bus along coast. Elevator or stairs descend to cave level. Rowboat tour through the grotto included in admission (approximately 6).</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section" id="beaches">
          <h2>Beaches &amp; Shorelines</h2>
          <p>The Amalfi Coast features small beach areas tucked between cliffs — the dramatic scenery is the attraction rather than expansive sand beaches:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Amalfi Beach (Marina Grande):</strong> Small pebble and sand beach right in Amalfi town, steps from the main piazza. Beach clubs rent chairs and umbrellas (20-40/day). Dramatic cliffs frame the view.</li>
            <li><strong>Positano Beaches:</strong> Spiaggia Grande is the main beach with restaurants and beach clubs. Fornillo Beach is quieter, reached by a coastal path. Pebble beaches with crystal-clear water. Beach clubs 25-50/day for chairs and umbrella.</li>
            <li><strong>Atrani Beach:</strong> Tiny fishing village beach just around the point from Amalfi (5-minute walk). Less touristy, authentic atmosphere. Free public beach area.</li>
            <li><strong>Maiori Beach:</strong> Longest beach on the Amalfi Coast — nearly 1km of sandy shore. More accessible for families. Reachable by bus or ferry from Amalfi.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tip: Water shoes recommended — most beaches are pebble or rocky rather than fine sand. Water is crystal clear and swimmable May through October.</p>

        <!-- EXCURSIONS SECTION - 400+ words with booking guidance -->
        <section class="port-section" id="excursions">
          <h2>Shore Excursions &amp; Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Ferries and buses run regularly and don't require reservations. Ship excursion options offer guaranteed return to ship for the Amalfi Drive. Book in advance for private drivers, Path of the Gods guided hikes, or Emerald Grotto boat tours in peak summer season. Independent travel very doable here.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Amalfi Town &amp; Cathedral</h4>
          <p>The heart of the coast. Climb the 62 steps to the Duomo di Sant'Andrea — a 9th-century cathedral dressed in Arab-Norman-Byzantine splendor. The bronze doors came from Constantinople. Inside, the Cloister of Paradise (Chiostro del Paradiso) offers Arab arches, palm trees, and profound stillness. Cathedral free; Cloister 3. Allow 1-2 hours for cathedral, cloister, and wandering the piazza. No advance booking needed. Ferry from Salerno 50 minutes (15-20).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Positano Village</h4>
          <p>The iconic vertical village — pastel buildings cascading down cliffs to a pebble beach. Boutique shopping, cliffside restaurants, and the most photographed views on the coast. Wear comfortable shoes — Positano is essentially stairs. Ferry from Amalfi 25 minutes (12-15). Allow 2-3 hours for wandering, lunch, and beach time. Independent exploration works well. Ship excursion combines Positano with other villages for guaranteed return to ship.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ravello &amp; Villa Cimbrone</h4>
          <p>The village in the clouds — perched 350 meters above the sea. Villa Cimbrone's Terrace of Infinity offers views Gore Vidal called "the most beautiful in the world." Gardens, medieval architecture, and escape from the coastal crowds. Bus from Amalfi (25 minutes, 3-4) or private driver. Allow 2-3 hours. Book ahead for high-end lunch at Belvedere Restaurant. Independent or ship excursion both work well.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Emerald Grotto (Grotta dello Smeraldo)</h4>
          <p>A sea cave where sunlight filters through underwater openings, turning the water an otherworldly jade-green. Descend by elevator or stairs, then rowboat tour through stalactite chambers. 5km west of Amalfi in Conca dei Marini. Admission 6 includes boat tour. Reachable by ferry, bus, or boat tour from Amalfi. Allow 1-1.5 hours including travel. Best in morning light.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Path of the Gods (Sentiero degli Dei)</h4>
          <p>The legendary hiking trail linking Bomerano to Positano along cliff-top paths with views that justify the mythological name. Moderate difficulty, 7km, 3-4 hours one way. Bus to Bomerano trailhead, hike to Positano, ferry back. Proper hiking shoes essential. Bring water. Book ahead for guided hiking tours (40-80 per person) or go independently. Not recommended for those with vertigo — significant cliff exposure.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Limoncello Tastings</h4>
          <p>The Amalfi Coast produces the finest limoncello in Italy from sfusato lemons grown on terraces. Nearly every shop offers free tastings. For deeper experience, visit a limoncello producer — Limonoro or La Valle dei Mulini offer tours and tastings (10-15). Buy bottles to bring home (12-25). The sfusato lemons are larger, sweeter, and more aromatic than standard varieties.</p>

        <!-- FOOD SECTION -->
        <section class="port-section" id="food">
          <h2>Food &amp; Dining</h2>
          <p>Coastal Italian cuisine at its finest — seafood, lemons, and pasta with views:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti alle Vongole ($$):</strong> The signature dish — briny clams, garlic, white wine, parsley, good olive oil. Every cliffside restaurant serves it. 14-18 in Amalfi, 18-25 in Positano.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood ($$$):</strong> Grilled whole fish, fritto misto (mixed fried seafood), seafood risotto. Expect 25-40 for main courses at restaurants with views.</li>
            <li><strong>Sfogliatella ($):</strong> Shell-shaped pastry with ricotta filling — the Amalfi Coast version is exceptional. 3-5 at pastry shops.</li>
            <li><strong>Delizia al Limone ($):</strong> Lemon-soaked sponge cake with lemon cream — the local dessert. 6-10 at restaurants.</li>
            <li><strong>Limoncello ($):</strong> Complimentary digestivo at many restaurants, or 3-5 for a glass. The real thing tastes nothing like mass-produced versions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Budget tip: Lunch is significantly cheaper than dinner at the same restaurants. Aperitivo hour (6-8pm) offers drinks with complimentary snacks at many bars.</p>
          <p>Note: Service charge (coperto) of 2-4 per person is standard. Additional tipping 5-10% for exceptional service.</p>

            <li><strong>Tender Operations:</strong> Ships anchor and tender — allow 30-45 minutes for tender lines on busy days. Leave early to maximize time ashore.</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal Drive:</strong> The SS163 Amalfi Drive features hairpin turns, narrow passages, and sheer drops. If prone to motion sickness, bring Dramamine. Sit on the mountain side of buses if nervous about heights.</li>
            <li><strong>Stairs Everywhere:</strong> All coastal villages involve significant stair climbing. Amalfi has 62 cathedral steps. Positano is built vertically. Supportive walking shoes essential — leave fancy sandals on the ship.</li>
            <li><strong>Crowds:</strong> Peak season (June-August) brings significant crowds. Mornings and late afternoons are less crowded. Visit cathedral and cloister early.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry Schedules:</strong> Check schedules the night before — ferries may be cancelled in rough weather. Have a backup plan using SITA buses.</li>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>The Amalfi Coast is a UNESCO World Heritage Site stretching 50 kilometers along the Sorrentine Peninsula south of Naples. Cruise ships anchor in the Gulf of Salerno and tender passengers to the Salerno waterfront. From there, ferries and buses connect to the famous coastal villages — Amalfi, Positano, Ravello, and others. Currency is Euro; approximately 1 = $1.10 USD. Credit cards are accepted at most establishments, but carry cash for small vendors and bus tickets.</p>

          <p>Safety is excellent — Italy is very safe for tourists. Standard precautions apply in crowded areas. Italians are warm and helpful; basic Italian phrases are appreciated but English is widely spoken in tourist areas.</p>

          <p>Accessibility is challenging on the Amalfi Coast. The Salerno waterfront is flat and accessible, but coastal villages feature steep stairs and cobblestones. Amalfi's cathedral requires climbing 62 steps. Positano is built vertically with hundreds of steps. Wheelchair users and those with mobility limitations will find the terrain extremely difficult. Ravello is accessible by vehicle but the village itself involves walking.</p>

          <p>Weather is Mediterranean — hot and sunny May through October. Bring sunscreen, hats, and water. Light layers for air-conditioned spaces. Rain is rare in summer but possible in spring and fall.</p>

        <section class="port-section" id="faq">
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p><strong>Q: Is the Amalfi Coast worth a port stop?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. This is one of the world's most beautiful coastlines — pastel villages clinging to cliffs, lemon terraces glowing in the sun, water so blue it looks painted. Add medieval cathedral beauty, authentic limoncello, and the legendary Path of the Gods hiking trail, and you have a port day that lives in memory forever.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to see the coast in one day?</strong><br/>A: Take the ferry from Salerno to Amalfi (50 minutes), explore the cathedral and Cloister of Paradise, then ferry to Positano for lunch and wandering. If time allows, bus up to Ravello for Villa Cimbrone. Ferry plus bus combo offers flexibility and views from both sea and land.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is the coastal drive really scary?</strong><br/>A: The SS163 Amalfi Drive features hairpin turns and narrow passages carved into sheer cliffs. Buses pass each other with inches to spare. If nervous about heights, sit on the mountain side (not cliff side) and consider Dramamine. The views are so stunning most people forget to be scared — it's exhilarating more than frightening.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What should I bring home?</strong><br/>A: Limoncello made from local sfusato lemons (the real thing tastes nothing like mass-produced versions), hand-painted Vietri ceramics in brilliant yellows and blues, handmade leather sandals from artisans who've been crafting them for generations, and bambagina paper from the traditional paper mills.</p>

        <p class="answer-line"><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The Amalfi Coast is Italy's most dramatic coastline — tender from Salerno to pastel villages clinging to cliffs. Ferry to Amalfi for the cathedral and Cloister of Paradise, continue to Positano for lunch and views. Ravello for the Terrace of Infinity. Everything involves stairs. Limoncello tastings everywhere. Ship excursion offers guaranteed return; independent travel very doable.</p>
