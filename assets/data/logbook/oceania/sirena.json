      "markdown": "**Sirena joined Oceania in 2016—the most recent addition to the R Class fleet and the freshest of the intimate ships.**\n\nAcquired from P&O Australia (formerly Ocean Princess), Sirena underwent comprehensive conversion to Oceania standards. The ship shares R Class specifications with [Regatta](/ships/oceania/regatta.html), [Insignia](/ships/oceania/insignia.html), and [Nautica](/ships/oceania/nautica.html): 684 guests, same dining venues, same intimate atmosphere.\n\nAs the newest R Class addition, Sirena's refurbishment proved most recent among the sisters. The conversion applied lessons from years of Oceania R Class operations.\n\nThe naming continues Oceania's evocative tradition—Sirena references Italian for 'mermaid,' maintaining the brand's elegant naming philosophy.\n\nFor R Class comparison: Sirena offers the same intimate experience as her sisters with the advantage of most recent acquisition and conversion. The fundamental R Class experience transfers completely.",

      "markdown": "**Sirena's Mediterranean deployments showcase why R Class scale serves this region exceptionally well.**\n\nAt 684 guests, Sirena fits historic Mediterranean ports comfortably. Portofino, Sorrento, small Greek islands—these destinations welcome intimate ships while struggling with mega-ship crowds.\n\nOceania's destination-intensive philosophy matches Mediterranean exploration perfectly. More ports, longer stays, fewer sea days. The itineraries treat the region seriously rather than rushing through highlights.\n\nMediterranean cruising at R Class scale creates different experience than larger-ship alternatives. Port experiences improve with smaller passenger counts. Shore excursions feel less like herding. The ship-to-destination ratio works.\n\nCulinary quality matters when visiting regions defined by food culture. Toscana's Italian, the Grand Dining Room's Mediterranean emphasis—Sirena's cuisine holds its own against shore-side dining.\n\nFor Mediterranean priorities: Sirena offers intimate scale that enhances Mediterranean exploration. The R Class advantage becomes particularly apparent in this region.",

      "markdown": "**Oceania stakes reputation on 'Finest Cuisine at Sea.' Sirena proves that claim at R Class intimate scale.**\n\nThe Grand Dining Room maintains culinary quality regardless of ship size. The menu reflects Jacques Pépin's partnership with Oceania—techniques and standards that pervade the fleet.\n\nSpecialty restaurants included without upcharge: Toscana for Italian, Polo Grill for steakhouse, Red Ginger for Pan-Asian. The variety seems impossible at 684 guests, yet all deliver excellently.\n\nRoom service produces restaurant-quality meals anytime. The culinary commitment extends beyond dining venues to every food encounter aboard.\n\nThe intimate scale means chefs know guests' preferences by voyage end. Dietary requirements receive personal attention rather than systematic handling. Culinary personalization compounds over the cruise.\n\nFor culinary priorities: Sirena proves Oceania's culinary claim scales down as well as up. The intimate vessel delivers the same dining excellence as larger sisters—perhaps with more personal attention.",
