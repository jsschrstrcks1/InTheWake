      "markdown": "**Diamond Princess holds a place in world history. In February 2020, she became the first cruise ship quarantined for COVID-19—the world watching as the pandemic's reality became undeniable.**\n\nThe images became iconic: passengers waving from balconies in Yokohama, crews in protective gear, the ship becoming floating laboratory as scientists studied the virus aboard.\n\nFor passengers and crew, the experience was traumatic. Weeks of uncertainty, illness spreading despite quarantine, global attention on their confinement. The suffering was real.\n\nBut Diamond Princess also contributed to pandemic response. Data from the quarantine informed early understanding of COVID-19 transmission. The protocols developed there—imperfectly, under pressure—influenced subsequent cruise industry response.\n\nDiamond Princess returned to service when cruising resumed. She sails today in Japanese waters, serving passengers who may or may not know her history.\n\nThe honest assessment: Diamond Princess remains an excellent ship. Her 2020 experience doesn't affect her current capabilities. But for some travelers, particularly those who remember watching events unfold, the history resonates.",

      "markdown": "**Diamond Princess sails Japanese waters almost exclusively—serving itineraries designed for Japanese cruisers and visitors exploring Japan by sea.**\n\nThe ship's configuration reflects Japanese preferences. Onboard amenities include Japanese-style public baths. Dining options incorporate Japanese cuisine authentically. Service culture adapts to Japanese expectations.\n\nFrom Japanese homeports—Yokohama, Tokyo, Kobe—Diamond Princess reaches destinations throughout the archipelago. The itineraries serve both Japanese passengers exploring their country differently and international visitors experiencing Japan from the sea.\n\nThe ship's Diamond Class scale suits Japanese ports well. At 116,000 tons and 2,670 passengers, she deploys appropriate numbers to destinations that might struggle with mega-ships.\n\nFor travelers seeking Japan cruises, Diamond Princess offers Japanese-optimized experience unavailable from ships that visit Japan occasionally. The ship understands the market she serves.\n\nThe passenger mix typically includes substantial Japanese participation alongside international travelers. The cultural exchange enriches the experience for everyone aboard.",

      "markdown": "**Diamond Princess and her sister [Sapphire Princess](/ships/princess/sapphire-princess.html) form the Diamond Class—ships larger than Coral Class but smaller than Grand Class with their own distinct character.**\n\nAt 116,000 tons and 2,670 passengers, Diamond Class ships hit an interesting scale point. More variety than Coral Class's intimate 1,970 passengers. More manageable than Grand Class's 3,080. The mathematics create distinct atmosphere.\n\nDiamond Class ships were built in Japan at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, giving them Japanese craftsmanship and construction quality. This heritage shows in attention to detail throughout.\n\nThe original design included unique features like the Izumi Japanese Bath—public bathing facilities reflecting Japanese culture. Diamond Princess maintains these cultural touches that sister Sapphire Princess, deployed differently, may not emphasize.\n\nFor travelers seeking mid-sized Princess experience, Diamond Class offers an option between intimate Coral Class and larger Grand Class. The scale suits travelers who want variety without mega-ship crowds.",
