        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship at Apra Harbor into tropical heat that felt like walking into a steam room—the humidity instant and total, the sun beating down through air thick enough to drink. The smell of plumeria mixed with diesel from the port, and somewhere nearby a radio played a pop song in a language I didn't recognize. This is Guam: American territory, Pacific soul, a place where the familiar and the exotic collide in ways that keep you perpetually off-balance. The US flag flew overhead, but everything else whispered that I had crossed into a different world entirely.</p>

            <p>They call Guam "Where America's Day Begins"—the westernmost point in the United States, fourteen hours ahead of the mainland, the first place American soil greets the sunrise. The island floats in the western Pacific, closer to Tokyo and Manila than to Hawaii, a strategic outpost that has shaped history since Magellan landed here in 1521. However, before the Spanish, before the Japanese occupation of World War II, before the American bases, there were the Chamorro people, whose culture persists beneath the layers of colonization, visible in village fiestas, ancient latte stones, and the faces of everyone I met.</p>

            <p>Two Lovers Point took my breath away. The cliff rises four hundred feet above the Philippine Sea, offering views that stretch to an endless horizon of blue. The legend tells of two young Chamorro lovers who, forbidden to marry, tied their hair together and leaped from this cliff rather than be separated. Standing there with the wind whipping my clothes and the sun turning the water below into brilliant silver, I felt the weight of that story, the desperation and devotion woven into the island's very landscape. Tears pricked my eyes unexpectedly—not for the legend itself but for all the ways love and loss have marked this small island through centuries of change.</p>

            <p>Yet it was the snorkeling at Gun Beach that truly captured my heart. I waded into water so clear I could see individual grains of sand on the bottom, and within moments I was surrounded by a universe of color. Parrotfish in impossible shades of turquoise and pink. Angelfish darting through coral formations that looked like underwater cities. A sea turtle glided past so close I could have touched it, ancient and unhurried, completely unbothered by my presence. I floated face-down for what felt like hours, listening to the strange clicking and humming of the reef, feeling like a visitor to another planet, grateful beyond words for this glimpse beneath the surface.</p>

            <p>Lunch came at a Chamorro restaurant in Hagåtña, the capital village—kelaguen, a traditional dish of grilled chicken mixed with lemon juice, coconut, and hot peppers, served with red rice that gets its color from achote seeds. The flavors were unlike anything I'd tasted: citrusy, coconutty, with a slow heat that built as I ate. Around me, local families gathered for Sunday lunch, children running between tables while elders told stories in Chamorro, a language that somehow survived centuries of colonial suppression. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected feast, this window into a culture so resilient and alive.</p>

            <p>The War in the Pacific Memorial Park brought the past into sharp focus. I walked through remnants of Japanese bunkers and gun emplacements, read plaques describing the brutal battle for Guam in 1944, and stood at the site where American forces landed to liberate an island that had suffered three years of occupation. The Chamorro people had endured forced labor, execution of their leaders, and the destruction of their villages. I thought about the veterans—American and Chamorro—who fought and died on this beautiful island, and about the families who still carry those memories generations later. Some places are more than scenic attractions; some places are sacred ground.</p>

            <p>This is what Guam taught me: that islands hold histories far larger than their size would suggest. This small Pacific territory has been Spanish, American, Japanese, and American again, has served as a stepping stone for empires and a refuge for refugees, has maintained its Chamorro soul through everything. I learned that beauty and tragedy often share the same ground, that the clearest water can float above the darkest history. I learned that "Where America's Day Begins" is also where ancient Pacific culture persists, stubborn and proud, in the shadow of military bases and luxury hotels.</p>

            <p>I felt blessed and privileged to have discovered this complicated, beautiful place. The ship pulled away from Apra Harbor as the sun set over the Philippine Sea, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple that no photograph could capture. I carried with me the taste of kelaguen, the memory of that sea turtle's ancient eyes, and a deepened understanding of what it means to be a small island in a very large world.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at Apra Harbor on Guam's western coast. The port facilities are utilitarian—this is primarily a commercial and naval harbor. Taxi and tour operators meet arriving cruise ships, but there's little to do within walking distance of the port itself. Guam's attractions require transportation.</p>

            <p>The island is 30 miles long and 4-12 miles wide, with attractions spread across its length. Tumon Bay (the tourist and shopping district) is about 20 minutes from the port. Historical sites, viewpoints, and snorkeling locations are scattered throughout the island. Plan to arrange transportation or take a ship excursion.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate depending on activities.</strong> Shopping in Tumon requires minimal effort. Visiting viewpoints like Two Lovers Point involves short walks. Snorkeling is physically moderate. War memorials and historical sites involve walking over uneven terrain. Wheelchair users will find Tumon shopping accessible, but many natural sites have limited accessibility. Budget 6-8 hours for a satisfying exploration.</p>

        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at the port but limited in number for cruise days. Metered rates or negotiate fixed prices. Port to Tumon: approximately $25-30. Port to Two Lovers Point: approximately $35-40. Full island tours by taxi can be negotiated ($100-150 for 4-6 hours).</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer island tours, snorkeling trips, WWII historical tours, and shopping packages ($60-150). Going <strong>independent</strong> is possible but requires planning—taxi availability can be limited. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular snorkeling excursions. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, organized tours eliminate timing concerns.</p>

            <p><strong>Rental cars:</strong> Available from agencies in Tumon (Hertz, Budget, etc.). US driving rules apply—easy for American visitors. Allows flexibility to explore at your own pace. Reserve in advance for cruise days as inventory is limited.</p>

            <p><strong>Public transit:</strong> The Guam Regional Transit Authority operates buses, but service is limited and schedules are inconsistent. Not recommended for cruise visitors with limited time.</p>

            <p><strong>Red Guahan Shuttle:</strong> A hop-on/hop-off shuttle connects Tumon Bay hotels and shopping areas. Useful once you reach Tumon, but doesn't serve the cruise port directly.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The port area is accessible. Tumon shopping centers are modern and accessible with elevators and ramps. Natural sites like Two Lovers Point have some accessibility features but involve uneven terrain. Snorkeling requires water mobility. War memorial sites vary in accessibility—some paved, others on natural ground.</p>

            <h3>War in the Pacific Memorial Park</h3>

            <h3>Snorkeling at Gun Marina</h3>
            <p>One of Guam's best snorkeling spots with clear water, coral formations, and abundant marine life. Sea turtles, parrotfish, angelfish, and reef sharks frequent the area.

During the day, the village is quieter but still offers cultural exhibits and local restaurants. Free entry. Taxi from port $20-25 (15 minutes). Worth visiting if your port day coincides with Wednesday evening.</p>

            <h3>Fort Nuestra Señora de la Soledad</h3>
            <p>Spanish colonial fort dating to 1802, overlooking Umatac Bay where Magellan allegedly landed in 1521. Restored cannons and walls with informative plaques about Guam's colonial history. Peaceful setting with village views. Free access. Located in southern Guam—taxi $50-60 from port (40 minutes). Often combined with island tours. Allow 30-45 minutes. Historical significance exceeds the modest physical remains.</p>

Japanese restaurants reflect the visitor demographics. Fresh seafood is excellent. Local beer ($4-6) is ubiquitous. Prices similar to US mainland in tourist areas, cheaper in local restaurants.</p>

            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> American tipping culture applies—15-20% at restaurants, $1-2 per drink at bars, tip taxi drivers 10-15%. Service workers expect tips as on the US mainland.</p>

            <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Duty-free shopping is a major draw—luxury goods 20-40% cheaper than mainland US. Electronics, cosmetics, and designer brands attract Asian tourists. Local crafts include woven goods and Chamorro jewelry. Avoid buying coral or turtle products regardless of legality.</p>
