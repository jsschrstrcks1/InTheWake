      <!-- LOGBOOK SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="logbook" open>
        <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook</h2></summary>
        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>The Titanic Quarter rose through morning mist as our ship approached Belfast — angular silver architecture marking the exact spot where the world's most famous ocean liner was born. My hands gripped the railing tighter than usual. This was where it all began. I could see the massive yellow cranes of Harland and Wolff shipyard, still standing sentry over the water where workers once assembled a dream that would become a tragedy.</p>

          <p>I walked from the cruise terminal toward Titanic Belfast, and with each step the story grew heavier. This wasn't just a museum I was visiting. This was a graveyard of ambition, a monument to human hubris and engineering brilliance in equal measure. The building itself mirrors the prow of a ship, four angular hulls clad in reflective aluminum. Inside, nine galleries led me through the birth, life, and death of RMS Titanic — from the linen mills that built Belfast's wealth, through the roaring shipyard where 15,000 men worked, to the cold North Atlantic where 1,500 souls slipped beneath the waves.</p>

          <p>However, what broke me open was the shipyard ride. You board a cart and descend into a recreation of the actual slipways where Titanic was built. The sounds of riveting guns surrounded me, the heat of forges, the shouts of workers. I smelled metal and oil and effort. For a few minutes I wasn't a tourist — I was standing where those Belfast men stood, building something they believed would conquer the Atlantic. Nevertheless, I knew how the story ended, and they didn't. That knowledge pressed against my chest.</p>

          <p>Afterward, I took a black taxi tour through the murals. My driver — weathered, funny, unflinching — drove me through Falls Road and Shankill Road, neighborhoods separated by peace walls that still stand today. The murals tell the story of The Troubles in paint: masked gunmen, hunger strikers, martyrs, politicians. Yet alongside the violence are images of hope — Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, peace doves. My driver grew up during the worst of it. "We had to learn to live with each other," he said. "The walls are still here, but the hatred is mostly gone." His voice carried no bitterness, only the exhaustion of survival.</p>

          <p>Giant's Causeway demanded a full day, but every minute was worth it. Two hours north through rolling green hills, past sheep that own the roads, until the coast revealed something impossible: 40,000 hexagonal basalt columns rising from the sea like a giant's stepping stones. I walked down to touch them, ran my hands over their geometric perfection, felt the salt spray on my face. Legend says the giant Finn McCool built this causeway to Scotland. Science says volcanic activity 60 million years ago. I believe both stories simultaneously. Some places are too strange for a single explanation.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> In Titanic Belfast, there's a room with the names of all 1,500 people who died. I stood there reading them — children, stewards, engineers, millionaires — while haunting music played. Then I noticed an elderly woman beside me, touching one name on the wall. "My great-grandfather," she whispered. "He was a stoker. We never found his body." My eyes filled with tears I hadn't expected. She was here to visit someone, not something. That's what changed Belfast for me — realizing that for some families, this museum isn't about the past. It's about finding a place to grieve.
          </div>

          <p>Belfast surprised me. I expected the Titanic museum and found a city still wrestling with its wounds, still building something better from the rubble. The pubs are full of warmth and music. The people are fiercely proud and remarkably kind. I came for a ship and found a whole city that refuses to be defined by its tragedies.</p>

          <p>I spent my last hours in the Cathedral Quarter, listening to live folk music in a Victorian pub, watching locals and tourists share tables and stories. The Guinness was perfect. The craic (conversation) was better. An old man at the bar told me about growing up during The Troubles, about fear and loss and eventually hope. "We're still standing," he said. "And we're building something new."</p>

          <p>That's the lesson Belfast taught me: you can build something magnificent, lose it to the depths, and still wake up the next morning ready to build again. Resilience isn't about forgetting tragedy. It's about carrying it forward and making something worthy of those who came before. I left Belfast grateful for the reminder — grateful for the ship that brought me, for the people who shared their stories, for the city that turned its shipyard ghosts into a place of pilgrimage. What I learned changed how I see ports now. Every harbor has buried something beneath its waters — ships, hopes, lives. Belfast just has the courage to remember publicly what others forget privately.</p>

      <!-- THE CRUISE PORT SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="cruise_port" open>
        <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Docking Location:</strong> Newer ships dock at Belfast's cruise terminal in the Titanic Quarter, just 10-15 minutes walk from Titanic Belfast museum. Older or larger ships may dock at Victoria Terminal, requiring a shuttle or short taxi ride. The cruise terminal has basic facilities — restrooms, tourist information, taxi stand.</p>
        <p><strong>Getting into Town:</strong> Titanic Quarter is walkable for most attractions. City centre is about 20 minutes on foot or £8-10 taxi. Most visitors either walk to Titanic Belfast or take organized tours. The compact nature of Belfast makes it manageable on foot for moderate stamina levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Facilities:</strong> The terminal area offers limited shops but plentiful nearby options. ATMs available. The Titanic Quarter has cafes and restaurants within walking distance. For wheelchair users, the terminal and museum are accessible, though some older city streets can be challenging.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Needed:</strong> Titanic Belfast alone takes 3-4 hours to do properly. Add a mural tour (2 hours) and you've filled a standard port day. Giant's Causeway requires 8+ hours total. Plan accordingly.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="getting_around" open>
        <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Belfast is surprisingly walkable. Titanic Quarter to city centre takes about 20 minutes on foot. The Cathedral Quarter with its pubs and restaurants is central. Low to moderate stamina level for basic exploration; higher for covering multiple areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Black Taxi Tours:</strong> Essential for the mural tour. Book ahead or find taxis at the cruise terminal. Tours typically cost £30-40 per person for 1.5-2 hours. Your driver provides context and stories that no guidebook can match. Ship excursions offer similar routing.</p>
        <p><strong>Hop-On Hop-Off Bus:</strong> City sightseeing buses connect major attractions. About £15 per person. Useful if mobility is limited or weather is poor. Stops include Titanic, city centre, and Cathedral Quarter.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Readily available and reasonably priced. From cruise terminal to city centre about £8-10. Drivers are friendly and informative. Uber operates in Belfast.</p>
        <p><strong>Tours to Giant's Causeway:</strong> Ship excursions cost £80-120 and guarantee return. Independent coaches run from city centre for £30-50. Go independent if you're confident with timing; take the ship excursion for peace of mind. Book ahead either way. The journey is 1.5-2 hours each direction.</p>
        <p><strong>City Orientation:</strong> Belfast is compact and well-signposted. The Titanic Quarter sits northeast of city centre. Cathedral Quarter is walkable from anywhere central. The mural areas (Falls and Shankill Roads) are west of centre — take a taxi or guided tour. Most cruise visitors cover Titanic Belfast plus one other activity comfortably in a standard port day.</p>

        <summary><h2>Excursions &amp; Activities</h2></summary>
        <h3>Titanic Belfast Museum (£22, 3-4 Hours)</h3>
        <p>Built on the exact spot where RMS Titanic was constructed, this is one of the world's great museums. Nine galleries cover Belfast's industrial rise, ship construction, the voyage, the sinking, and the aftermath. The shipyard ride recreates the atmosphere of the slipways. Allow 3-4 hours minimum. Book ahead online to skip queues — tickets sell out during cruise season. Go independent; it's easy to walk from the terminal. Ship excursions available but cost more. Moderate stamina level for walking and standing. Wheelchair accessible throughout.</p>

        <h3>Black Taxi Mural Tour (£30-40 per person, 1.5-2 Hours)</h3>
        <p>Essential Belfast experience. Local drivers take you through Falls Road (Nationalist) and Shankill Road (Loyalist) neighborhoods, explaining The Troubles, the peace process, and the murals that document both. Your driver's personal stories make this unforgettable. Book ahead through your ship or directly with operators like Belfast Black Cab Tours. Ship excursions cost more but guarantee timing. Low stamina level — mostly in the taxi. Accessible for wheelchair users if arranged in advance.</p>

        <h3>Giant's Causeway Day Trip (£80-120 ship / £30-50 independent, 8+ Hours)</h3>
        <p>UNESCO protected site about 60 miles north. Over 40,000 hexagonal basalt columns formed by volcanic activity 60 million years ago. Dramatic coastal scenery, visitor centre, walking trails to the formations. Ship excursions guarantee return; go independent via coaches from city centre if confident with timing. Book ahead for either option. High stamina level if you want to explore the full site; moderate for basic viewing. Some paths are uneven.</p>

        <h3>Crumlin Road Gaol (£15, 1-2 Hours)</h3>
        <p>Victorian-era prison that held prisoners from 1846 to 1996, including many political prisoners during The Troubles. Guided tours tell grim stories of executions, escapes, and daily life behind bars. The execution chamber and condemned cells are sobering. Book ahead for specific tour times — tours fill up during cruise season. Go independent; it's about £10 taxi from terminal each way. Moderate stamina level for walking and stairs. Not fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

        <h3>Cathedral Quarter Walking Tour (Free-£15, 2-3 Hours)</h3>
        <p>Belfast's entertainment district with Victorian pubs, live music, and craft beer. The Crown Liquor Saloon (National Trust property) is a must-see with ornate Victorian interiors — carved wood booths, stained glass, gas lighting preserved since 1885. Kelly's Cellars dates to 1720. Self-guided walks are free; organized tours cost £12-15 per person. No booking needed for independent wandering. Low stamina level. Ship excursions sometimes include pub visits; going independent gives you more flexibility and saves money compared to ship prices.</p>

      <details class="port-section" id="food">
        <summary><h2>Local Food &amp; Drink</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Ulster Fry:</strong> Belfast's legendary breakfast — bacon, eggs, sausages, black pudding, soda bread, potato bread, all fried. Enough calories for a day of exploring. Most pubs and cafes serve it. £8-15.</p>
        <p><strong>Guinness and Irish Whiskey:</strong> Belfast pubs pour excellent Guinness. Irish whiskeys include Bushmills (distilled nearby) and Jameson. A pint runs £5-6; whiskey £4-8.</p>
        <p><strong>Irish Stew:</strong> Lamb, potatoes, carrots, onions — hearty and perfect after a rainy walk. Most pubs offer it. £10-15.</p>
        <p><strong>Soda Bread:</strong> Dense, slightly sweet bread made with buttermilk. Often served with butter at breakfast. A Belfast staple.</p>
        <p><strong>Fish and Chips:</strong> Cod or haddock, battered and fried. Available everywhere. £8-12 for a generous portion.</p>

        <summary><h2>Current Notices</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Belfast weather changes quickly. Bring layers and a rain jacket even in summer. Giant's Causeway is exposed — dress warmly.</p>
        <p><strong>Titanic Museum Tickets:</strong> Book ahead online during cruise season. Walk-up tickets may sell out.</p>
        <p><strong>Peace Walls:</strong> The walls between neighborhoods are still standing but pose no danger to tourists. Mural tours explain their significance.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- DEPTH SOUNDINGS SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="depth_soundings" open>
        <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>The Cons:</strong> Belfast weather is unpredictable. Rain, wind, and sudden changes are common year-round. Giant's Causeway can be windswept and cold even in summer. Pack layers.</p>
        <p>The Titanic Museum is extremely popular with cruise passengers. During peak season, queues can be long and galleries crowded. Book ahead and arrive early. However, even crowded, the museum is worth it — just temper expectations for quiet contemplation.</p>
        <p>Giant's Causeway takes a full day. If your ship has a short port call (under 8 hours), you'll be rushed. The drive is beautiful but long. Ship excursions guarantee return; independent tours offer more flexibility but carry timing risk. Nevertheless, if you have the time, it's unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Belfast's past includes sectarian violence. The Troubles ended with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and the city is safe for tourists. Yet the murals and peace walls are reminders of wounds that haven't fully healed. Approach with respect. The people have earned their peace through hard work and forgiveness.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Belfast safe?</strong><br/>A: Yes. The city has transformed since the 1998 peace agreement. Tourist areas are welcoming and safe. The people are proud to share their city.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should I book Titanic Museum in advance?</strong><br/>A: Yes, especially during cruise season. Walk-up tickets may not be available. Online booking includes timed entry.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the best pub in Belfast?</strong><br/>A: The Crown Liquor Saloon is the most famous — ornate Victorian interior, National Trust protected. Kelly's Cellars is the oldest (1720). Both are in Cathedral Quarter.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like in Belfast?</strong><br/>A: Unpredictable. Rain is common year-round. Summer temperatures hover around 15-20°C (60-68°F). Layers and a rain jacket are essential regardless of forecast.</p>

          Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake. This guide draws from published accounts, fellow cruisers, and careful research — but it does not yet carry the weight of my own anchor. I am working my way through the world's cruise ports, and this page awaits that day.
