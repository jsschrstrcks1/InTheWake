<h2>The Silver Sister</h2>
<p>Mardi Gras proved the concept. Carnivale proved it could repeat. When this second converted ocean liner arrived in 1975, she transformed Ted Arison's gamble into a genuine cruise company.</p>
<p>Originally RMS Empress of Britain (1956), Carnivale was larger than Mardi Gras and carried lessons from that ship's first years. She would sail an extraordinary 52 years under six different names before finally reaching the breakers.</p>
<p>The silver medal position suited Carnivale. She wasn't the pioneer — she was the confirmation that Fun Ships worked as a business model.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Carnivale's contribution to Carnival's success extends beyond her passenger revenue. She validated the business model, proved Mardi Gras wasn't a fluke, and demonstrated that conversion economics worked repeatedly.</p>
<p>Her 52-year lifespan — longer than most ships dream of — proved that quality construction and adaptive management can extend service far beyond original expectations.</p>
