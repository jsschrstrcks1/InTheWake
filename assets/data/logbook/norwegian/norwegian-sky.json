My wife wanted to cruise; I wanted proof I'd survive.\n\n[Norwegian Sky's](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-sky.html) three-day Bahamas cruise was the perfect test.\n\nShort enough that failure wouldn't ruin a vacation. Close to Miami if I needed to escape. Just long enough to actually experience cruising without committing to a week.\n\nBy hour six, I understood the appeal. By day two, I was planning our next cruise. By debarkation, I was a convert.\n\nThe ship's smaller size helped. I could learn the layout in one morning. The Bahamas proximity meant calm waters\u2014no seasickness. The casual atmosphere eliminated formal dinner stress.\n\n'You're smiling,' my wife observed on the last evening.\n\n'I'm planning,' I admitted. 'Which ship should we try next?'\n\n**The truth:** Sky's short cruises exist for skeptics. Test the experience without commitment. Three days proves whether cruising works for you.\n\nI've cruised fifteen times since that test voyage. Sky converted me. The three-day format gave me permission to try something I'd resisted for years.\n\n**The lesson:** First voyages teach what no brochure can\u2014that cruising is less about the ship and more about who you become aboard her.",
