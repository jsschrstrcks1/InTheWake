      "markdown": "**At 92,000 tons and 1,970 passengers, Coral Princess offers intimate Princess cruising for travelers who find larger ships overwhelming.**\n\nThe Coral Class ships—Coral Princess and [Island Princess](/ships/princess/island-princess.html)—represent Princess's commitment to variety. Not everyone wants 3,000+ passenger mega-ships. Some travelers prefer manageable scale.\n\nCoral Princess provides Princess quality at boutique proportions. The dining rooms offer the same service standards as Grand Class, but with fewer fellow passengers. The pool decks feel less crowded. The atmosphere tends quieter.\n\nThe trade-off is variety. Fewer specialty restaurants. Fewer entertainment venues. Simpler children's programming. Coral Princess prioritizes intimacy over endless options.\n\nFor travelers who've enjoyed Princess but found larger ships excessive, Coral Princess offers familiar quality at preferred scale. For newcomers curious about Princess, she provides accessible introduction without mega-ship overwhelm.\n\nThe intimate scale rewards loyalty—crew learn names faster, passengers recognize each other sooner, community develops more naturally.",

      "markdown": "**Coral Princess was built with the Panama Canal in mind. Her dimensions fit the original locks perfectly—creating signature itinerary capability.**\n\nThe original Panama Canal locks limited ship size strictly. Coral Princess's design respected those limits, enabling full canal transits that larger ships cannot accomplish.\n\nThis matters for serious Panama Canal cruising. Full transits—Pacific to Atlantic or reverse—provide the complete experience. Watching your ship squeeze through locks with feet to spare. Seeing both oceans connected. The engineering marvel appreciated from aboard.\n\nCoral Princess's canal expertise has accumulated through years of transits. The officers know the passage. The crew understands the timing. The operation flows smoothly.\n\nThe intimate scale enhances canal viewing. Fewer passengers competing for observation positions. More space on deck during the hours of transit. The experience becomes personal rather than crowd-managed.\n\nFor Panama Canal priorities: Coral Princess delivers the passage as intended—full transit through the original locks, experienced from a ship designed exactly for this purpose.",

      "markdown": "**Coral Princess serves Alaska waters where her intimate scale creates advantages larger ships cannot match.**\n\nAt 1,970 passengers, Coral Princess deploys appropriate numbers to Alaska ports. Ketchikan, Juneau, and Skagway handle this capacity without the crowding that 3,000+ ships create. Shore excursions maintain manageable sizes.\n\nThe viewing experience benefits from intimate scale. Observation decks accommodate everyone without competition for position. Glacier viewing becomes meditative rather than competitive. Wildlife sightings get shared rather than missed.\n\nThe ship's quiet operation—she was built with gas turbine engines for environmental consciousness—suits pristine Alaska waters. Less noise, less vibration, more harmony with the environment she visits.\n\nThe passenger demographic on Coral Princess Alaska sailings tends toward mature nature enthusiasts. Fellow travelers share similar priorities. Conversations focus on wildlife spotted, glaciers witnessed, destinations explored.\n\nFor Alaska priorities: Coral Princess offers intimate scale perfectly suited to scenery-focused cruising. The ship doesn't overwhelm the destinations she visits.",
