      <h3>Surfside Review: Finally, a Neighborhood for Our Littles</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Cruising with a 2-year-old and 4-year-old, I was nervous about keeping them entertained. Surfside made our family cruise actually enjoyable—we spent 80% of our time there and loved every minute.</p>

      <h4>The Splash Areas</h4>
      <p>The baby pool was perfect for our 2-year-old—shallow, warm, and designed for his size. The splash pads kept our 4-year-old running back and forth for hours. No fighting for lounge chairs with adults because the whole space is for families.</p>

      <h4>Surfside Eatery</h4>
      <p>Game changer. Kid food available whenever we needed it, high chairs everywhere, and no judgment when our toddler threw noodles. The casual atmosphere made family meals stress-free. And it's FREE—we ate there at least once a day.</p>

      <h4>Adventure Ocean</h4>
      <p>Our 4-year-old loved Aquanauts. The staff were amazing with her, and she made friends she asked about every day. We got actual adult time while she had structured activities—worth every penny for the extended hours.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>If you have young kids and can sail Icon Class, do it. Surfside alone makes the ship worth choosing. Royal Caribbean finally created a cruise experience that works for families with little ones. <strong>Rating: 5/5.</strong></p>
