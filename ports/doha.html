          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>Doha announced itself long before we docked—towers piercing the Arabian sky in geometries that seemed to ignore physics entirely, buildings spiraling upward like frozen flames, architecture that belonged more in science fiction than in any city I had visited before. Our ship glided past weathered wooden dhows moored in the harbor, their hulls weathered by salt and time, while behind them rose a skyline built on natural gas wealth and pure determination. The contrast felt intentional, almost staged, as if Qatar wanted visitors to understand immediately: this is a place where ancient and future exist in the same breath.</p>

            <p>The Museum of Islamic Art stopped me in my tracks before I even entered. I.M. Pei came out of retirement to design this building, and standing on the artificial peninsula watching morning light play across its limestone facade, I understood why he bothered. The structure rises from the water like geometric prayer—cubes stacked in patterns that echo centuries of Islamic architecture while remaining unmistakably modern. Inside, fourteen centuries of art span continents and empires: ceramics from Persia glazed in colors I had no names for, textiles from Mughal India so fine they seemed woven from light itself, manuscripts from Moorish Spain with calligraphy that flowed like water down parchment pages. But the building competed with its contents. Those massive windows framing Doha Bay, the way afternoon sun transformed the atrium into sacred geometry—my breath caught watching shadows shift across the white walls, patterns within patterns within patterns.</p>

            <p>My wife noticed me standing motionless before a brass astrolabe from twelfth-century Isfahan. "What are you thinking?" she asked. I couldn't answer properly. Something about the precision of it, the faith required to believe that human hands could capture the heavens in worked metal, the patience of the craftsman who spent months or years creating an instrument of navigation and wonder. Tears surprised me. Not sadness—recognition, perhaps. Recognition that beauty persists across centuries, that devotion takes many forms, that some things are worth the time they demand.</p>

            <p>Souq Waqif felt like stepping through a portal into another century. The ancient souq sprawls through narrow alleys where spice vendors sell saffron measured in precious grams, where the scent of frankincense and oud perfume drifts past stalls selling everything from embroidered textiles to live falcons. Yes, falcons—Qatar's falconry legacy runs deep, and in the Falcon Souq elderly Qatari men examine birds with the focused tenderness of surgeons, their hands gentle and knowing. I watched one handler speak softly to a peregrine, the bird's dark eyes following his movements, its tiny leather hood embroidered in gold thread. Above us, skyscrapers gleamed. Two timelines occupied the same moment, neither diminishing the other.</p>

            <p>We ate lunch in a souq restaurant where the waiter brought dishes without us ordering—hummus scattered with pomegranate seeds, lamb machboos fragrant with dried lime and cardamom, flatbread still warm from the oven. The flavors were complex, layered, nothing like the bland approximations served in hotel buffets. My wife tried karak chai—spiced tea with cardamom and saffron, so sweet and strong I could feel it in my teeth. Around us, Qatari families shared meals alongside tourists, children running between tables while grandmothers watched with patient amusement. The souq has been restored, carefully preserved—this is careful preservation, not accidental authenticity—but the energy felt genuine. This is where Doha remembers itself.</p>

            <p>The Corniche stretched seven kilometers along the bay, and we walked most of it as the day cooled toward evening. Palm-lined promenades, manicured parks, classic dhow harbor where boats still operate despite the towers behind them. Joggers passed us in expensive athletic wear; families spread picnic blankets on the grass; photographers positioned tripods for the moment when the setting sun would light the skyline on fire. And it did—the buildings transformed from silver to gold to crimson as the sun dropped into the Persian Gulf, colors I had only seen in heavily filtered photographs, impossible except that I was watching it happen.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing on the Museum of Islamic Art's outdoor terrace at sunset, the city blazing behind us, my wife's hand in mine, both of us silent in the face of something we couldn't quite articulate. The call to prayer echoed from a nearby mosque, mixing with the sound of boat engines and distant traffic, and I felt my heart swell with gratitude for being exactly where we were, exactly when we were. Not joy—something quieter. The privilege of witnessing a place that honors its past while building what seems impossible. Looking back now, Doha taught me that ambition and ancestry need not be enemies, that a nation can dream in glass and steel while remembering its roots in desert sand and ancient wisdom.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at the Grand Cruise Terminal at Doha Port, positioned dramatically on the Corniche waterfront with the city's futuristic skyline as backdrop. The modern dual-terminal facility—built for Qatar's ambitious tourism expansion—can handle up to 12,000 passengers daily at two berths. From the terminal, Souq Waqif is approximately 10 minutes by taxi; the Museum of Islamic Art is even closer at roughly 5 minutes. The Corniche promenade begins essentially at the port exit.</p>

            <p>Currency is the Qatari Riyal (QAR); ATMs are available at the terminal and throughout the city, and credit cards are widely accepted. Arabic is the official language, but English is spoken extensively in tourism, business, and service contexts—navigation is straightforward for English speakers. Modest dress is expected out of respect for local customs: cover shoulders and knees, and women should bring a light scarf for religious sites. Qatar is a Muslim country; alcohol is available only in licensed hotels and venues, not in old-quarter areas or public spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> The Corniche is flat and highly walkable. The Museum of Islamic Art and Souq Waqif require moderate walking but offer air-conditioned relief. Summer months (May-September) see extreme heat exceeding 40°C—limit outdoor exposure during midday. October through April offers comfortable temperatures (20-30°C) ideal for exploration.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The Corniche waterfront is excellent for walking—flat, well-maintained promenades stretching seven kilometers along Doha Bay. The Museum of Islamic Art to Souq Waqif is a pleasant 20-minute walk along the bay. Sidewalks in tourist areas are excellent. Summer heat limits practical walking distances.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Karwa taxis (official turquoise vehicles) are plentiful and metered. Port to Souq Waqif costs approximately 20-30 QAR ($5-8). Uber and Careem also operate throughout the city. Drivers generally speak English. Taxis offer the most practical transport for cruise passengers on limited time.</p>

            <p><strong>Metro:</strong> Doha's ultra-modern driverless metro opened in 2019 for the FIFA World Cup. The Gold Line serves Souq Waqif and Msheireb Downtown. Clean, efficient, and affordable—worth considering for longer distances or simply to experience world-class infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Qatar's modern infrastructure—built largely for the 2022 FIFA World Cup—offers excellent accessibility throughout the city center. The metro system is fully accessible with elevators at all stations. The Museum of Islamic Art has wheelchair access throughout its galleries and public spaces. Souq Waqif's narrow historic alleys present some challenges, but main pathways and restored sections accommodate wheelchairs, and staff are generally helpful. The Corniche promenade is flat, paved, and fully accessible along its entire seven-kilometer length.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Doha rewards both structured tours and independent exploration. The compact location of major attractions makes this an excellent port for going <strong>independent</strong>—taxis are affordable, English is widely spoken, and the main sights cluster near the waterfront. <strong>Ship excursion</strong> packages offer convenience and <strong>guaranteed return</strong>, particularly valuable for desert trips or combination tours. For major attractions, <strong>book ahead</strong> is rarely necessary—most sites welcome walk-in visitors.</p>

            <h3>Museum of Islamic Art</h3>
            <p>I.M. Pei's architectural masterpiece housing 1,400 years of Islamic art from three continents. World-class collection of ceramics, textiles, metalwork, and manuscripts in a 45,000 square meter building on an artificial peninsula. Free admission. Café with stunning bay views. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. The building itself justifies the visit—this is museum architecture at its finest. Air-conditioned comfort makes it perfect midday refuge. Go independent—5-minute taxi from port or 25-minute walk along Corniche. Low stamina. Fully accessible.</p>

            <h3>Souq Waqif</h3>
            <p>Arabian souq in Doha's heart—labyrinth of alleys selling spices, perfumes, textiles, handicrafts, and live falcons at the famous Falcon Souq. Carefully restored historic site with genuine local energy. Open daily 9am-10pm (later weekends). Free to explore; budget for purchases ($20-100+ depending on finds). Meals available at local eateries ($15-40 per person). Allow 2-3 hours for browsing. Best authentic experience in Doha. Go independent—10-minute taxi from port. Moderate stamina for extended exploration. Mostly accessible on main pathways.</p>

            <h3>Doha Corniche Walk</h3>
            <p>Seven-kilometer waterfront promenade curving along Doha Bay offering spectacular skyline views, palm-lined walkways, parks, and the classic dhow harbor. Popular for walking and photography. Best at sunset when skyscrapers ignite with reflected light. Free. Accessible directly from cruise terminal. Allow 1-2 hours for leisurely walk. The contrast between wooden dhows and futuristic towers captures Qatar's identity perfectly. Go independent—no booking needed. Low stamina on flat terrain. Fully accessible.</p>

            <h3>Katara Village</h3>
            <p>Sprawling arts district featuring galleries, amphitheater, performance spaces, restaurants, and beachfront. Classic architecture meets contemporary design. Free entry to grounds; events and performances vary. Located 15-20 minutes from port by taxi ($15-20). Allow half-day if attending performances; 1-2 hours for grounds exploration. Photography opportunities throughout. Ship excursion combines well with other attractions. Moderate stamina. Mostly accessible.</p>

            <h3>Desert Safari</h3>
            <p>Half-day or full-day excursions into Qatar's interior desert—dune bashing in 4x4 vehicles, camel rides, sandboarding, authentic Bedouin camp experiences with Arabic coffee and dates. Full-day tours include dinner and Arabian entertainment. Ship excursion recommended ($120-200)—logistics and guaranteed return timing essential for cruise passengers. Not practical as independent trip given distances and timing constraints. Book ahead through ship or reputable operators. Moderate stamina for active participation; options for observers. Limited accessibility on desert terrain.</p>

            <h3>The Pearl-Qatar</h3>
            <p>Man-made island featuring luxury boutiques, upscale dining, marina with superyachts, Mediterranean-style architecture. Dubbed "Arabian Riviera"—distinctly opulent modern development. Free to explore; boutique and dining prices premium. Located 20 minutes from port by taxi ($20-25). Allow 1-2 hours unless serious browsing intended. Not old-world Qatar, but showcases the country's contemporary ambitions. Go independent by taxi. Low stamina. Fully accessible throughout.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Falconry legacy:</strong> Qatar's falconry lineage spans millennia—not sport but survival skill, passed through generations when hunting in the desert required partnership with birds. The Falcon Souq at Souq Waqif maintains this living practice where falcons are examined, traded, and treated with ceremonial respect. Falconry remains part of Qatari identity despite the country's transformation; some families maintain birds worth more than luxury cars.</p>

            <p><strong>Transformation timeline:</strong> In 1950, Doha was a small pearl-diving settlement of perhaps 14,000 people. The discovery of natural gas transformed Qatar into one of the world's wealthiest nations per capita. The skyline that now defines Doha—those spiraling towers and geometric impossibilities—rose essentially within a single generation. This is not ancient wealth but recent ambition made visible in steel and glass.</p>

            <p><strong>World Cup legacy:</strong> Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup, spending an estimated $220 billion on infrastructure including eight stadiums, an entirely new metro system, highways, and tourism facilities. The infrastructure cruise passengers now enjoy—excellent roads, driverless metro, modern terminals—represents this massive investment. The tournament's controversies (labor conditions, climate concerns) accompany its architectural achievements.</p>

            <p><strong>Religious context:</strong> Qatar follows Wahhabi Islam, and public behavior reflects this—alcohol restricted to licensed venues, modest dress expected, public displays of affection discouraged. The country welcomes tourism while maintaining its values. Visitors who respect local customs find Qataris genuinely hospitable. The call to prayer echoing across the Corniche while skyscrapers glow behind classic dhows captures a nation navigating between preservation and transformation.</p>

          <p class="author-note"><em>These soundings in another's wake reflect one family's experience.

What stays with me is the recognition that a nation can honor its past while building what seems impossible.</em></p>
