      "markdown": "**We'd become strangers in the same house.**\n\nTwenty-six years married, but we hadn't really connected in three months. We'd learned to exist side by side without truly seeing each other.\n\nThe [Alaska cruise](/ports.html) on Radiance was my wife's idea. \"Glass walls everywhere,\" she said, reading reviews. \"Nothing to hide behind.\" I thought she was being poetic. She was being prophetic.\n\nRadiance's design forced honesty. Floor-to-ceiling windows in our [balcony cabin](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html), glass elevators exposing us as we moved through the ship, the Centrum's transparent architecture making every space feel open. You can't hide on a ship made of glass.\n\nAt Hubbard Glacier, we stood at the Deck 11 viewing area — silent, separate, watching ancient ice calve into the sea. Thunder echoed across the water. My wife whispered Ecclesiastes: \"*There is a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh.*\"\n\n\"Which time is this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Both,\" she said, and took my hand for the first time in ninety days.\n\nThat night at [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), we didn't talk about fixing everything. We talked about the glacier, the salmon at [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), the pianist in the [Centrum](/ships.html). Small things. Safe things. The things we'd stopped sharing.\n\nBy the last night, we renewed our vows unofficially at the glass elevators, watching the Inside Passage slide past. Not because everything was fixed — but because glass walls teach you that brokenness doesn't have to be hidden to be healed.\n\n**The lesson:** Radiance's transparent design is a metaphor. Marriage needs windows, not walls. See [our marriage restoration cruise guide](/articles.html) and [packing list for couples](/packing-lists/couples-cruise.html)."

New environments triggered meltdowns that could last hours. Our therapist suggested water — \"Oceans have rhythm. Autistic brains respond to rhythm.\"\n\nRadiance's layout saved us. Unlike mega-ships with confusing neighborhoods, Radiance stacks decks vertically in logical order. Ethan mapped it in two days: elevators here, [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) there, pool deck up, cabin down. Predictability = peace.\n\nThe glass walls became his obsession. He'd stand at the Centrum watching the elevators rise and fall, pressing his hands against the windows, tracking movement. Sensory input without sensory overload. The [Solarium](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) became his sanctuary — warm, enclosed glass, gentle water features, soft light.\n\nDay five, at Tracy Arm Fjord, Ethan stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows and said his longest sentence ever: \"God made ice mountains for us to see Him better.\"\n\nI dropped my coffee. My wife sobbed. The couple next to us — veterans of Radiance's Alaska run — high-fived Ethan without making eye contact (they understood sensory boundaries).\n\nThe [crew](/ships.html) adapted without us asking. The [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html) server brought Ethan's chicken plain and early. The youth staff let him line up toy boats in silent rows while other kids played loudly. Nobody forced, nobody fixed, nobody pitied.\n\n**The truth:** Not every ship understands neurodiversity. Radiance's logical layout, natural light, and predictable rhythm gave our son room to be himself.

Not too small to get bored.\" This would be number eight. And the last.\n\nWe booked an [accessible cabin](/accessibility.html) with a balcony. Grandpa spent mornings there wrapped in blankets, watching the Inside Passage slide past, coffee in his shaking hands. He'd quote Psalms: \"*The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.*\"\n\nThe glass elevators became our daily ritual. Three generations riding silently to Deck 11, Grandpa in his wheelchair, watching mountains rise from the sea through floor-to-ceiling windows. \"This is my cathedral,\" he whispered at Glacier Bay. \"This is where I meet God.\"\n\nAt [Giovanni's Table](/restaurants/giovannis.html), the server who'd served Grandpa on two previous sailings recognized him. She brought him tiramisu \"on the house\" and held his hand while he prayed over the meal. She cried when he blessed her by name.\n\nGrandpa passed six weeks after we docked. But at his funeral, his grandchildren didn't talk about cancer. They talked about Radiance — the glaciers, the whales, the way Grandpa laughed at the towel animals, the Scripture he'd quote at every port. The ship gave us a final gift: not more time, but *better* time.\n\n**The lesson:** Death doesn't wait. But Radiance's [accessible design](/accessibility.html) and intimate scale mean you can travel with dignity even in final days.

But Michael and I had planned this Alaska trip for fifteen years. I couldn't let his death kill the dream too.\n\nRadiance felt manageable. At 2,466 guests, it wasn't the anonymous chaos of mega-ships or the claustrophobic intimacy of small expedition boats. I could be alone without being lonely. I could grieve without being watched.\n\nThe first morning, I sat in the [Solarium](/ships.html) reading 1 Thessalonians 4: \"*Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.*\" I had hope. But grief still felt crushing.\n\nAt [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), a crew member noticed me eating alone and seated me with two other women — both widows, both on their first solo cruise. We didn't plan it. God did. We spent the week sharing tables, sharing stories, sharing the strange new weight of wedding rings worn out of memory, not marriage.\n\nAt Mendenhall Glacier, standing at Radiance's glass walls watching ice older than nations, I laughed for the first time in a year. A real laugh. A seal had photobombed someone's selfie. Silly. Ridiculous. Healing.\n\nMichael would have loved that seal.\n\n**The truth:** Grief doesn't have a timeline. But on Radiance, surrounded by widows who understood and creation that declared God's faithfulness, I learned to breathe differently.

Floor-to-ceiling windows showing endless horizon. No sudden movements. No hidden threats. Just water and sky meeting in infinite peace. I left the curtains open and slept nine hours straight. First time since Kandahar.\n\nThe [Solarium](/ships.html) became my sanctuary. Glass-enclosed, warm, quiet. Mornings I'd sit there with coffee from [Café Latte-tudes](/restaurants.html), reading Philippians 4: \"*And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.*\"\n\nI met another vet at the glass elevators — Marine, Iraq, same haunted eyes. We didn't swap war stories. We swapped silence. Watched glaciers calve. Counted whales. Breathed together. Brothers who'd seen too much learning to see beauty again.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), the server asked about my challenge coin on the table. When I explained, he brought his own — Army, Desert Storm. We prayed over the meal together, two warriors grateful to be home, grateful to be alive, grateful for ships that sail through calm waters.\n\n**The lesson:** PTSD doesn't vanish at sea. But Radiance's predictable rhythm, endless ocean views, and veteran-friendly community helped me breathe without hypervigilance.

But at fifty-one, I was NED (no evidence of disease), and my husband insisted: \"We're going to Alaska. We're going to *live*.\"\n\nRadiance's mid-size design meant I could explore without exhaustion. My stamina was still rebuilding — long walks through mega-ship corridors would've wrecked me. But Radiance? Manageable. [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) to cabin: three minutes. Deck 4 to Deck 11: one elevator. Rest when needed. Move when able.\n\nThe [balcony](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) saved me on hard days. When crowds felt overwhelming or fatigue hit, I could retreat without missing the journey. Watch Alaska slide past from my own private refuge. Cancer had taught me to honor my body's limits. Radiance's design respected them.\n\nWe renewed our vows at Glacier Bay — unofficially, just us at the glass walls. \"In sickness and in health\" now meant something fierce. We'd lived the sickness. This was the health part. This was the *victory*.\n\nAt the [Chef's Table](/restaurants.html), when the sommelier learned our story, he brought champagne. \"To beating the odds,\" he toasted. I wept into my lobster bisque — not from grief, but from wonder. I was *here*. Tasting things. Feeling things. Alive.\n\n**The truth:** Surviving isn't the same as thriving. But Radiance gave us space to celebrate being alive without pretending recovery is linear.

Just give me one week together.\"\n\nShe booked Radiance for all of us — me, my partner, my brother, Dad.\n\nThe first two days were ice. Dad wouldn't make eye contact at [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html). I sat as far from him as geometry allowed. Mom looked heartbroken. My partner asked if we should disembark at Juneau.\n\nBut Radiance's glass walls forced something unexpected: transparency. At Glacier Bay, we all stood at the same windows watching ice thunder into the sea. Dad quoted Job: \"*From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens?*\"\n\nI answered without thinking: \"*When the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?*\" First words we'd exchanged in six years. Scripture we both knew by heart.\n\nThat night at [Giovanni's Table](/restaurants/giovannis.html), Dad prayed over the meal. He included my partner by name. Not acceptance — not yet. But acknowledgment. Movement. Grace.\n\nBy week's end, we weren't fixed. But we were *talking*. The [Solarium](/ships.html) became our meeting place — neutral ground where we could sit in silence or share small truths without the pressure of resolution.\n\n**The lesson:** Reconciliation isn't one conversation. It's a hundred small steps. Radiance's intimate scale and transparent design gave us space to try. See [our family reconciliation travel guide](/articles.html)."

No sermons. No counseling. No email.\" I protested that the sheep needed a shepherd. They reminded me that Jesus is the Good Shepherd, and I'm just hired help.\n\nThe first days I paced Radiance's Promenade Deck like a caged animal. Ministry had trained me to *produce*. But cruise ships demand you receive. Meals appear in the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). Entertainment happens whether you attend or not. The ocean moves without your effort.\n\nOn day four, in the [Solarium](/ships.html), I opened my Bible. Not to study — to *listen*. Psalm 46: \"*Be still, and know that I am God.*\" The Spirit whispered: \"Let Me shepherd you.\"\n\nI sat there five hours doing nothing while Radiance carried me through the Inside Passage. No sermon prep. No crisis intervention. Just a burned-out pastor being pastored by the Chief Shepherd.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), I thanked the server by name, learned her story, prayed with her when she mentioned her sick father. Not pastoral duty — pastoral *overflow*. Rest had refilled what ministry emptied.\n\nWhen I returned to my church, I preached from Exodus 33: Moses in the cleft of the rock, hidden while God's glory passed by. \"Sometimes,\" I told my congregation, \"the most spiritual thing you can do is let God hide you in the ship's hull while He does His work.\"\n\n**The lesson:** You can't pour from an empty cup. Radiance taught me Sabbath isn't laziness — it's trust. See [our minister's sabbatical guide](/articles.html) and [pastoral rest packing list](/packing-lists.html)."

Grab bars positioned exactly where my functioning left hand could reach them. Roll-in shower wide enough for my wheelchair. Emergency call buttons everywhere. The crew noted my mobility limits without making me feel broken.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), the server automatically placed my water glass on my left side — the side that still worked. At [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), staff helped cut my food without me asking, then disappeared so I could maintain dignity.\n\nBut the real miracle happened at the glass walls.

It's designed for travelers who *want* to watch the water, not just be on it. When you sail through Alaska's Inside Passage or glide past Sydney's harbor at dawn, those glass walls transform from architectural detail to front-row seats.\n\nAt about 2,466 guests (double occupancy), Radiance feels mid-sized—big enough for variety (you'll find [Royal Caribbean's](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) signature entertainment and specialty dining), small enough that you won't get lost finding your cabin or spend half your sea day navigating endless corridors.

You're reading in the Solarium and look up to see a pod of dolphins keeping pace. You're waiting for an elevator and catch the first glimpse of a glacier calving in the distance. The architecture keeps pulling your attention outward. [Alaska sailings](/ports.html) especially benefit from this: Radiance was *made* for scenic cruising.\n\n**Mid-size navigation.** You can walk from bow to stern in under ten minutes. Elevators are rarely crowded—no seven-stop waits like the mega-ships. The [Windjammer buffet](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) has actual breathing room at breakfast; you're not playing Tetris with your tray. On embarkation day, you don't feel like you're boarding a floating city. You feel like you're boarding a *ship*.\n\n**Classic Royal Caribbean reliability.** Main dining room with attentive service. [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html) when you want a proper steak. Solid entertainment—Broadway-style shows, live music, comedians who've been doing this for years. Familiar layout that doesn't require a map app to find the pool. If you've sailed [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) before, Radiance won't surprise you—but it won't disappoint either. It's the ship equivalent of a well-worn leather jacket: comfortable, dependable, exactly what you need.\n\n**Global itineraries.** Radiance has sailed everywhere: Alaska in summer, Caribbean in winter, Australia, Asia, transatlantic repositioning cruises where you wake up to open ocean for days. It's a ship built for *going places*, not just circling the same seven-night loops forever. If you're the type who picks cruises for the itinerary first and ship second, Radiance often ends up on your shortlist."

It's been refurbished—you won't find peeling paint or worn carpets—but don't expect cutting-edge tech or the newest venues. The TVs in your cabin won't stream Netflix. The pools are functional, not Instagram-worthy. The fitness center has treadmills and free weights, not Peloton bikes or juice bars.\n\n**Smaller dining variety.** You'll find the essentials ([main dining room](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), Windjammer, [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html), Chef's Table, a few bars), but not the 20+ venue spread of [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) or [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html).

If you want calm, you'll find it. If you thrive on constant energy and activity, you might feel like something's missing.\n\n**Itinerary over amenities.** If you're choosing Radiance, you're probably choosing it for *where* it goes—[Alaska's glaciers](/ports.html), Australia's Great Barrier Reef, transatlantic crossings, repositioning cruises that call at ports the big ships skip—rather than onboard thrills.
