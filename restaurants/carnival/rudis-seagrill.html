      <h3>Rudi's Seagrill Review: Carnival's European Seafood Concept</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Rudi's Seagrill is Carnival's European-inspired seafood restaurant, named after Rudi Sodamin — Holland America's master chef and a Carnival Corporation culinary figure. Available on select Excel-class ships, it's a surcharge venue (~$42 per person) that focuses on fresh seafood with European technique — think Provençal flavors, Mediterranean preparations, and plating that actually cares about presentation.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The Dover Sole meunière is the signature dish and earns it — whole fish, tableside deboning, brown butter, capers, lemon. It's the most elegant dish on any Carnival ship. The seafood tower appetizer (oysters, shrimp, crab, lobster) is a showpiece that actually delivers on flavor — the oysters are fresh and the shrimp is properly chilled. The Bouillabaisse is rich and well-seasoned with saffron, fennel, and a good variety of shellfish. The Lobster Thermidor is indulgent and classic. Where it dips: the non-seafood options (chicken, steak) feel like afterthoughts for companions who don't eat fish — they're fine but not why you're here. The crème brûlée is standard. The wine list emphasizes French and Italian whites, which suits the menu — the Sancerre pairing with the Dover Sole is spot-on.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>This is Carnival's most polished service experience outside the Chef's Table. The tableside Dover Sole deboning is theatrical in the best way — the server clearly practices this. Wine service is knowledgeable. The pace is appropriately unhurried for a $42 cover, and courses are timed well. Reservations are required and should be made early — this venue is small and fills quickly.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The design is Rudi Sodamin's artistic vision — bright, slightly whimsical, with his signature food-as-art paintings on the walls. It's a more visually interesting space than most cruise ship restaurants. The room is intimate (smaller than Fahrenheit 555 or Il Viaggio), which helps create a refined, special-occasion feeling. Lighting is warm, noise level is low, and the overall energy says "this is a nice dinner, not just another cruise meal."</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Rudi's Seagrill is Carnival's best seafood restaurant and one of the strongest specialty dining options on the Excel-class ships. The Dover Sole and seafood tower are worth the cover alone, and the Bouillabaisse is legitimately good. It loses a fraction for the uninspired non-seafood options, the standard desserts, and the limited availability (not on all ships). If you eat seafood and you're on a ship that has Rudi's, this should be your top specialty reservation. <em>Tip:</em> order the Dover Sole — the tableside presentation alone is worth the experience.</p>
