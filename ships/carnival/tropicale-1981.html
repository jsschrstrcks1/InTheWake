<h2>The Ship That Changed Everything</h2>
<p>Before Tropicale, every Carnival ship was a converted ocean liner. Tropicale was different — she was the first ship Carnival ordered new, designed specifically for Fun Ship operations from keel to funnel. No conversion compromises. No inherited limitations. Pure Carnival DNA.</p>
<p>She carried the iconic winged funnel that Joe Farcus designed, a signature that every Carnival ship still wears today. Tropicale proved purpose-built vessels outperformed conversions.</p>

<section class="card">
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Every cruise ship built since owes something to Tropicale. She proved that cruise lines could design and build their own ships. The winged funnel she debuted still flies on every Carnival ship. The Danish engineering principles applied to her construction still influence shipyard decisions. The prototype made everything else possible.</p>
