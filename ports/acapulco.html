          <h2>My Logbook: Where Courage Dives Into Legend</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've been fascinated by Acapulco since I first learned about La Quebrada as a child — those images of divers plunging from impossible heights into churning Pacific waters have stayed with me for decades. Yet nothing I've read quite captures what travelers describe when they witness it firsthand. The photographs show the height, the rocks, the narrow cove, but they can't convey the collective gasp of the crowd, the held breath, or the eruption of applause when the diver surfaces triumphant. I'm planning my visit with that moment in mind.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/acapulco/cliff-diver-action.webp" alt="La Quebrada cliff diver mid-dive plunging toward the Pacific Ocean with arms outstretched against the rocky cliffs" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>La Quebrada cliff diver — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What draws me to Acapulco is its layered story — a city that was once the crown jewel of Mexican tourism, where Hollywood stars vacationed in the 1950s and Elvis filmed his famous movie. Though the city has weathered challenges over the decades, including Hurricane Otis in October 2023, the spirit of Acapulco endures. The cliff divers still climb those rocks. The bay still gleams at sunset. Recovery continues with characteristic Mexican resilience, and cruise ships have returned to support the city's revival.</p>

            <p>My research into La Quebrada has revealed a tradition stretching back to 1934 when local fishermen first began diving from these cliffs for tourists. However, the skill required is extraordinary — divers must time their jump precisely with the incoming wave to ensure sufficient water depth in the narrow cove. Too early and they risk hitting submerged rocks. Too late and the wave recedes, leaving dangerously shallow water. They climb 135 feet barefoot up jagged rocks, pause at a small shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and dive — arms outstretched like crucifixes — into the Pacific.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/acapulco/fort-san-diego.webp" alt="Star-shaped Fort San Diego fortress with colonial stone walls and cannons overlooking Acapulco Bay" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Fort San Diego — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Beyond the cliff divers, I'm drawn to Fort San Diego — a perfectly preserved star-shaped Spanish fortress from 1616 that once guarded the Manila Galleon trade route. The Nao de China, as these treasure ships were called, sailed from Acapulco to the Philippines and back, carrying silk, porcelain, and spices that shaped the colonial economy. My fascination with maritime trade routes makes this museum essential to my visit. The views from the ramparts sweep across Acapulco Bay, and the air-conditioned galleries offer welcome relief from the Pacific heat.</p>

            <p>I'm also planning a trip to Isla la Roqueta, the island nature reserve visible from downtown. Glass-bottom boats depart from Playa Caleta, offering views of the underwater Virgen de los Mares statue before reaching the island's beaches. My research suggests spending 2-3 hours there for snorkeling, swimming, and a leisurely seafood lunch. The boat ride takes only 10 minutes, making it accessible even on a shorter port day.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>What I'm Most Looking Forward To:</strong> Watching a diver climb to the highest platform as the sun sets behind him, kiss the shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, cross himself, and leap into the Pacific. Every account I've read describes that moment — the collective gasp, the held breath, the applause when he surfaces. That's what draws me to Acapulco: courage passed down through generations, beauty earned through risk.
            </div>

            <p>The Terminal Marítima sits in downtown Acapulco, just 15 minutes walking to the Zócalo (main plaza). I've noted the taxi fares — around $5-10 USD to most attractions — and plan to use licensed taxis from the port. My itinerary prioritizes the 1pm cliff diving show, which fits cruise schedules better than the evening performances at 7pm, 8pm, and 9pm. The evening shows feature flaming torches, yet they often conflict with ship departure times.</p>

            <p>Mexican cuisine excites me as much as the sightseeing. I'm researching the best ceviche spots — fresh fish marinated in lime juice with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro is an Acapulco specialty. Pescado a la talla (grilled fish marinated in chili sauce) represents the Pacific coast at its finest. And of course, a Coco Loco — that dangerous coconut cocktail filled with rum, tequila, and tropical juices — seems essential for the full Acapulco experience.</p>

            <p>The city's recovery from Hurricane Otis has shown remarkable progress. Major cruise attractions are operational, though some areas still bear scars. I view my visit as both tourism and solidarity — supporting a community that has endured devastating loss while maintaining its welcoming spirit. The cliff divers never stopped diving. The restaurants reopened. The bay still catches the golden Pacific light. Acapulco perseveres, and I'm honored to witness its resilience firsthand.</p>

            <p>My planning has convinced me that Acapulco offers something unique in the cruise world — a destination where human courage meets natural beauty, where colonial legacy intersects with modern Mexico, and where the simple act of watching a man dive from impossible heights into the sea becomes a meditation on faith, skill, and the human spirit. I'm going with respect for what this city has endured and excitement for what it continues to offer.</p>

          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Terminal Marítima serves as Acapulco's cruise gateway, located in the downtown area with easy access to the city's main attractions. The terminal offers basic facilities including restrooms, taxi coordination, and tour operator desks. Ships dock directly at the pier — no tender required.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">
            <img src="/ports/img/acapulco/cruise-terminal.webp" alt="Acapulco cruise terminal with ship docked at pier and palm-lined waterfront promenade" loading="lazy">

          </figure>

          <p>The terminal area is wheelchair accessible with flat pathways to the taxi area and tour buses. Distance to attractions: 15-minute walk to Zócalo, 10-minute taxi to La Quebrada cliff divers, 10-minute taxi to Fort San Diego. Currency is Mexican Peso (MXN), though US dollars are widely accepted at tourist areas. Credit cards work at major establishments. Spanish is the primary language with some English at tourist sites.</p>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION - 200+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown and the waterfront malecón are walkable from the port. The Zócalo (main plaza), Cathedral, and waterfront are within 15-20 minutes on foot. Not recommended for La Quebrada or distant beaches due to heat and distance.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Plentiful at the port with a taxi coordinator. Always agree on fare before departure — typically $5-10 USD (90-180 MXN) to most tourist destinations. Use licensed taxis from the port area for safety. Tipping 10-15% appreciated.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Recommended for La Quebrada, Isla la Roqueta, and city highlights. Ship excursions offer convenience and guaranteed return times. Local tour operators at the terminal offer competitive rates — compare before committing.</li>
            <li><strong>Glass-Bottom Boats to Isla la Roqueta:</strong> Depart from Playa Caleta beach, about 10 minutes by taxi from port. Round-trip approximately $5-10 USD per person. Views of underwater Virgin statue en route.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Inexpensive but routes are complex and not recommended for cruise visitors unfamiliar with the city.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but not recommended — traffic is chaotic, parking difficult, and organized tours or taxis more practical for a cruise day visit.</li>
            <li><strong>Wheelchair Access:</strong> Port terminal has flat pathways. Major attractions vary — Fort San Diego has ramps, La Quebrada involves stairs (La Perla restaurant offers accessible viewing). Beaches have limited accessibility. Inform tour operators in advance of mobility needs.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Playa Caleta &amp; Caletilla:</strong> Twin beaches closest to the port, about 10 minutes by taxi. Calm, protected waters ideal for swimming. Glass-bottom boats to Isla la Roqueta depart from here. Beach chairs, umbrellas, and seafood restaurants available. Good for families.</li>
            <li><strong>Playa Condesa:</strong> Main tourist beach in the Hotel Zone. More developed with restaurants, bars, and water sports. Rougher waves than Caleta. 15-20 minutes from port by taxi.</li>
            <li><strong>Playa Hornos:</strong> Long beach along the bay with a mix of public and hotel areas. More local atmosphere than Condesa. Calm waters, family-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Isla la Roqueta:</strong> Island nature reserve with pristine beaches, snorkeling, and the underwater Virgin statue. 10-minute boat ride from Playa Caleta. Entry to island is free; boat fare $5-10 USD round-trip.</li>

          <h2>Shore Excursions &amp; Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: La Quebrada cliff divers require no advance booking — just show up (small viewing fee). Fort San Diego museum requires no reservation. Ship excursions offer convenience but independent visits are straightforward and often cheaper. Local tour operators at the terminal can arrange half-day tours on the spot.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">La Quebrada Cliff Divers</h4>
          <p>Acapulco's iconic attraction since 1934. Professional divers climb 135 feet up jagged cliffs, pause at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, then plunge into a narrow cove, timing their dive with incoming waves. Shows daily at 1pm (best for cruise schedules) and evenings at 7pm, 8pm, 9pm (torch-lit performances). View from the public platform (around 50 MXN / $3 admission) or from La Perla restaurant/bar (drinks required, premium views). Allow 1 hour including travel time. 10 minutes from port by taxi (around $5 each way). Absolutely unmissable and truly unforgettable.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fort San Diego (Fuerte de San Diego)</h4>
          <p>Star-shaped Spanish fortress built in 1616 to protect the Manila Galleon trade route from pirates. Now houses an excellent museum on the Nao de China — ships that sailed to the Philippines carrying silk, porcelain, and spices. Stunning bay views from the ramparts. Air-conditioned galleries offer relief from heat. Entry approximately 80 MXN ($5). Open 9am-6pm daily. 10-minute walk from port, uphill. Allow 1-2 hours for the full museum experience.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Isla la Roqueta</h4>
          <p>Island nature reserve across the bay from downtown. Glass-bottom boats from Playa Caleta reveal the underwater Virgen de los Mares statue en route. The island offers swimming beaches, snorkeling, hiking trails, and seafood restaurants. Boat fare $5-10 USD round-trip, departing regularly throughout the day. Allow 2-3 hours including boat rides. Family-friendly and refreshing escape from the city. Bring snorkeling gear or rent on the island.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Chapel of Peace (Capilla de la Paz)</h4>
          <p>Hilltop chapel offering 360-degree panoramic views over Acapulco Bay. Non-denominational and open to all visitors. The winding road up provides scenic views. About 15 minutes from port by taxi ($8-10). Great for photography enthusiasts. Verify current accessibility as some areas may still be recovering post-hurricane.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Cathedral of Our Lady of Solitude</h4>
          <p>Beautiful 1930s cathedral with distinctive blue Byzantine-style domes, located on the main Zócalo plaza. Cool interior provides welcome break from Pacific heat. Free entry and open to visitors daily. 15-minute walk from port. Combine with downtown exploration, market browsing, and a traditional Mexican lunch at one of the plaza-side restaurants serving authentic regional cuisine.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ceviche:</strong> Fresh fish marinated in lime juice with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro — the quintessential Acapulco dish. Try at beachfront restaurants or the central market.</li>
            <li><strong>Pescado a la Talla ($$):</strong> Grilled whole fish marinated in red or green chili sauce — Pacific coast specialty. Look for restaurants near Playa Caleta.</li>
            <li><strong>La Perla Restaurant ($$):</strong> Cliff-side restaurant at La Quebrada with premium cliff diver views. Drinks required for viewing; food available. Mexican and international menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Mercado Central ($):</strong> Downtown market with authentic, inexpensive Mexican food. Tacos, pozole, and fresh juices. Adventurous option for authentic local flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Beachfront Palapas ($-$$):</strong> Open-air restaurants on Caleta and Caletilla beaches serving fresh seafood, ceviche, and cold beers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Budget tip: The 1pm cliff diving show means you can lunch afterward at one of the nearby restaurants. Coco Loco (coconut cocktail with rum and tequila) is the signature beach drink — dangerously refreshing.</p>
          <p>Note: Drink bottled water only. Avoid ice in drinks outside established restaurants. Fresh fruit with lime and chili is a safe and delicious street snack.</p>

          <p>Acapulco sits on Mexico's Pacific coast in Guerrero state, about 300 km south of Mexico City. The city was once Mexico's premier resort destination, and while it has faced challenges in recent decades, the welcoming spirit and natural beauty remain. Currency is the Mexican Peso (MXN), with approximately 17 pesos to the US dollar. USD is widely accepted in tourist areas, but you'll get better value using pesos. ATMs are available at the port and downtown.</p>

          <p>Safety in tourist areas is generally good during daytime. Standard precautions apply — use licensed taxis, avoid displaying valuables, and stick to well-traveled routes. The cruise terminal area, La Quebrada, Fort San Diego, and main beaches are regularly patrolled and cruise-tourist friendly. Avoid venturing into unfamiliar neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The port and main attractions are reasonably wheelchair accessible, though some areas have uneven pavement. Fort San Diego has ramps to the museum entrance. La Quebrada viewing area involves stairs; the restaurant La Perla offers easier access. Beaches vary — Caleta has the most established facilities with some beach wheelchair access available.</p>

          <p>Cell service is good in tourist areas. Free WiFi available at many restaurants. Spanish is the primary language — English is spoken at major tourist sites but not universally. A few basic Spanish phrases are appreciated and useful.</p>
