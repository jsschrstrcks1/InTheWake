Evidence leans toward no major disruptions from expansions, but some ports like Miami and Port Canaveral may experience temporary construction impacts. Accessibility is generally strong across terminals, though older infrastructure in places like Bayonne could pose minor challenges. Safe flight times post-disembarkation vary by proximity to airports, but noon or later is commonly recommended to account for potential delays."
