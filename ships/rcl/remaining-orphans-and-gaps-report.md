## Priority Actions

### High Priority:
1. **Delete 3 non-RCL images** (Celestyal Olympia, MSC World America x2)
2. **Verify 2 "already used" images** are properly integrated (Independence, BOS)
3. **Create media JSON for Quantum** (reference model should have media file)
4. **Research Oslo series** (4 images from Sept 2, 2014)

### Medium Priority:
5. **Create media JSON for 14 active ships** with inline images
6. **Identify June 2018 Bahamas cruise ship** (3 images)
7. **Review personal photos** ((1).webp, "1") - relocate or delete

### Low Priority:
8. **Research 7 generic location photos** (may require visual identification)
9. **Investigate Kirchdorf image** (may not be cruise ship)
10. **Resolve ambiguous "liberty-radiance-wonder" image**

## Next Steps

1. Delete the 3 non-RCL ship images
2. Create media JSON files for remaining 30 ships with images
3. Research Oslo and June 2018 Bahamas images
4. Consider manual visual identification for remaining 7 location-based images
5. Remove/relocate personal photos if confirmed

**Goal:** Reduce orphaned images from 24 to <10 unidentifiable images
