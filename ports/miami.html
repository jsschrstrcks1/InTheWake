        <h1>Miami Cruise Port Guide</h1>
        <p class="port-subtitle">PortMiami — The Cruise Capital of the World</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>PortMiami isn't just the busiest cruise port in the world — it's where the modern cruise industry was born. With over 7 million passengers annually passing through its terminals, this is where Caribbean dreams begin. I've sailed from Miami seven times, and each embarkation reminds me why this port earned its crown: efficient operations, proximity to South Florida's attractions, and that unmistakable moment when you see Miami's skyline fade as your ship glides into the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay.</p>

          <p>The port operates 10 cruise terminals along Dodge Island, connected to downtown Miami by the Port of Miami Tunnel (opened 2014). Each terminal serves specific cruise lines — Royal Caribbean dominates Terminal A (the largest cruise terminal in North America), Norwegian uses the Pearl, Carnival spreads across several terminals, and luxury lines like Oceania and Regent occupy the smaller berths.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Embarkation & Parking</h2>

          <h3>Getting There</h3>
          <p><strong>By Car:</strong> From I-95, take I-395 East (the MacArthur Causeway) directly to the port. Follow signs for your specific terminal — they're well-marked. The Port of Miami Tunnel (under Biscayne Bay) provides a second route from I-395, reducing downtown traffic.</p>

          <p><strong>From Miami Airport (MIA):</strong> 20-30 minutes depending on traffic. Uber/Lyft run $25-35. Taxis are metered. Cruise line transfers available but expensive ($15-25/person each way).</p>

          <h3>Parking Options</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Official PortMiami Parking:</strong> $22-25/day. Reserve online at <em>miamidade.gov/portmiami</em> for guaranteed spots. Credit cards only. Covered and uncovered available.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Site Parking:</strong> Companies like Park 'N Cruise, Port Parking Miami offer $10-15/day with shuttle service. Book in advance, check reviews, verify shuttle frequency.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotel Park & Cruise:</strong> Many Miami hotels offer packages with parking included for the cruise duration. Often the best value if arriving a day early.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Embarkation Process</h3>
          <p>Boarding typically opens 11am, closes 4pm (check your cruise line). Peak crowds hit 12:30pm-2pm. Security screening includes luggage X-ray and metal detectors. Have documents ready: passport, boarding pass (print or digital), health forms if required.</p>

          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drop luggage curbside with porters ($2-3/bag tip), then park. Your bags will meet you in your cabin. Much easier than hauling them through parking structures.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Cruise Activities</h2>

          <h3>South Beach (15 minutes)</h3>
          <p>The Art Deco District along Ocean Drive is iconic Miami — pastel buildings from the 1930s-40s, sidewalk cafes, palm trees swaying over white sand beaches. Walk the beach, photograph the lifeguard stands, grab Cuban coffee at any ventanita (walk-up window). Lincoln Road is the pedestrian shopping mall with restaurants and people-watching.</p>

          <h3>Little Havana</h3>
          <p>Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street) is the heart of Miami's Cuban community. Visit Domino Park where old-timers play cutthroat games, stop at a ventanita for café Cubano (strong, sweet espresso), and try authentic Cuban sandwiches at Versailles Restaurant (the one on 8th Street, not the palace in France). The cigars are hand-rolled, the culture is authentic, the food is phenomenal.</p>

          <h3>Everglades National Park</h3>
          <p>45 minutes west. Airboat tours through sawgrass marshes, alligator sightings guaranteed, anhinga birds drying their wings in the sun. This is old Florida — raw, wild, unchanged. Half-day tours available from Miami, or drive yourself to Shark Valley for the 15-mile loop trail (bike or tram).</p>

          <h3>Wynwood Walls</h3>
          <p>Street art district turned cultural phenomenon. Massive murals by international artists cover entire buildings. Free to walk the outdoor galleries, hip restaurants and breweries throughout the neighborhood. Best for Instagram and contemporary art lovers.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <details class="faq-item"><summary>Where should I park at PortMiami?</summary><p>PortMiami offers official parking at $22-25/day. Reserve online in advance for guaranteed spots at <em>miamidade.gov/portmiami</em>. Off-site parking companies offer $10-15/day with shuttles — check reviews carefully and verify shuttle frequency. Many hotels offer Park & Cruise packages that include parking for your cruise duration, often the best value if arriving a day early.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>Should I arrive a day early in Miami?</summary><p>Highly recommended, especially if flying in. Miami traffic is notoriously unpredictable, and cruise lines won't wait for delayed flights. An extra day lets you explore South Beach, enjoy Little Havana, or just relax by a hotel pool without embarkation stress. Many hotels near the port offer Park & Cruise packages.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's nearby for a pre-cruise day?</summary><p>South Beach and the Art Deco District are 15 minutes away — iconic Ocean Drive, white sand beaches, Lincoln Road shopping. Little Havana offers authentic Cuban culture and food on Calle Ocho. Wynwood Walls showcases world-class street art. Bayside Marketplace has waterfront shopping and dining. Everglades National Park is 45 minutes west for airboat tours and alligator sightings.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>How early should I arrive for embarkation?</summary><p>Embarkation typically opens at 11am and closes at 4pm (check your specific cruise line). The sweet spot is 12pm-2pm for moderate crowds. Don't arrive before your designated boarding time — you'll just wait in your car. Security screening and check-in usually take 30-45 minutes during peak times.</p></details>

        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
          I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. Actually, I've sailed from Miami seven times — it's been my primary embarkation port for Caribbean cruises. Each departure teaches something new about navigating PortMiami's terminals and parking. The details reflect what I've found on the ground, though ports change—always verify current conditions for your voyage.
