      "markdown": "**Regatta launched with Oceania in 2003 as one of the ships that defined the brand—intimate, culinary-focused, destination-intensive.**\n\nOceania acquired R Class ships from Renaissance Cruises' bankruptcy. At 684 guests, these vessels offered intimacy that mega-ships couldn't match. Oceania built identity around this scale.\n\nThe original vision persists: finest cuisine at sea, country club elegance, destination discovery. Regatta embodies what Oceania meant before Marina Class and Allura Class growth.\n\n[Insignia](/ships/oceania/insignia.html), [Nautica](/ships/oceania/nautica.html), and [Sirena](/ships/oceania/sirena.html) share the R Class platform. Together, they represent Oceania's intimate fleet—the original brand experience at original scale.\n\nFor brand purists: Regatta delivers what made Oceania distinctive. The larger ships may offer more amenities, but the R Class ships preserve founding intimacy. Some guests never sail the newer ships—the R Class satisfies completely.",

      "markdown": "**684 guests transforms cruise experience. Regatta's R Class scale creates intimacy that larger ships—even Oceania's own—cannot replicate.**\n\nYou know fellow passengers. The dining room hosts recognizable faces. The pool deck welcomes without competition. The bars buzz with conversations among familiar companions.\n\nCrew know your name. At this scale, personalization isn't programmed—it's natural. Your preferences noted on day one inform service throughout. The recognition compounds across the voyage.\n\nThe atmosphere feels like private club rather than public resort. Fellow travelers share sensibilities—they chose R Class intimacy deliberately. The community that forms reflects self-selection.\n\nFewer amenities than larger ships—smaller spa, limited entertainment venues. But guests who choose R Class prioritize atmosphere over options. The trade-off rewards those who understand it.\n\nFor intimate priorities: Regatta offers what size provides—community, recognition, atmosphere. If you've cruised larger ships and found them impersonal, R Class answers that concern.",

      "markdown": "**Regatta's intimate scale enables itineraries that larger ships cannot serve—exotic destinations, boutique ports, off-the-beaten-path discovery.**\n\nAt 684 guests, Regatta fits ports that larger Oceania ships skip. Pacific islands, remote Asian harbors, smaller African ports. The R Class opens destinations closed to Marina and Allura Class vessels.\n\nOceania deploys R Class ships to adventurous itineraries deliberately. The brand understands that exotic discovery often requires intimate scale. Regatta regularly explores regions that mega-ships cannot access.\n\nThe destination-focused passengers who choose Regatta care about access over amenities. They accept fewer onboard options for richer port experiences. The trade-off makes sense to them.\n\nCulinary excellence travels with the ship regardless of destination. Whether visiting South Pacific islands or Baltic capitals, the dining quality persists. Oceania's standards are fleet-wide.\n\nFor exotic priorities: Regatta enables destinations that require smaller ships. The intimate scale isn't limitation—it's access. Where do you want to go that larger ships cannot?",
