  "description": "Wat Arun, the most iconic temple of Bangkok is located on Thonburi side of Bangkok, almost opposite to the Grand Palace and Wat Pho. Built during seventeenth century on the bank of the Chao Phraya river, its full name 'Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan' is rather hard to remember so it is often called 'Temple of Dawn. The distinctive shape of Wat Arun consists of a central 'Prang' (a khmer style tower) surrounded by four smaller towers all incrusted with faience from plates and potteries. The stairs to reach a balcony on the main tower are quite steep, usually easier to climb up than to walk down, but the view from up there is really worth it.",
