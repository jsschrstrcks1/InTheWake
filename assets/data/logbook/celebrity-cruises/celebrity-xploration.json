The entire Galápagos.**\n\n[Celebrity Xploration](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-xploration.html) wasn't a cruise ship in any traditional sense. She was an expedition yacht—a luxury catamaran carrying just sixteen guests through the Galápagos Islands. Smaller than any other Celebrity vessel by orders of magnitude.\n\nAt this scale, the word 'cruise' barely applied. This was a private yacht experience with naturalist guides and Celebrity's service standards. Guests dined together. Explored together. Became friends by necessity and pleasure.\n\nThe catamaran design allowed different access than traditional ships—shallower waters, different anchorages, unique perspectives on the islands. She was for travelers who wanted Galápagos without any crowd at all.\n\n**The truth:** Xploration represented expedition cruising at its most exclusive. The vessel has retired, but she showed what ultra-intimate expedition could be.\n\nThose who sailed Xploration remember the exclusivity. The yacht that made Galápagos entirely personal.",

      "markdown": "**A catamaran moves differently through waters. Xploration used that difference.**\n\n[Celebrity Xploration](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-xploration.html) was a power catamaran—twin hulls providing stability and shallow draft that monohull ships couldn't match. She could anchor where larger vessels couldn't reach, approach islands from angles others couldn't attempt.\n\nThe ride differed too. Catamarans handle swells differently, track through chop with twin-hull stability. For some guests, this meant greater comfort. For others, simply a different sensation of Galápagos waters.\n\nAt 98 feet, she was yacht-scale—intimate in ways that even small expedition ships like Xperience couldn't match. The lounge held everyone. The dining table seated all sixteen.\n\n**The design:** Xploration showed what catamaran expedition could offer. The yacht has left the fleet, but her approach informed Celebrity's understanding of scale and access.\n\nThose who sailed Xploration remember the catamaran experience. The vessel that moved differently through paradise.",

By the first dinner, you knew everyone's names. By the second day, you knew their stories. By mid-voyage, you were planning reunions.\n\nThe catamaran's common spaces fostered this—everyone in one lounge, everyone at one table. No retreating to private corners. No avoiding conversation. The ship's design demanded connection.\n\nFor some travelers, this intimacy was the point. They chose Xploration precisely because sixteen guests meant real relationship. Others found it more intense than expected. Either way, no one forgot their Xploration companions.\n\n**The connection:** Xploration created bonds that larger ships can't replicate. The yacht has retired, but the friendships she forged continue.\n\nThose who sailed Xploration remember their fellow passengers as vividly as the wildlife. The voyage where everyone mattered equally.",
