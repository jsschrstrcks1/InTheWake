It's been refurbished, but don't expect cutting-edge tech or newest venues. Cabins are smaller. Dining variety is limited. The pool deck is functional, not Instagram-worthy.\n\nBut if you want *cruising*—not theme-parking at sea—Rhapsody delivers. Attentive crew who remember your name. Traditional dining room with proper service. Manageable size where you can find the library, spa, or your cabin without a map. Glass-walled design for spectacular ocean views.\n\nRhapsody is the ship you choose when you understand what it's trying to be: a floating hotel for beautiful ports, designed for travelers who'd rather explore the Mediterranean than ride a surf simulator.\n\nSee [other Vision-class ships](/ships.html) for similar intimate experiences, or compare to [Radiance class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) for glass-wall design in a slightly larger package.",

      "markdown": "**Everyone talks about Alaska cruises like they're luxury-only. We did Alaska for $1,100 per person, all-in.**\n\nMy wife and I saved for three years for Alaska. We researched ships, read reviews, compared prices. The newer ships — [Ovation](/ships/rcl/ovation-of-the-seas.html), [Quantum](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) — were $2,500-3,000 per person for 7 nights. Beautiful ships, but out of our budget.\n\nRhapsody's Alaska sailing was $1,100. Same ports: Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Icy Strait Point. Same glaciers. Same whales. Same excursions.\n\nDifferent ship.\n\nRhapsody is Vision Class, built in 1997. Smaller (2,000 guests vs. 4,000 on newer ships). Fewer amenities (no robot bartenders or surf simulators). Older cabins. But here's what mattered in Alaska:\n\nThe scenery is outside the ship.\n\nWe spent maybe 2 hours per day in our cabin (sleeping). The rest of the time we were on deck watching glaciers calve, spotting whales, hiking in Juneau, riding the White Pass railway in Skagway. The ship was transportation and a bed. It didn't need to be cutting-edge.\n\nWhat Rhapsody did well:\n- **Viewing decks:** Plenty of outdoor space, never crowded, perfect for glacier watching\n- **Service:** Smaller ship meant crew remembered our names, preferences, stories\n- **[Main dining room](/ships/rcl/rhapsody-of-the-seas.html#dining-card):** Traditional dining, excellent food, attentive servers\n- **Glass elevators and Centrum:** Signature Vision Class design with panoramic views\n- **Port timing:** Same port calls as expensive ships, same shore excursion options\n\nWere the cabins tiny? Yes. Did we care? No. Was the pool deck packed on sunny days? Sometimes. Did that matter when we were watching humpback whales breach 50 feet from the ship? Not even a little.\n\nWe saved $1,400 per person by choosing Rhapsody over Ovation. Used that savings for excursions: helicopter glacier landing ($350), whale watching expedition ($180), salmon bake dinner ($80). Those experiences mattered infinitely more than having a robot bartender.\n\nAlaska is one of those destinations where the ship takes a backseat to the scenery. Save the money. Book the smaller ship. Spend the difference on experiences you'll actually remember.\n\nSee our [Alaska cruise guide](/ports.html) and [budget travel tips](/planning.html).",

      "markdown": "**My mother is 78. She uses a walker. She was terrified of cruising.**\n\n\"Too big,\" she said when we suggested a family cruise. \"I'll get lost. I'll slow everyone down. I'll be stuck in the cabin.\"\n\nWe chose Rhapsody specifically because it's smaller and because of the glass elevators. Vision Class ships have this signature design: glass-walled elevators in the center atrium (the Centrum) that face outward as you ride. You can see where you're going. You can orient yourself.\n\nThat mattered more than we realized.\n\nMom could look out of the elevator and know where she was: \"Oh, that's the dining room level.\" \"That's where the shops are.\" \"That's our deck.\" The visual reference points gave her confidence. She wasn't trapped in a metal box wondering where she'd end up.\n\nThe ship's compact size helped too. Our cabin to the dining room: two-minute walk. Cabin to the Windjammer buffet: three minutes. Cabin to the pool deck: one elevator ride and a short walk. Mom could navigate independently without exhausting herself.\n\nThe crew noticed her walker day one and went out of their way to help. They'd hold elevator doors. They'd carry her tray at the buffet. They'd offer chairs in busy areas. Not in a pitying way — in a \"we see you and we've got you\" way.\n\nBy day three, Mom was walking to breakfast alone. By day five, she was joining the trivia contests in the Centrum. By the end of the cruise, she was staying up for the late-night shows.\n\n\"When are we booking the next one?\" she asked on disembarkation day.\n\nWe've sailed Rhapsody three times since. Different itineraries, same ship. Mom's 81 now. Still uses the walker. Still cruises confidently on Rhapsody.\n\n**Accessibility notes:** Royal Caribbean has accessible cabins with wider doors, roll-in showers, grab bars. Request them when booking. Smaller ships like Vision Class are easier to navigate than mega-ships. Glass elevators provide visual orientation that helps everyone, but especially those with cognitive or mobility concerns.\n\nSee our [accessible travel guide](/planning.html) and [senior cruising tips](/articles.html).",

      "markdown": "**We didn't discover Park Cafe until day four. We'd been missing out.**\n\nMost people do the same thing on cruises: buffet for breakfast and lunch, main dining room for dinner. Maybe hit the pizza place late night. Repeat for seven days.\n\nWe were doing exactly that on Rhapsody until a crew member mentioned Park Cafe. \"It's near the Solarium,\" she said. \"You should try it for lunch.\"\n\nWe almost didn't. The buffet was fine. Why complicate things?\n\nDay four, we gave it a shot.\n\nPark Cafe is small — maybe 30 seats — tucked near the adults-only Solarium pool. The menu changes daily but focuses on fresh-made sandwiches, paninis, salads, and soups. Everything is made to order, not sitting under heat lamps.\n\nI got a caprese panini: fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic reduction, grilled on ciabatta. It was *good*. Not \"good for a cruise\" — just good. Better than most cafes on land.\n\nMy wife got a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken, feta, olives, and a lemon vinaigrette that actually tasted like lemons, not bottled dressing.\n\nWe sat outside by the Solarium pool (quiet, adults-only, peaceful) and ate real food in the sunshine while half the ship was crammed into the Windjammer buffet.\n\nWe went back every day for the rest of the cruise. Tried the Cuban sandwich (excellent). The tomato soup with grilled cheese (comfort food perfection). The Greek wrap (fresh, tangy, satisfying).\n\nHere's the secret: Park Cafe is complimentary. No extra charge. Same as the buffet or pizza place. But it's tucked away enough that most guests don't know it exists or don't bother trying it.\n\nTheir loss.\n\n**Why it works:** Small space means limited capacity, which means they can focus on quality. Made-to-order means fresh. Near the Solarium means quieter atmosphere. It's everything the buffet isn't: calm, fresh, personal.\n\nNot every Royal Caribbean ship has Park Cafe — it started on [Oasis Class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) and has been added to select ships including Rhapsody. If your ship has it, skip the buffet mob scene and try the cafe instead.\n\nSee our [complimentary dining guide](/restaurants.html) for more hidden gems.",

      "markdown": "**For our 25th anniversary, we wanted romance, not roller coasters.**\n\nWe'd seen the ads for Icon of the Seas, Wonder of the Seas, all the mega-ships with their waterparks and robot bartenders. They looked impressive. They also looked exhausting.\n\nWe're 52 and 54. We don't need surf simulators. We wanted quiet dinners, ocean views, and time together without fighting through crowds of 7,000 people.\n\nRhapsody had 2,000 guests. That difference changed everything.\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge became our evening ritual. It's this gorgeous observation lounge that wraps around the top of the ship, almost entirely glass walls. We'd get drinks, find a corner table, and watch the sunset over the ocean. Some nights we barely talked—just sat there, holding hands, watching the light change.\n\nOn mega-ships, that lounge would have been packed. On Rhapsody, we often had it nearly to ourselves.\n\nDinner was similar. The main dining room served traditional meals with proper courses. Our server, Ramon, learned our preferences by night two. \"The filet for Mr. Johnson, medium-rare, and the sea bass for Mrs. Johnson?\" He didn't need to ask.\n\nBy the end of the week, he'd greet us by name and have our wine poured before we sat down. That's not possible when servers are juggling 400 covers.\n\nWe danced in the Centrum on formal night while a small orchestra played standards. We found a quiet spot on the aft deck and watched our wake trail behind us for hours. We read books by the Solarium pool without kids cannonballing next to us.\n\nIt felt like a cruise ship, not a theme park at sea.\n\nRhapsody won't wow you with Instagram-worthy attractions. But if you want to actually spend time with the person you're celebrating—talking, connecting, remembering why you chose each other 25 years ago—it's perfect.\n\nSome things don't need to be bigger to be better.\n\nSee our guide to [romantic cruise destinations](/ports.html) and [anniversary planning tips](/planning.html).",

      "markdown": "**After my husband passed, friends kept telling me to try cruising. It took me two years to book.**\n\nI was 67, traveling alone for the first time in 40 years. The thought of being on a ship with 5,000 strangers terrified me. What if I got lost? What if I ate every meal alone? What if something happened and I couldn't get help?\n\nI chose Rhapsody because it was small. 2,000 guests. Manageable.\n\nBest decision I could have made.\n\nThe ship's compact size meant I learned my way around by day two. Cabin to dining room: straight down the hallway, down two decks, turn left. Cabin to pool: up three decks, walk forward. Simple. I never once felt lost or overwhelmed.\n\nThe crew noticed I was alone and looked out for me. My cabin steward asked if I needed anything. The maitre d' seated me at a table with other solo travelers the first night—three other women, all traveling alone, all around my age. We became friends by the end of dinner.\n\nWe spent the whole cruise together. Shore excursions. Deck games. Evening shows. One of them, Margaret, and I still email monthly.\n\nI didn't eat a single meal alone unless I wanted to. And sometimes I did—there's something peaceful about breakfast with a good book and an ocean view.\n\nRhapsody's pace suited me. No pressure to try waterslides or attend pool parties. The library was well-stocked. The spa was tranquil. The Solarium was quiet. There were activities if I wanted them and peace if I didn't.\n\nI've cruised solo three more times since. Tried bigger ships—didn't love them. The crowds were overwhelming. I felt anonymous. On Rhapsody, I felt known.\n\nIf you're considering your first solo cruise, especially if you're older or nervous: start small. Ships like Rhapsody are designed for actual cruising, not overwhelming you with options. You can always try bigger ships later.\n\nBut you might find, like I did, that smaller is exactly what you needed.\n\nSee our [solo cruising guide](/solo/why-i-started-solo-cruising.html) and [tips for older travelers](/planning.html).",

She gets tired easily. She has zero interest in water slides, rock climbing walls, or anything requiring standing in line.\n\nThe twins want activities. Pools. Kids' club. Ice cream machines. They have endless energy.\n\nRhapsody somehow worked for both.\n\nThe ship is small enough that Mom could walk from our cabins to the pool deck, dining room, or Centrum without exhausting herself. On bigger ships, she'd have been stuck in the cabin half the day, too tired to participate.\n\nBut it's big enough to have Adventure Ocean (the kids' club), a decent pool, and enough activities to keep the twins entertained. They spent mornings in the kids' program while Mom read by the Solarium pool. We'd meet for lunch in the buffet—a two-minute walk for everyone.\n\nAfternoons, we did things together. The glass elevators fascinated the kids and helped Mom orient herself. They'd race to the elevator; she'd meet us there at her pace. Nobody felt left out.\n\nDinner was the best part. The main dining room let the kids order off the regular menu (they loved the shrimp cocktail) while Mom enjoyed proper service and conversation. The twins learned table manners; Mom got adult time with grandkids who weren't running wild.\n\nBy the end of the week, Mom had taught the twins to play Scrabble in the card room. The kids had convinced Grandma to try the soft-serve ice cream machine. Everyone had memories.\n\nThat's what multigenerational cruises should be: not separate experiences happening on the same ship, but actual time together. Rhapsody's size made that possible.\n\nBigger ships separate generations—grandparents in one area, kids in another, everyone meeting for meals. Rhapsody kept us together.\n\nSee our [family cruise planning guide](/planning.html) and [accessible travel resources](/accessibility.html).",

      "markdown": "**22 years in the Army taught me to appreciate things that actually work over things that look impressive.**\n\nMy wife wanted to try cruising. I was skeptical. Cruise ships looked like floating cities—crowded, chaotic, overwhelming. After years of deployments, I'd had enough chaos.\n\nRhapsody was her compromise with me. Smaller. Older. Quieter.\n\nShe was right.\n\nThe ship had maybe 2,000 guests—small enough that I could learn the layout in one day. Port side, starboard side, forward, aft. Made sense. I never felt lost or hemmed in.\n\nThe crew was excellent. Professional. Attentive without being intrusive. They reminded me of good NCOs—doing their jobs well, anticipating needs, not making a big show of it. When I mentioned I was a veteran at dinner, our server said, \"Thank you for your service\" and that was it. No production. Just respect.\n\nRhapsody had quiet spaces when I needed them. The library. The Viking Crown Lounge in the mornings (deserted before 10am). The aft deck at night. When crowds at the pool got to be too much, I could find solitude within five minutes.\n\nMy wife got the cruise experience she wanted. I got peace I could handle.\n\nThe ship's age actually helped. It felt like *a ship*, not a theme park. Traditional. Functional. Well-maintained but not flashy. The Centrum had a grand staircase and a nice bar, but no robot bartenders, zip lines, or simulated skydiving. Just a ship doing what ships do: taking you places in reasonable comfort.\n\nI've since tried larger ships with my wife. They're fine. But Rhapsody remains my favorite because it never tried to overwhelm me. It just worked.\n\nFor fellow veterans, especially those who prefer quieter environments: Vision Class ships like Rhapsody might suit you better than mega-ships. Smaller crew-to-guest ratio means better service. Smaller ship means fewer crowds. And the glass-walled design gives you clear sightlines—you can always see where you are and where the exits are.\n\nSmall ship, big heart.

Giving that up would have been another loss.\n\nI chose Rhapsody because it was smaller. Less overwhelming. And because James and I had sailed Vision Class ships early in our marriage—before kids, before careers, before everything got complicated. Going back felt right.\n\nThe first dinner was hard. I sat at a table for one in the main dining room, looking at all the couples around me. My server, Maria, noticed. She didn't say anything pitying—just made sure my wine glass was never empty and that the kitchen knew I liked my steak rare.\n\nBy the second night, she'd moved me to a larger table with other solo travelers. Four of us, all different stories, all alone for different reasons. We became each other's dinner companions for the week.\n\nRhapsody gave me space to grieve and space to heal.\n\nI could sit in the Viking Crown Lounge, watching the sunset, thinking about James without interruption. Or I could join trivia in the Centrum and laugh with my new friends. Both were available. Neither was forced.\n\nThe crew seemed to understand. They were attentive without being intrusive. When I mentioned it was my first cruise alone, they nodded with something like recognition. I wasn't the first widow they'd seen finding her way back to the sea.\n\nOn the last night, I stood on the aft deck and watched our wake disappear into the darkness. James would have loved this, I thought. Then: James would have wanted me to love it too.\n\nI've sailed three times since. Sometimes on Rhapsody, sometimes on other ships. But that first solo cruise—the one everyone thought was a mistake—was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe sea doesn't ask you to explain yourself. It just carries you forward.\n\nFor others traveling after loss: smaller ships like Rhapsody let you control your experience. You can be social or solitary. You can find community or find peace. The crew on smaller ships notice you, care for you, remember your name.

Real books. Leather chairs. Ocean views. Quiet. \"This is all I need,\" he said.\n\n**The space.** Rhapsody has less than half the passengers of mega-ships. He could find corners of the deck where nobody else was. He'd take his book and a cup of coffee to the aft railing and sit there for hours, watching the wake and the glaciers. Not bothered.
