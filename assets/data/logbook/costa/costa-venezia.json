      "markdown": "**Costa Venezia launched in 2019 as floating tribute to Venice—perhaps Italy's most distinctive and threatened city.**\n\nThe design translates Venice throughout the ship. The Casanova Restaurant evokes palazzo dining. The Carnival Piazza recreates the famous celebration. Murano glass chandeliers reference the nearby island's centuries-old craft. Bridge of Sighs imagery appears thoughtfully.\n\nVenice faces uncertain future—rising waters, declining population, overtourism. Costa Venezia preserves the city's aesthetic spirit in maritime form. The ship becomes ambassador for Venetian culture worldwide.\n\nThe Venezia Class—this ship and [Costa Firenze](/ships/costa/costa-firenze.html)—was designed initially for Asian markets, bringing Italian culture to Chinese passengers. Both ships now serve global itineraries, sharing Venetian and Florentine heritage universally.\n\nFor Venice lovers: Costa Venezia offers immersion in the city's aesthetic even far from the Adriatic. The tribute feels authentic rather than themed. Venice's spirit sails.",

      "markdown": "**Costa Venezia was designed for Chinese cruisers—creating fascinating fusion of Italian hospitality and Asian passenger expectations.**\n\nThe ship includes features uncommon on European-focused vessels. Mahjong rooms. Asian dining options alongside Italian classics. Entertainment programming that spans Eastern and Western traditions. The cultural bridge works in both directions.\n\nNow serving broader global itineraries, Costa Venezia attracts passengers interested in this cultural fusion. The Asian-influenced facilities remain, creating unique onboard atmosphere that purely Italian or purely Asian ships don't provide.\n\nThe Venetian theme resonates across cultures. Venice's exotic beauty—its Moorish influences, Byzantine connections, Eastern trade history—speaks to travelers regardless of origin. The city always bridged East and West.\n\nFor adventurous cruisers: Costa Venezia offers genuinely different cruise experience. The cultural mixing creates atmosphere that standard European or American ships don't attempt.",
