    <article class="card"><h1>Cadiz: My Ancient Andalusian Dream</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>I stepped off the ship into the oldest continuously inhabited city in Western Europe, and the weight of 3,000 years settled over me like a warm blanket. The Phoenicians founded "Gadir" here in 1100 BC, and every civilization since — Greek traders, Roman senators, Moorish scholars, Spanish explorers — has left their fingerprints on these sun-bleached stones. The city sits on a slender peninsula with the Atlantic Ocean wrapping around it nearly 300 degrees, so everywhere you turn, there's water glittering in the distance and salt perfuming the air.</p>

        <p>The cathedral's golden dome called to me first, as it has called to sailors for centuries. Construction began in 1722 and took 116 years with six different architects, so the building evolved from Baroque exuberance to Neoclassical restraint as it rose toward heaven. I climbed to the top, catching my breath on narrow stone stairs worn smooth by pilgrims and tourists, and emerged into 360-degree views that made my heart stop — the endless Atlantic stretching west toward the Americas, the white houses of the old town cascading down to turquoise water, fishing boats bobbing in the harbor where Columbus himself set sail on two voyages to the New World.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/cadiz/cadiz-1.webp" alt="Cadiz harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Cadiz — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Cadiz&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>After the cathedral, I wandered into the Barrio del Pópulo, the oldest neighborhood, where Roman foundations peek through medieval walls and laundry flaps from wrought-iron balconies like prayer flags. I stumbled upon the Roman Theatre from the 1st century BC — one of the largest in the entire Roman Empire, hidden beneath the neighborhood for centuries until excavators discovered it in 1980. Standing in those ancient stone seats, I could almost hear gladiators and senators echoing through time.</p>

        <p>The city has over 100 watchtowers scattered across its skyline, but Torre Tavira is the crown jewel. I climbed all 173 steps to the top of this mid-18th century watchtower where merchants once stood with telescopes, anxiously watching for their cargo ships coming home across the ocean. From that height, Cádiz spread below me like a pearl surrounded by sapphire — the peninsula so narrow I could see water on both sides.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon I descended into the Gadir Archaeological Site, where Phoenician settlement remains and an ancient necropolis whisper stories from 3,000 years ago. The museum is small but profound — pottery shards, burial vessels, the bones of a civilization that chose this exact spot to build a trading empire. Then I walked to Mercado Central, Spain's oldest covered market dating to the 1830s, where fishmongers still shout prices and the smell of fresh sardines mingles with ripe tomatoes and aged cheese.</p>

        <p>At noon I found myself at Playa de la Caleta, that crescent of sand between two ancient fortresses where locals swim in water so clear you can count the pebbles on the bottom. Fishermen mended nets in the shade while children splashed in the shallows. I had lunch nearby — tortillitas de camarones so crispy they shattered like glass, cazón en adobo that tasted like the ocean concentrated into tender bites, all washed down with cold manzanilla sherry that tasted of salt air and sunshine.</p>

        <p>Golden hour found me walking the sea wall as waves crashed against the stones and the entire city glowed amber behind me. The Atlantic stretched infinite and wild, and I understood why this place has been a crossroads for 3,000 years — it's the edge of the known world, the last solid ground before mystery begins. The pros of Cádiz are almost endless: authentic Andalusian soul with almost no cruise crowds, the port just a 5-10 minute walk from the city center, layer upon layer of genuine history, and food that makes you weep. The only con? Siesta hours close some shops, but honestly, the streets themselves are the attraction — wandering aimlessly through millennia is the point.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting atop the cathedral dome at sunset, the entire Atlantic before me turning molten orange, church bells ringing from a hundred directions across the peninsula, and realizing that Columbus stood on these same stones before sailing into the unknown — Cádiz felt like the edge of the world in the most beautiful, humbling way.

        <h3>Getting Around Cadiz</h3>
        <p>This is one of the rare gifts of Cádiz — your ship docks just 5-10 minutes' walk from the heart of the old city. Step off the gangway and within moments you're walking cobblestones that have felt Phoenician sandals, Roman boots, and Columbus's leather soles. The entire historic center is compact enough to explore on foot, a peninsula so slender you can walk from the Atlantic side to the bay side in fifteen minutes. No taxis needed, no shuttle buses, no complicated logistics — just your feet, your curiosity, and 3,000 years of history waiting around every corner.</p>

        <p>The old town is a labyrinth in the best way — narrow streets that twist and turn, opening suddenly onto sun-drenched plazas with orange trees and old men playing dominoes. I found myself delightfully lost half a dozen times, and each wrong turn revealed another watchtower, another hidden church, another tiny bar with sherry barrels stacked to the ceiling. The port area itself is beautiful, with palm trees swaying along the waterfront promenade. If you want to venture beyond the old town to beaches like Victoria or newer neighborhoods, local buses are cheap and frequent, but honestly, you could spend weeks in the historic quarter and never run out of wonders.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p>The Atlantic breeze keeps Cádiz cooler than inland Seville, but the Andalusian sun is still fierce — bring a hat, good walking shoes, and water. The city is wonderfully walkable, though those 173 steps up Torre Tavira and the cathedral climb will test your legs (trust me, they're worth every burning muscle). Many shops and restaurants close for siesta from about 2-5pm, but that's the perfect time to follow the locals' wisdom: find a shady plaza, order a cold caña, and watch the world slow down. The city is surrounded by water on three sides, so you're never far from a cooling sea breeze or a waterfront bench for resting your feet.</p>

        <p>English is less common here than in Barcelona or Madrid, so a few Spanish phrases go a long way and are received with warm smiles. The people of Cádiz are proud of their ancient city but wonderfully unpretentious — they're more interested in good conversation than tourist dollars. Cash is helpful for small purchases at the market or neighborhood bars, though most restaurants take cards. If you want to climb Torre Tavira or visit the Gadir Archaeological Site, there are small admission fees (usually just a few euros), but wandering the streets, soaking in the Roman theatre, and walking the sea walls costs nothing but time — and time, in Cádiz, feels abundant and sweet.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Cádiz worth visiting on a cruise stop?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely — it's the most underrated Spanish port I've encountered. While everyone flocks to Barcelona and Seville, Cádiz offers 3,000 years of authentic history, stunning Atlantic views, incredible food, and almost no cruise crowds. It's pure Andalusian magic without the tourist circus.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What are the must-see attractions?</strong><br/>A: The cathedral dome climb for 360-degree views, the Roman Theatre (one of the largest in the ancient empire), Torre Tavira watchtower with its 173 steps and panoramic vistas, the Gadir Archaeological Site for Phoenician history, Playa de la Caleta beach between the fortresses, and simply wandering the ancient Barrio del Pópulo. Don't miss Mercado Central, Spain's oldest covered market.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need to explore the old town?</strong><br/>A: You could easily spend a full day and still want more. The compact historic center means you can hit the major sites in 4-5 hours if pressed, but Cádiz rewards slow wandering — long lunches, cathedral roof contemplation, getting lost in medieval alleys. I'd give it your whole port day.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I walk from the cruise port to the city center?</strong><br/>A: Yes, and it's one of Cádiz's greatest gifts — the port is literally 5-10 minutes' walk from the old town. No taxis, no shuttles, no stress. You step off your ship and you're already in 3,000 years of history.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Cádiz where Columbus departed for America?</strong><br/>A: Yes! Columbus set sail from Cádiz on two of his voyages to the New World. Standing on the cathedral dome knowing he looked out at this same Atlantic horizon before sailing into the unknown is genuinely moving.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should I eat in Cádiz?</strong><br/>A: The seafood here is exceptional — try tortillitas de camarones (shrimp fritters), pescaito frito (fried fish), and cazón en adobo (marinated dogfish). Wash it down with cold manzanilla sherry. The fish comes straight from the boats to your plate, and you can taste the Atlantic in every bite.</p>

    <h3>Author's Note</h3>
    <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
      Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake. I've researched and written this guide with care — drawing on firsthand accounts, historical sources, and practical logistics — but I haven't yet walked these shores or felt the Atlantic wind that shapes Cádiz. When I do visit, I'll return to these pages and add the textures that only direct experience brings: the exact weight of sunlight on ancient stone, the particular taste of pescaito frito eaten steps from the harbor, the feeling of standing atop Torre Tavira where Columbus once gazed toward the unknown. Until then, consider this a chart drawn from trusted navigators, waiting for my own sextant reading to confirm its accuracy.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Cádiz is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Western Europe, founded by Phoenicians in 1100 BC. Walk straight from your ship into 3,000 years of history — golden cathedral dome, Roman theatre, Torre Tavira watchtower, Columbus's departure point, La Caleta beach, and the best pescaito frito in Andalucía. The port is literally 5-10 minutes' walk from the old town.
