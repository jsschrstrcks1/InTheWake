  "description": "<b>British Troops Distribute Food In Port Said.</b><br>British troops are seen 'besieged' by a crowd of clamorous Egyptians as they distribute food from a lorry to the native population of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Said\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Port Said\">Port Said</a>. One of the cordon of soldiers guarding the lorry seems to be discouraging an over-eager Egyptian from climbing on board. Port Said, at the northern end of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Suez Canal\">Suez Canal</a>, is now under the control of the Anglo-French military forces.",
