It's been refurbished, but don't expect cutting-edge tech or newest venues. Cabins are smaller. Dining variety is limited. The pool deck is functional, not Instagram-worthy.\n\nBut if you want *cruising*\u2014not theme-parking at sea\u2014Vision delivers. Attentive crew who remember your name. Traditional dining room with proper service. Manageable size where you can find the library, spa, or your cabin without a map. The signature glass-wall design provides panoramic ocean views.\n\nVision is the ship you choose when you understand what it's trying to be: a floating hotel for beautiful ports, designed for travelers who'd rather explore Alaska's glaciers than ride a surf simulator.\n\nSee [other Vision-class ships](/ships.html) for similar intimate experiences, or compare to [Radiance class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) for glass-wall design in a slightly larger package.",

      "markdown": "**Some cruise memories are about activities. Some are about moments. The Viking Crown Lounge gave us both.**\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge sits at the top of Vision of the Seas \u2014 a circular, glass-walled space that wraps around the ship's smokestack. Floor-to-ceiling windows. 360-degree views. During the day, it's a quiet bar. At night, it becomes something else.\n\nOur second evening at sea, we went up around 6pm for a drink before dinner. The sun was setting. The ocean was calm. The lounge was nearly empty \u2014 maybe six other people in a space that seats fifty.\n\nWe took a table by the windows. Ordered wine. Watched the sun sink into the Caribbean, turning the water gold, then pink, then purple. No music. No announcements. No distractions. Just us, the ocean, and the sunset.\n\nMy wife took my hand. We didn't say anything for ten minutes. Didn't need to.\n\nWe went back every evening for the rest of the cruise. Same time. Same table when we could get it. Some nights were clear and spectacular. Some were cloudy and moody. One night it rained and we watched storm clouds roll across the horizon while lightning flickered in the distance.\n\nEvery night was perfect.\n\n**Why it works:** The Viking Crown Lounge is Vision Class's signature feature \u2014 all four ships have it ([Grandeur](/ships/rcl/grandeur-of-the-seas.html), [Rhapsody](/ships/rcl/rhapsody-of-the-seas.html), [Enchantment](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html), Vision). It's high enough to feel removed from the crowds. Glass walls mean unobstructed views in every direction. And because it's not heavily promoted, most guests don't know about it.\n\nGo at sunset. Skip the formal dining rush. Bring someone you want to be quiet with. Order a drink and watch the world turn.\n\nThis is what cruising should be: not packed pools and waterslides, but moments like this. Quiet. Beautiful. Together.\n\nSee our [romantic cruise guide](/planning.html) and [couple's travel tips](/articles.html).",

      "title": "Traditional Dining Done Right",
      "persona_label": "Classic Cruising Experience",
      "intended_reader": "Travelers who prefer structured traditional dining over flexible modern options",
      "core_insight": "Vision Class ships maintain classic cruise dining traditions that newer ships have moved away from",
      "markdown": "**We requested traditional dining. Same table, same servers, same time every night. The host looked at us like we'd asked for something weird.**\n\nMost Royal Caribbean ships now push \"My Time Dining\" \u2014 flexible seating, different servers every night, dine whenever you want. It's convenient. It's modern. It's also lonely.\n\nWe're old-fashioned. We wanted traditional: assigned table, assigned server, assigned time. Dinner at 6pm every night. Same faces. Same conversations. The way cruising used to be.\n\nVision of the Seas still does this beautifully.\n\nOur server was Antonio. Our assistant server was Marco. Our table was for four (just us and one other couple). Every night at 6pm for seven nights.\n\nBy night two, Antonio remembered we liked sparkling water, my wife ordered decaf coffee, and I always wanted the bread basket refilled. By night three, he was making recommendations based on what we'd enjoyed before. By night five, he was telling us about his family in the Philippines and we were sharing photos of our grandkids.\n\nThe other couple at our table \u2014 retired teachers from Oregon \u2014 became friends. We ate together every night, progressing from polite small talk to genuine conversations about life, travel, books, politics (carefully), and what we'd do differently if we could do it all again.\n\nOn the last night, we exchanged emails. We've stayed in touch. We're planning a land vacation together next year.\n\nThat doesn't happen with My Time Dining. You can't build rapport with different servers every night. You can't form connections with different tablemates every meal. The convenience comes at the cost of community.\n\n**What makes it work on Vision:** Smaller ship (2,000 guests) means the dining room isn't overwhelming. Two seatings (6pm and 8:30pm) give options without chaos. The crew is trained in traditional service \u2014 pacing, timing, attentiveness. And because the ship attracts guests who appreciate classic cruising, you're more likely to meet like-minded people.\n\nIf you miss the way cruising used to be \u2014 when it was about people, not just ports \u2014 choose a Vision Class ship and request traditional dining. You'll remember your server's name. You might even remember your tablemates twenty years from now.\n\nSee our [dining guide](/restaurants.html) and [classic cruising tips](/articles.html).",

      "markdown": "**I've sailed ships with 6,000 guests. I've done river cruises with 150. Vision's 2,000 feels just right.**\n\nMega-ships are impressive. [Oasis Class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), [Icon Class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) \u2014 they're floating cities with every amenity imaginable. But they're also overwhelming. Lines for everything. Crowds at pools. Elevators that take ten minutes because they stop at every deck. You see thousands of faces and never the same one twice.\n\nSmall luxury ships are intimate. You know everyone by name. Service is impeccable. But options are limited. One dining room. One lounge. One pool. You can get bored by day three.\n\nVision of the Seas is the Goldilocks ship: not too big, not too small, just right.\n\n**What 2,000 passengers means:**\n- You recognize faces but aren't forced into awkward repeated small talk\n- Dining room has variety but you can get to know your server\n- Pool deck is busy but you can find a chair without warfare\n- Shows and activities have crowds but feel communal, not anonymous\n- Elevators and hallways are navigable without strategic planning\n- Crew remembers you if you want them to, but you're not on display\n\nI'm an introvert. Mega-ships exhaust me. River cruises trap me. Vision gives me space to be alone when I want and community when I need it.\n\nMy wife is an extrovert. She needs variety and activity. Vision has enough restaurants, bars, shows, and activities to keep her interested without overwhelming her with choices.\n\nWe both loved it. That's rare.\n\n**Vision Class sweet spots:**\n- Couples who want options without chaos\n- Solo travelers who want social opportunities without forced interaction\n- Seniors who want manageable size without sacrificing amenities\n- First-time cruisers who aren't ready for mega-ships\n- Experienced cruisers who miss when ships felt human-scaled\n\nSize matters in cruising. Bigger isn't always better. Sometimes right-sized is perfect.\n\nCompare to other mid-sized ships: [Radiance Class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) (2,100 guests), [Voyager Class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) (3,100 guests).",
