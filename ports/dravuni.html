          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The tender swung toward shore through water so clear I could count the fish below us, and then I saw Dravuni Island rise from the Pacific like something from a dream that hadn't yet learned cynicism existed. Maybe thirty thatched bures dotted the volcanic hillside above a crescent beach that practically glowed against the turquoise lagoon. No roads, no power lines, no shops—just a village of roughly one hundred people living as their great-grandparents had lived, preparing to welcome a ship full of strangers with songs and smiles that would test everything I thought I knew about "authentic experiences" being marketing fiction.</p>

            <p>We waded ashore through knee-deep water, holding our sandals overhead, and the village children ran to meet us like we were long-lost relatives finally come home. Their laughter echoed across the beach as they splashed alongside the tenders, calling out "bula!" with such genuine enthusiasm that my heart caught unexpectedly. My wife squeezed my hand as we stepped onto the coral sand—this wasn't a show. This was Tuesday morning in Dravuni, and we were about to discover what hospitality looked like when it wasn't manufactured for profit.</p>

            <p>The kava ceremony began in the shade of a massive banyan tree, village elders seated cross-legged around a tanoa bowl so ancient it seemed carved from sacred wood. The chief spoke in Fijian while a young man translated, explaining that yaqona was their way of welcoming guests into the community—a ritual older than anyone could remember, practiced exactly as ancestors had practiced it. The sound of pounding filled the air as dried kava root became powder, mixed with water, strained through cloth, the earthy liquid collecting in the communal bowl. When the bilo—coconut shell cup—came to me, the protocol was clear: clap once, say "bula," drink it all in one gulp, clap three times. The kava tasted like muddy water strained through roots, numbing lips slightly. Everyone smiled when the cup emptied. Family now.</p>

            <p>An elder woman named Mere found the wandering visitor near the village church and took my hand without asking, leading the way to woven mats where other women sat working. Through gestures and broken English and patient repetition, she taught the palm frond pattern she'd known since childhood—a small fish shape that seemed so simple when her fingers moved and so impossible when clumsy foreign fingers fumbled the same motions. Her great-grandchildren played at our feet, unbothered by cameras or schedules or the ship waiting in the harbor. The weaving kept failing. She kept laughing, patting my hand with grandmotherly affection that crossed every boundary language could construct.</p>

            <p>When the time came to leave, Mere pressed something into my palm—a perfectly woven fish, the one she'd made while teaching me, given without expectation of anything in return. I looked at this small thing, this gift of time and skill and patience from a woman who had nothing to sell me and wanted nothing except that I carry a piece of her work into the wider world. Tears came before I could stop them, streaming down my face as I embraced this grandmother who shared no common language with me but understood something essential about human connection. My wife found us there, both of us crying now, Mere patting my back and saying words I couldn't translate but didn't need to.</p>

            <p>We snorkeled off the northern beach later, floating over coral gardens where parrotfish and angelfish moved through colors that shouldn't exist in nature. A sea turtle glided past, unbothered by our presence, ancient and graceful and owning these waters entirely. The reef showed scars of bleaching—climate change doesn't spare small islands—but life persisted in brilliant defiance. I floated face-down watching that turtle until my wife tugged my fin to point toward shore, where villagers were gathering to sing farewell to the departing tenders. Their voices carried across the lagoon, harmonies that had echoed off this same beach for generations, a gift given freely to strangers who had arrived that morning and would leave with something precious that couldn't be purchased.</p>

            <p>I climbed to the summit cross before the last tender—fifteen minutes of steep trail through jungle heat that left me breathless but rewarded with 360-degree views of the Kadavu Group. Islands floated on the horizon in every direction, the ship tiny in the anchorage below, the village a cluster of thatch roofs amid palm trees. From here I could see the entire world of Dravuni's hundred souls—their church, their school, their fishing boats, their lives bounded by water and sustained by community. I stood there feeling grateful for being allowed to witness it, even briefly, even as an outsider who would sail away within the hour.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Mere's woven fish sits in my travel bag still. Taking it out sometimes, turning the palm fronds between my fingers, feeling their texture while remembering a grandmother who gave a stranger her morning's work simply because we sat together. Looking back, Dravuni taught lessons about generosity that transcend language, about wealth having nothing to do with money, about places that haven't learned to be cynical when welcoming the world with open hearts. The fish reminds me to be worthy of that welcome.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Dravuni Island is a tiny volcanic island in Fiji's remote Kadavu Group, home to approximately one hundred residents living in a single village without roads, shops, or commercial infrastructure. Ships anchor offshore and tender passengers directly to the coral sand beach—there is no dock or terminal. The tender ride takes 5-10 minutes through crystal-clear lagoon waters, often requiring passengers to wade through shallow water to reach shore. This is not a polished cruise port but an authentic village welcoming visitors into daily island life.</p>

            <p>The village occupies the hillside above the northern beach, thatched bures visible from the anchorage. A white cross marks the summit of the volcanic peak—the island's highest point, accessible via a short but steep trail. The church serves as the community's spiritual center; the beach serves as its living room. Cruise visitors are welcomed with kava ceremonies, village tours, and genuine Fijian hospitality that predates tourism and continues regardless of ship schedules. Come prepared for simplicity—there is nothing to buy except handmade crafts, nothing to do except connect with people and place.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> The beach and village require minimal walking on flat sand and packed dirt paths. The summit trail demands moderate fitness—15-20 minutes of steep climbing in tropical heat. Snorkeling requires swimming ability. Wheelchair users face significant barriers: tender landing requires stepping into shallow water, beach is soft sand, village paths are unpaved, and no accessible facilities exist. Those with mobility limitations should assess personal capability honestly; the island lacks any infrastructure for assistance.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Walking is the only option:</strong> Dravuni has no vehicles, no roads, and no transportation infrastructure. The entire island can be walked in thirty minutes. Tender landing to village center takes five minutes on foot along the beach and dirt paths. Terrain includes soft sand, packed dirt, and rocky areas near the summit trail. Wear comfortable shoes that can get wet during tender landing—remove them for village visits and the church. Reef shoes prove useful for rocky beach sections and snorkeling entry.</p>

            <p><strong>Key landmarks:</strong> The tender lands on the northern beach, which curves around the island's edge. The village sits on the hillside above, accessed by a gentle uphill path. The Methodist church—a focal point for community life—stands near the village center. The summit trail begins behind the village, climbing steeply to the white cross with panoramic views. Coral reefs for snorkeling lie just offshore along the northern beach, accessible by swimming 30-50 meters from shore.</p>

            <p><strong>Guided tours:</strong> Most cruise lines organize group tours led by village residents. These typically include the kava ceremony, village walk, and cultural demonstrations. Tours cost $40-60 per person through ship excursions or can be arranged informally with village guides ($10-20 cash tip appreciated). <strong>Independent</strong> exploration is welcome—villagers are extraordinarily friendly and will often invite conversation or demonstration without any tour structure. Respect local customs: remove shoes before entering homes or church, dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered), ask permission before taking portraits.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility considerations:</strong> This destination presents serious accessibility challenges. Tender boarding requires stepping down into a small boat, potentially in rough water. Beach landing may require wading through ankle-to-knee-deep water onto soft sand. No paved paths, ramps, or accessible facilities exist anywhere on the island. Wheelchair users cannot access the village without assistance on sand and dirt paths. The island lacks medical facilities, accessible restrooms, or any infrastructure for mobility assistance. Guests should honestly assess their capabilities before tendering ashore.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Dravuni excursions focus on community and nature rather than activities or attractions. <strong>Ship excursion</strong> packages typically bundle the kava ceremony, village tour, and beach time into organized half-day experiences with <strong>guaranteed return</strong> timing. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration works equally well—villagers welcome respectful visitors throughout the island. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through your cruise line if you prefer structured guidance, or simply tender ashore and follow the welcome.</p>

            <h3>Kava Ceremony Welcome</h3>
            <p>The island's signature experience—a traditional yaqona ceremony performed by village elders beneath the ancient banyan tree. The chief explains customs and island lineage while kava is prepared in the communal tanoa bowl. When offered the bilo (coconut shell), protocol requires: clap once, say "bula," drink the contents in one gulp, clap three times. The earthy, slightly numbing liquid tastes like muddy water but drinking it honors centuries of Pacific hospitality. Usually included in ship excursions ($40-60) or arranged informally upon arrival. Duration 20-30 minutes. All visitors participate; declining the bilo would be insulting. Accessible for seated participation—ceremonies held at ground level on woven mats.</p>

            <h3>Village Tour</h3>
            <p>Walk through the village with local guides who share daily life—earth oven cooking demonstrations, palm frond weaving, fishing techniques, medicinal plants. Visit the church (remove shoes, modest dress required). Children often perform songs. No staged performances—genuine glimpses into subsistence living. Villagers extraordinarily friendly; expect invitations to try weaving or ask questions. Ship excursions include village tours ($40-60); independent visitors often receive informal tours from curious residents. Allow 1-2 hours for meaningful exchanges. Moderate stamina on hillside paths. Village paths unpaved; wheelchairs cannot navigate independently.</p>

            <h3>Beach Time and Swimming</h3>
            <p>Pristine coral sand beach wraps the northern shore—warm, crystal-clear water shallow enough to wade for 50+ meters. Perfect for swimming, floating, shell collecting, or simply being present in paradise. Shade limited (palm trees offer some respite); bring hat and reef-safe sunscreen. No beach chairs or amenities—bring what you need from ship. Free and fully <strong>independent</strong>. Allow 1-2 hours minimum. Low stamina. Beach accessible but soft sand challenges wheelchairs; water entry requires walking on sand and wading.</p>

            <h3>Snorkeling the Reef</h3>
            <p>Healthy coral formations lie offshore along the northern beach—swim out 30-50 meters to reach reef drop-offs. Tropical fish abundant: parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, occasional sea turtles. Visibility typically excellent in calm conditions. Coral shows some bleaching scars but remains colorful and alive. Bring your own gear or rent through ship excursions ($15-25). Ship excursions often include guided snorkel trips ($50-80). <strong>Independent</strong> snorkeling equally rewarding—simply swim from beach. Allow 30-60 minutes. Moderate stamina for swimming. Reef shoes recommended for rocky entry points. Not accessible for non-swimmers.</p>

            <h3>Summit Hike</h3>
            <p>Short but steep trail climbs to the white cross atop the volcanic cone—360-degree panoramic views of the Kadavu Group, surrounding reefs, and your ship in the anchorage below. Trail informal (follow the path, watch footing on roots and rocks). Elevation gain moderate but tropical heat intensifies the challenge. Allow 15-20 minutes ascending, 10-15 descending. Bring water. Wear closed-toe shoes. Best early morning or late afternoon for cooler temperatures. High stamina required. <strong>Independent</strong> only; no guided summit tours. Not accessible for mobility limitations—steep, uneven terrain throughout.</p>

            <h3>Handicraft Purchases</h3>
            <p>Village women display handwoven baskets, mats, fans, and shell jewelry on blankets near the tender landing. Prices modest ($5-30 FJD / $2-13 USD); purchases support families directly without middlemen. Quality varies but authenticity guaranteed. Woven palm fish, tapa cloth samples, shell necklaces make perfect souvenirs with stories attached. Bring small Fijian bills or USD cash—no credit cards, no ATMs, limited change available. Allow 15-30 minutes browsing. Low stamina. <strong>Independent</strong> activity. Accessible—crafts displayed at beach level near tender landing.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Kava ritual:</strong> Yaqona ceremonies predate written Fijian memory—archaeological evidence suggests kava use throughout the Pacific for at least 3,000 years. The preparation method (pounding roots, straining through cloth, communal drinking from a single bowl) has remained essentially unchanged. Kava's mild sedative properties create relaxation and social bonding; Fijians consider sharing kava essential to community life. Participating in a village ceremony connects you to unbroken ritual reaching back millennia.</p>

            <p><strong>Kadavu Group geography:</strong> Dravuni belongs to Fiji's Kadavu Group—volcanic islands south of Viti Levu, surrounded by the Great Astrolabe Reef, one of the world's largest barrier reefs. The waters here support exceptional marine biodiversity despite isolation and limited tourism. Dravuni itself measures roughly half a mile across, its volcanic peak rising steeply from the lagoon. No scheduled transportation connects the island to larger Fiji; villagers rely on occasional supply boats and visiting ships.</p>

            <p><strong>Methodist faith:</strong> Christianity arrived in Fiji with missionaries in the 1830s; today 65% of Fijians identify as Methodist. The village church on Dravuni serves as community center and spiritual anchor. Sunday services bring the entire village together; visitors during Sunday calls can observe this practice. Fijian Christianity blends Western theology with Pacific family values—faith, community, and hospitality interweave in ways visitors often find moving regardless of their own beliefs.</p>

            <p><strong>Subsistence living:</strong> Dravuni's residents live largely as their great-grandparents did—fishing the reef, growing taro and cassava, raising pigs and chickens, weaving mats for sleeping and ceremony. No electricity grid serves the island; some solar panels provide limited power. Fresh water comes from rainfall collection. This isn't poverty tourism but genuine glimpse at sustainable living practiced for generations. The village operates because its systems work, not because residents lack options.</p>

              <summary>Is the snorkeling good at Dravuni?</summary>
              <p>Yes—excellent for a small island. Coral reefs lie 30-50 meters offshore from the northern beach with typically clear visibility. Expect parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, and occasional sea turtles. Coral shows some bleaching but remains colorful. Bring your own gear or rent through ship excursions ($15-25). Reef shoes recommended for rocky entry.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I explore the village independently?</summary>
              <p>Yes—villagers welcome respectful independent visitors. Most cruise lines offer guided tours ($40-60) but wandering freely works equally well. Remove shoes before entering homes or the church. Dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered). Ask permission before photographing people. Bringing small gifts (school supplies, packaged food) is appreciated but not required.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How much time should I plan for Dravuni?</summary>
              <p>Most cruise visits allow 3-4 hours—enough for the kava ceremony, village tour, beach time, and either snorkeling or the summit hike. The island is tiny; you can walk its perimeter in 30 minutes. This is a half-day experience focused on authentic community connection and natural beauty, not activities or shopping.</p>
