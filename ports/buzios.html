          <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>The tender bounced across the emerald water, and I caught my first glimpse of Búzios – a cluster of terracotta rooftops tumbling down hillsides toward a bay dotted with colorful fishing boats. Brazil's most glamorous beach destination announced itself immediately: this was no ordinary cruise port. Armação dos Búzios, to use its full name, occupies a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic about three hours east of Rio de Janeiro. Twenty-three beaches wrap around its shores, each with its own character, from wild surf to calm coves perfect for families. The cruise ship anchored in the bay while we tendered to the main pier, a process that took perhaps fifteen minutes and deposited us directly into the heart of this enchanting town.</p>

            <p>Búzios owes its fame partly to Brigitte Bardot, who visited in 1964 and transformed a sleepy fishing village into an international destination. Her bronze statue still sits on the waterfront, a selfie magnet for tourists. But the town has grown far beyond one celebrity's endorsement. I wandered along Rua das Pedras, the famous cobblestone pedestrian street lined with boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants. The buildings paint themselves in tropical colors – coral pink, ocean blue, sunny yellow – and bougainvillea cascades from balconies. The atmosphere felt distinctly Mediterranean, yet unmistakably Brazilian. Music drifted from open doorways. The scent of grilled seafood mixed with tropical flowers. I found myself slowing down, matching the unhurried rhythm of this seaside paradise.</p>

            <p>However elegant the town center appears, the beaches remain Búzios's essential attraction. I hired a taxi boat from the main pier – about R$40 ($8) for a circuit of several beaches – and spent the morning hopping between coves. Praia da Ferradura (Horseshoe Beach) lived up to its name, a perfect crescent of calm turquoise water ideal for swimming. Praia João Fernandes offered excellent snorkeling; I rented gear for R$30 ($6) and spotted colorful fish among the rocks. Praia Geribá attracted surfers with its larger waves. Though each beach has its personality, they share certain qualities: clean sand, clear water, and that particular Brazilian beach culture of vendors selling caipirinhas and grilled cheese on sticks. I bought a fresh coconut for R$10 ($2) and drank the water through a straw while my feet disappeared into warm sand.</p>

            <p>What surprised me most about Búzios was its accessibility despite the glamorous reputation. Yes, upscale restaurants and boutique hotels dot the peninsula, but budget travelers find plenty of options. Street vendors sell espetinhos (meat skewers) for R$15 ($3). Simple beachfront restaurants offer generous seafood plates for R$60-80 ($12-16). The taxi boats provide affordable beach-hopping. And the beaches themselves are free – no entrance fees, no reservations required. I spent perhaps R$200 ($40) for an entire day including transportation, snorkeling, lunch, and drinks. Compared to Caribbean beach destinations, Búzios offers remarkable value while delivering comparable beauty and better food.</p>

            <p>The tender port logistics deserve mention for cruise visitors. Ships anchor in the bay and tender passengers to the main pier in Armação, the central village. From there, everything is walkable – Rua das Pedras, the waterfront promenade, the Bardot statue, dozens of restaurants and boutiques. Beaches require either taxi boats or regular taxis depending on distance. Praia da Armação and Praia dos Ossos lie within walking distance; more distant beaches like Geribá or Ferradura need transportation. Portuguese is the primary language, though tourist-facing businesses generally speak some English. The Brazilian real fluctuates, but expect roughly 5 BRL to 1 USD. Cash is preferred at smaller vendors; credit cards work at established restaurants and larger vendors.</p>

            <p>By afternoon, I had found my favorite spot – a beach chair at Praia Azeda, reachable by a short trail from Praia dos Ossos. The crowd thinned here; families splashed in shallow water while I sipped a caipirinha made with fresh lime and cachaça. The tender schedule allowed plenty of time for exploration, and I returned to the pier with an hour to spare, my skin sun-kissed and my heart full. Búzios had delivered exactly what Brazil promises – natural beauty, warmth (both climate and people), infectious energy, and that particular Brazilian gift for making strangers feel welcome. As my tender pulled away from shore, I found myself already planning a return visit, perhaps by land next time to explore more of those twenty-three beaches at leisure. The sunset painted the hills in shades of coral and gold, a fitting farewell from this Brazilian paradise that had exceeded every expectation I had carried ashore that morning. We had found magic in simplicity – warm water, friendly faces, delicious food, and that intangible Brazilian spirit that makes visitors feel less like tourists and more like welcomed guests. This was not just another beach destination; this was Búzios, a place that understands the art of living well and generously shares that wisdom with everyone who arrives by tender or by road.</p>

            <p>Búzios is a tender port – ships anchor in the sheltered bay and tender passengers to the main pier in Armação, the central village area. The tender ride takes 10-15 minutes depending on sea conditions. The pier deposits you directly into the heart of town, steps from Rua das Pedras and the waterfront promenade. There is no formal cruise terminal building; you simply walk off the tender onto the pier and into the village. Tourist information is available informally through local guides at the pier. Restrooms and ATMs can be found along Rua das Pedras. The tender location makes Búzios one of the more convenient tender ports – no long walks or shuttle buses required, just immediate access to the town center. Taxi boats and regular taxis wait near the pier for beach transportation. Ships typically allow 6-8 hours in port, adequate for beach-hopping and exploring the village.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>The central village of Armação is entirely walkable once you tender ashore. Rua das Pedras, the main pedestrian street, stretches about 500 meters with boutiques, restaurants, and galleries. The waterfront promenade connects several nearby beaches within walking distance including Praia dos Ossos and Praia da Armação.</p>
            <p><strong>Taxi Boats:</strong> The quintessential Búzios experience. Small motorboats depart from the main pier and circuit multiple beaches, dropping passengers at any requested stop. Expect R$30-50 ($6-10) per person for a multi-beach circuit. Negotiate price before boarding. These boats make beach-hopping easy and scenic.</p>
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Regular taxis wait near the tender pier. Fares to more distant beaches (Geribá, Ferradura) run R$40-70 ($8-14) each way. Agree on price before departure. Some drivers offer hourly rates for beach exploration.</p>
            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Praia Azeda requires a short trail walk from Praia dos Ossos. Other beaches are too far to walk comfortably given limited port time.</p>
            <p>Accessibility note: The cobblestone streets of Rua das Pedras present challenges for wheelchairs and those with mobility limitations. The tender pier has no accessibility equipment; boarding requires stepping up and down. Beaches have sand access only – no boardwalks or wheelchair paths. Ship excursion desks can advise on accessible options, but Búzios is better suited to those comfortable with uneven surfaces and stairs.</p>

          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Búzios has 23 beaches around its peninsula. These are the most popular for cruise visitors:</p>
            <p><strong>Praia da Ferradura (Horseshoe Beach):</strong> Calm, shallow waters perfect for swimming and families. The horseshoe shape creates a protected cove. Beach chairs and umbrellas available for rent. Accessible by taxi or taxi boat (R$40/$8 from pier).</p>
            <p><strong>Praia João Fernandes:</strong> Popular for snorkeling with clear water and rocky outcrops. Rental snorkel gear available (R$30/$6). Beachfront restaurants serve fresh seafood. Can get crowded on cruise days. Taxi boat access recommended.</p>
            <p><strong>Praia Geribá:</strong> The surfer's beach with consistent waves. Wider and more exposed than other Búzios beaches. Young, energetic crowd. About 15 minutes by taxi from the pier (R$50/$10).</p>
            <p><strong>Praia Azeda:</strong> Small, picturesque cove reached by a short trail from Praia dos Ossos. Less crowded, more intimate atmosphere. Crystal-clear water for swimming. No facilities – bring water and snacks.</p>
            <p><strong>Praia dos Ossos:</strong> Walking distance from the tender pier (10 minutes). Small beach with fishing boats and local atmosphere. The trail to Praia Azeda starts here.</p>
            <p><strong>Praia da Armação:</strong> The closest beach to the tender pier, immediately adjacent to town. Convenient but often crowded. Good for a quick swim between restaurant visits.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p><strong>Beach-Hopping by Taxi Boat:</strong> The signature Búzios experience. Hire a taxi boat from the main pier for a circuit of 3-5 beaches. Most boats accommodate 6-10 passengers; prices run R$30-50 per person ($6-10) for a 2-3 hour circuit. Boats wait at each beach for agreed pickup times. Book ahead through your ship's excursion desk for guaranteed return times, or negotiate independently at the pier for flexibility and lower prices. Independent booking works well here – just agree on beaches and pickup times with your captain.</p>

            <p><strong>Snorkeling at João Fernandes:</strong> Clear waters and rocky formations make this the best snorkeling beach. Rent gear at beachfront stands (R$30/$6). Ship excursions include transportation and equipment ($50-70 per person). Independent visitors take taxi boats and rent locally for significant savings. Water clarity is best in morning before crowds arrive. Book ahead during peak season (December-February).</p>

            <p><strong>Rua das Pedras Walking Tour:</strong> Self-guided exploration of the famous cobblestone street. Boutiques, galleries, restaurants, and the Brigitte Bardot statue. No booking required – simply walk from the tender pier. Allow 1-2 hours for browsing. Ship excursions may include guided walks with local commentary ($30-40), but independent exploration is equally rewarding and free.</p>

            <p><strong>Trolley Tour:</strong> Colorful open-air trolleys circuit the peninsula with stops at scenic viewpoints and beaches. About R$60 ($12) per person for a 1.5-hour loop. Departs near the tender pier. Good for photography and overview, though limited beach time. Book ahead during busy cruise days.</p>

            <p><strong>Scuba Diving:</strong> Several operators offer introductory dives for beginners and boat dives for certified divers. Water visibility often exceeds 15 meters. Expect R$350-500 ($70-100) for a two-tank dive. Book ahead through dive operators or ship excursion desk. Allow 3-4 hours for a complete diving experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Independent vs. Ship Excursions:</strong> Búzios rewards independent exploration due to its compact size and walkability from the tender pier. Taxi boats are plentiful and affordable. However, ship excursions guarantee return times – important in a tender port where missing the last tender means expensive water taxi arrangements or hotel stays. For beach-hopping and town exploration, independent travel offers better value and flexibility. For longer excursions to distant beaches, ship-organized tours provide peace of mind. The key advantage of booking through your ship's excursion desk is the guaranteed return to your vessel, even if traffic or weather delays occur. Independent travelers should always allow extra time for returning to the tender pier and have contingency plans for water taxis if needed.</p>

            <p><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Búzios excels at simply prepared fish and shellfish. Moqueca (coconut milk fish stew) and grilled whole fish are local specialties. Beachfront restaurants at João Fernandes and Ferradura offer catch-of-the-day options (R$80-120/$16-24 per plate).</p>
            <p><strong>Caipirinha:</strong> Brazil's national cocktail – fresh lime muddled with sugar and cachaça (sugarcane spirit). Beach vendors make them fresh (R$15-25/$3-5). Try variations with passion fruit (maracujá) or kiwi.</p>
            <p><strong>Street Food:</strong> Espetinhos (meat skewers) from vendors along Rua das Pedras (R$15/$3). Queijo coalho (grilled cheese on a stick) sold by beach vendors. Açaí bowls for an energy boost (R$20-30/$4-6).</p>
            <p><strong>Restaurants on Rua das Pedras:</strong> Upscale options line the main street. Expect R$100-200 ($20-40) per person for a full meal with drinks. Reservations recommended for dinner; lunch is more casual.</p>
            <p><strong>Budget Options:</strong> Self-service restaurants (per-kilo buffets) offer substantial meals for R$40-60 ($8-12). Look for "comida por quilo" signs. Beach vendors sell sandwiches, empanadas, and fresh fruit.</p>

            <p>Búzios offers a remarkably civilized tender port experience. The sheltered bay typically allows smooth tender operations, and the short ride deposits visitors directly into a charming walkable village. Unlike many tender ports requiring shuttles or long walks, here you step off the tender and immediately begin exploring. Portuguese is the primary language, but tourism has been central to Búzios for decades, so basic English is common in restaurants and stores. Crime is not a major concern in the tourist areas, though standard precautions apply – don't flash expensive jewelry or leave bags unattended on beaches.</p>

            <p>The economy runs on tourism, and cruise visitors are welcomed with genuine warmth. Tipping is not obligatory in Brazil but is appreciated – 10% at restaurants is customary. Taxi and taxi boat drivers expect tips for good service. The Brazilian real fluctuates; check current exchange rates before your visit. ATMs dispense reais; international cards work at most machines but may incur fees. Credit cards are accepted at established businesses but beach vendors and small operators prefer cash.</p>

            <p>Medical facilities are limited in Búzios itself; serious emergencies would require transfer to Cabo Frio or Rio de Janeiro. Travel insurance with medical evacuation coverage is recommended. Cell service is reliable in the village; coverage weakens at more remote beaches. WiFi is available at most restaurants. Water quality is good, but bottled water is recommended and widely available. The climate is tropical with warm temperatures year-round; December through February is peak summer with occasional rain showers that pass quickly. Wheelchair accessibility is limited due to cobblestones and sandy beaches – those with mobility concerns should discuss options with the ship's excursion desk before booking.</p>
