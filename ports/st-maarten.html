          <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> St. Maarten is a dual-nation island with Maho Beach jet-blast plane spotting on the Dutch side and Orient Beach rosé on the French side — two countries, one perfect day.
        </p>

        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>The approach to St. Maarten is pure Caribbean theater. Our ship threads between green volcanic hills while, on the Dutch side, a 747 descends so low over Maho Beach that I can practically read the tail number. Passengers line the rails pointing and gasping. It doesn't matter how many times I've sailed here — that first glimpse of a jumbo jet skimming the sand never gets old.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/st-maarten/st-maarten-1.webp" alt="St. Maarten harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>St. Maarten — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=St%20Maarten&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

          <p>We dock at the <strong>Dr. A.C. Wathey Pier</strong> in Philipsburg, the Dutch capital. Within two minutes of walking off the gangway, I'm through the modest terminal and onto the boardwalk. Philipsburg stretches along a narrow strip of land between the harbor and Great Bay, and Front Street is already buzzing with jewelry shops, electronics dealers, and rum cake vendors calling out samples. It's touristy, sure, but in that cheerful, duty-free kind of way.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Lying on Orient Beach with a cold Carib in hand, hearing French on one side and Dutch patois on the other, realizing one tiny island holds two completely different countries in perfect harmony. No border guards. No passport stamps. Just a modest obelisk marking where one nation ends and another begins.
          </div>

          <p>My morning ritual is simple: water taxi to the east end of Philipsburg (all-day pass is a steal), then a shared taxi to <strong>Maho Beach</strong>. This is where Princess Juliana International Airport's runway — originally built by the U.S. Army during World War II for submarine patrol flights — ends literally at the sand. The iconic Sunset Beach Bar anchors the scene, and by 10 a.m., the crowd is already building. Someone checks the flight tracker app. "KLM 747 in twenty minutes!" The anticipation builds until that massive aircraft appears over the water, engines roaring, gear down, descending to barely 100 feet overhead — close enough that you instinctively duck. The jet blast from takeoffs is even more intense — signs warn of injuries, and they mean it. I've seen tourists blow across the sand like tumbleweeds.</p>

          <p>But St. Maarten isn't just about planes. By noon, I'm in a taxi crossing the invisible border to the French side — <strong>Saint Martin</strong> (yes, the spelling changes). The vibe shifts immediately. Suddenly it's rosé with lunch, pain au chocolat from proper patisseries, and topless sunbathing at <strong>Orient Beach</strong>. I rent a lounger at Kakao Beach Club, order grilled lobster and a carafe of chilled rosé, and spend hours floating in that impossible turquoise water. The French waitstaff bring Ti' punch (rum, lime, cane sugar) and I lose all track of time.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

          <p>Late afternoon, I catch a taxi to <strong>Marigot</strong>, the French capital. The market is winding down but the waterfront is coming alive. I browse duty-free boutiques (French perfumes and liquors are notably cheaper here), grab an espresso, and watch the fishing boats return. It's all very Mediterranean-on-the-Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Back on the Dutch side by sunset, I stop at the <strong>Guavaberry Emporium</strong> on Front Street. Guavaberry is the island's signature liqueur — tangy, slightly spicy, nothing like regular guava. I buy a couple bottles for gifts and one for me. The walk back to the ship as the sun sets behind the hills, with planes still landing in the golden light, is one of my favorite port-day endings anywhere.</p>

          <h3>One Island, Two Nations: Understanding the Split</h3>
          <p>St. Maarten holds a unique distinction — it's the smallest inhabited island on Earth shared between two sovereign nations. Just 37 square miles of volcanic rock and white sand (the French side claims 53 square kilometers while the Dutch control 34 square kilometers), yet somehow this tiny speck in the Caribbean manages to accommodate 47 different nationalities, over 400 restaurants, and two completely separate governments existing in remarkable harmony. The southern portion, Sint Maarten, belongs to the Kingdom of the Netherlands with its capital in Philipsburg where cruise ships dock. The northern section, Saint Martin, is an overseas collectivity of France with Marigot serving as its administrative center.</p>

          <p>Long before European flags flew over these hills, Amerindian peoples called this island home. Christopher Columbus first sighted the island on November 11, 1493, during his second voyage to the New World, though he never actually landed here. The Spanish claimed it initially but showed little interest in developing the territory. Spanish, Dutch, and French forces all laid claim over the following centuries, fighting periodic skirmishes until 1648 when weary Dutch and French colonists — exhausted from conflict and recognizing the futility of continued warfare over such a small piece of land — sat down and hammered out the Treaty of Concordia, agreeing to simply divide the territory between them peacefully. Legend says they started back-to-back and walked the perimeter in opposite directions, meeting on the far side to mark the boundary — though the actual negotiations were likely more bureaucratic than romantic. That agreement, signed in 1648 after the Spanish abandoned the island, has held for nearly four centuries with only minor border adjustments, making it one of the oldest continually honored treaties in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>What makes this split truly remarkable for visitors is how seamlessly you can cross between nations. There are no immigration checkpoints, no passport controls, and no customs inspections. You'll know you've crossed from Dutch to French territory only by subtle changes: road signs switch from kilometers to miles and back, architecture shifts from colorful Caribbean to white-washed Mediterranean, and restaurant menus trade English for French. A small roadside monument marks the official boundary, but most travelers drive right past it without stopping.</p>

          <p>The Dutch side operates with the Netherlands Antillean Guilder as official tender, though American dollars are universally preferred and accepted. Philipsburg serves as the commercial hub with its famous Front Street shopping district, cruise terminal facilities, and Great Bay Beach running parallel to the town. Meanwhile, the French side uses the Euro and maintains a distinctly European character with boulangeries, wine shops, and a more relaxed Mediterranean pace of life. Despite these differences, both sides welcome the same currency in practice — US dollars work everywhere, making navigation between territories effortless.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Cruise Terminal and Getting to Town</h3>
          <p>Ships berth at the <strong>Dr. A.C. Wathey Cruise Terminal</strong> in Philipsburg's Great Bay. The facility itself is modest but functional, with a small duty-free shopping area, information desk, and taxi stand. Once you clear the terminal building — usually a quick two-minute walk from your gangway — you'll find yourself on the waterfront boardwalk with downtown Philipsburg spreading out before you.</p>

          <p>The walk into the heart of Philipsburg's shopping district takes between ten and fifteen minutes at a leisurely pace. You'll follow the boardwalk east past Great Bay Beach toward Front Street where most shops and restaurants cluster. It's a flat, easy stroll with no significant obstacles, making it accessible for most mobility levels. Along the way, local vendors often set up stalls selling fresh fruit, crafts, and cold drinks.</p>

          <p>If you prefer not to walk, water taxis operate regular service along Great Bay, connecting the cruise pier with various points along the beach and town center. These small boats charge about five dollars for a one-way trip or seven dollars for a round-trip ticket. Children typically ride free when accompanied by paying adults. The water taxi ride takes just a few minutes and offers pleasant harbor views as a bonus.</p>

          <p>Land-based taxis also wait outside the terminal. For the short hop into downtown Philipsburg, expect to pay roughly three dollars per person one-way. These are usually shared vans that depart once they fill with passengers. For destinations beyond downtown — Maho Beach, the French side, or island tours — negotiate fares at the taxi stand before departing.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Maho Beach: Where Jets Meet Sand</h3>
          <p>No visit to St. Maarten feels complete without experiencing Maho Beach, often called Airplane Beach for obvious reasons. This stretch of sand sits directly at the end of Princess Juliana International Airport's main runway, placing beachgoers directly in the flight path of arriving jumbo jets descending as low as 100 feet overhead. The spectacle of a massive aircraft — gear down, engines roaring, close enough to read the airline livery — creates one of the Caribbean's most photographed moments and one of its most iconic experiences.</p>

          <p>The airport itself carries fascinating history. During World War II, the United States Army constructed the original runway specifically for anti-submarine patrol flights, part of the critical effort to protect Allied shipping lanes in the Caribbean from German U-boats prowling these waters. What began as a military necessity evolved into Princess Juliana International Airport, now one of the busiest hubs in the Eastern Caribbean. That wartime runway, extended and modernized over the decades, still ends precisely where it did in the 1940s — at the edge of Maho Beach.</p>

          <p>The beach anchors at Sunset Beach Bar, an institution that has turned plane spotting into performance art. They post the day's flight arrival and departure times on a weathered surfboard propped against the fence — travelers crowd around it planning their afternoon like it's a concert schedule. When a 747 or A340 approaches, the crowd wades into the shallows, phones and cameras raised, growing quiet with anticipation. Then the roar builds, that massive shadow sweeps over the water, and suddenly you're ducking instinctively as tons of metal thunder overhead so close you can read the registration numbers on the fuselage. The crowd erupts in cheers. Videos and photos from this vantage point flood social media — it's that dramatic, that visceral, that impossibly close.</p>

          <p>Getting to Maho Beach from the cruise terminal requires some planning. The distance spans roughly 7.8 miles around the western side of the island (that's about 41,184 feet, or roughly 206 full-size aircraft wingspans laid end-to-end, or about the length you'd walk if you changed your mind about swimming 352 times). Flat-rate taxis charge about twenty dollars per person for the trip, making them the most straightforward option if you value time and convenience. The drive takes fifteen to twenty minutes depending on traffic (about the time it takes to watch three planes land and question all your life decisions). Public bus service also runs this route — catch route number 2 from Emmaplein (the bus station near the cruise terminal) for just two dollars per person. The bus ride takes roughly thirty minutes (approximately the time to eat one entire rotisserie chicken from Grand Case, or about six plane landing videos), though service can be irregular and buses get crowded during cruise ship days. Several tour companies run dedicated Maho Beach shuttles from the cruise terminal as well, charging approximately fifteen dollars for round-trip transport and allowing two to three hours at the beach before returning to the port.</p>

          <p>A word of caution: while watching planes land is thrilling, departing aircraft pose genuine danger. The jet blast from large planes taking off can knock adults off their feet and has caused serious injuries requiring hospitalization. Warning signs line the fence behind the beach, and they're not exaggerating. Never hold onto the fence during takeoffs — people have been blown clear across the sand — and keep a safe distance from the runway when engines spool up for departure. Landings are the spectacle; takeoffs are the hazard.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Exploring the Dutch Side: Sint Maarten</h3>
          <p>Philipsburg forms the beating heart of Dutch Sint Maarten, and its origins tell a quintessentially Caribbean tale. The town was founded in 1763 by Commander John Philips, a Scottish sea captain serving in the Dutch Navy — the kind of maritime adventurer who seems pulled straight from a novel. The capital curves gracefully around a golden beach on a narrow isthmus of land barely wider than a few city blocks, squeezed between Great Bay and the Great Salt Pond. That cramped geography gives Philipsburg its distinctive linear character — everything important runs along Front Street.</p>

          <p>Front Street itself, the main commercial thoroughfare, runs parallel to Great Bay for over a mile, lined end-to-end with jewelry stores, electronics shops, liquor outlets, and souvenir vendors. Everything here is duty-free, from designer watches to French cognac to Cuban cigars (legal to purchase but not to bring into the United States). No paperwork or forms are required — just browse, buy, and carry your purchases back to the ship. But amid all this modern commerce, traces of old Philipsburg persist. Look for the old shingled courthouse on Front Street — it was built in 1793 as Commander John Philips' own residence before later becoming the seat of colonial justice. Around Walter Plantz Square, you'll still find weathered gingerbread houses with ornate wooden trim, painted shutters, and galleries, remnants of when this was a proper Dutch Caribbean town rather than a cruise port shopping district.</p>

          <p>Great Bay Beach stretches along the entire length of town, providing easy access to sand and surf without leaving the urban center. The water stays calm and shallow, ideal for a quick swim between shopping excursions. Beach chair and umbrella rentals are available, and bars right on the sand serve cold Carib beer and rum punches. This isn't a pristine, deserted Caribbean beach — it's a busy town beach — but the convenience of walking straight from shops to ocean can't be beat.</p>

          <p>The Dutch side embraces its role as the party side of the island. Casinos operate openly in Philipsburg and at several resorts around the Dutch territory, offering slots, table games, and sports books. Nightlife thrives here, with beach bars hosting live music and sunset parties that extend well into the evening. The atmosphere leans decidedly more commercial and tourist-focused than the French side, but many visitors prefer exactly this kind of energetic, accessible vibe.</p>

          <p>For a taste of authentic Dutch Caribbean culture, hunt down stroopwafels and Dutch pancakes at local cafes tucked between the tourist shops. Stroopwafels — thin waffle cookies sandwiching caramel syrup — show up fresh at bakeries in the morning and disappear by noon. Dutch pancakes, larger and thinner than American versions, come topped with powdered sugar, fruit, or even savory options like cheese and bacon. These small culinary connections to the Netherlands feel incongruous on a tropical island, but that's precisely what makes St. Maarten fascinating.</p>

          <p>Currency on the Dutch side officially operates in Netherlands Antillean Guilders, but this is largely a formality for tourists. American dollars are not just accepted but actively preferred by merchants. Credit cards work everywhere. You'll rarely see actual guilders unless you specifically request local currency as a souvenir. Prices are typically posted in dollars, and change comes back in dollars, making transactions simple for North American visitors.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Discovering French Saint Martin</h3>
          <p>Cross the invisible border to the French side and the island transforms. Marigot, the French capital, wraps around a protected harbor filled with sailboats and fishing vessels. The waterfront promenade hosts sidewalk cafes where waiters serve proper espresso and croissants. Fresh produce markets overflow with tropical fruits, local spices, and handmade crafts. Shops stock French perfumes, wines, and cheeses at prices lower than you'd pay in Paris. Step into any boulangerie in the morning and you'll find warm pains au chocolat and eclairs that would make a Parisian pastry chef nod in approval — flaky, buttery, absolutely authentic. This isn't theme-park France; this is actual France transplanted to the tropics.</p>

          <p>Fort Louis overlooks Marigot from a hillside perch, requiring a steep but short hike to reach the ruins. The climb rewards you with sweeping panoramas of the harbor, town, and neighboring island of Anguilla floating on the horizon. The fort itself dates to French colonial times, though little remains beyond crumbling walls and a few cannon emplacements. The views are the real attraction.</p>

          <p>Orient Bay, about twenty minutes north of Marigot, ranks among the Caribbean's finest beaches. The water glows in impossible shades of turquoise and aquamarine, the sand stays powder-soft, and a line of beach clubs offers loungers, cocktails, and excellent food. This is where the French side truly shines — grilled lobster with garlic butter, chilled rosé wine, and hours spent floating in bath-warm water. Some sections of Orient Bay are clothing-optional, though the main club areas remain family-friendly.</p>

          <p>But if you're serious about food, make the pilgrimage to <strong>Grand Case</strong>, a small village on the northern French coast that bills itself as the "Food Capital of the Caribbean" — and backs up that audacious claim. This single mile-long strip of sand hosts an extraordinary concentration of restaurants, from casual beachside lolos (local grills) serving barbecue ribs and conch stew to white-tablecloth establishments offering French-Caribbean fusion that would earn Michelin attention if Michelin bothered rating Caribbean islands. You'll find escargot served with Creole spices, fresh-caught mahi with beurre blanc, tarte tatin made with local mangoes. The waitstaff speak French, the wine lists run deep, and dinner reservations are genuinely necessary at the better spots. Grand Case takes its culinary reputation seriously enough that food festivals and chef competitions cluster here year-round.</p>

          <p>The French side cultivates a distinctly European atmosphere. Menus appear in French first, English second. Restaurants take culinary excellence seriously — even casual beachside grills serve food that would impress in any major city. Service moves at a more leisurely pace than on the Dutch side. This isn't rushing through duty-free shops; it's lingering over a three-hour lunch, savoring each course, ordering another carafe of rosé because the afternoon is young and the water is that perfect shade of blue. The contrast between the two sides of one small island is striking.</p>

          <p>While the Euro serves as official currency on the French side, American dollars are universally accepted at tourist-oriented businesses. That said, carrying some Euros can be helpful for smaller transactions at local markets or family-run establishments. Exchange rates posted tend to be reasonable, and ATMs dispensing Euros are readily available in Marigot and at Orient Bay.</p>

          <h3>Island Loop Tours</h3>
          <p>One of the most popular shore excursions involves circling the entire island, showcasing the dramatic contrasts between Dutch and French territories. These loop tours typically last four to five hours and make strategic stops at key attractions on both sides. Most itineraries include Marigot for browsing the French markets, Orient Bay for beach time and swimming, and Maho Beach for the airplane experience.</p>

          <p>The route itself provides continuous commentary on the island's history, culture, and unique two-nation arrangement. You'll drive through local neighborhoods, see how residents live away from tourist zones, and gain perspective on the island beyond cruise ship excursion ports. Viewpoints along the route offer photo opportunities of dramatic coastal scenery, neighboring islands, and the sharp geographic differences between the developed Dutch coast and the more natural French coastline.</p>

          <p>Tour operators offer these loops as both group van excursions and private taxi tours. Group tours run more economically, typically charging forty to sixty dollars per person for the full circuit with multiple stops. Private taxi tours cost more — expect to pay one hundred fifty to two hundred dollars for a vehicle accommodating up to four passengers — but allow more flexibility in timing, stops, and pace. Either option provides comprehensive island coverage in a single outing.</p>

          <h3>Beyond the Beaches: Fort Amsterdam and Movie Magic</h3>
          <p>Most visitors come for beaches and planes, but St. Maarten holds a few unexpected treasures worth seeking out. <strong>Fort Amsterdam</strong>, perched on a peninsula just east of Philipsburg, represents the oldest Dutch military fortification in the Caribbean. Built in 1631 shortly after the Dutch first claimed the island, it served as the primary defensive position guarding Great Bay and the colonial settlement. Today, the fort lies largely in ruins — weathered stone walls, crumbling ramparts, and a few mounted cannon pointing eternally seaward. What survives is atmospheric rather than architecturally grand, but history enthusiasts will appreciate walking the same grounds where Dutch soldiers once kept watch for Spanish galleons and English privateers. The views across Philipsburg and Great Bay alone justify the short hike.</p>

          <p>For something completely different, track down the <strong>Yoda Guy Movie Exhibit</strong> tucked away in Philipsburg. This quirky museum was founded by Nick Maley, the special effects artist who helped create Yoda for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>. Maley retired to St. Maarten and opened this small but fascinating collection of Star Wars memorabilia, original concept art, behind-the-scenes photos, and props from various film productions he worked on throughout his career. The space isn't large — you can tour it in thirty minutes — but for movie fans, especially Star Wars devotees, it's a delightful detour. Maley himself often works in the studio and enjoys chatting with visitors about the film industry, special effects techniques, and yes, how they brought that beloved Jedi Master to life with latex, foam, and puppetry decades before CGI dominated Hollywood. It's the sort of unexpected find that makes wandering cruise ports worthwhile.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around St. Maarten</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Dr. A.C. Wathey Pier</strong> puts you steps from downtown Philipsburg. From there:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Taxi:</strong> Operates along Great Bay connecting cruise pier to beaches and town. Five dollars one-way, seven dollars round-trip. Children ride free with paying adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Buses:</strong> Route 2 runs to Maho Beach for two dollars from Emmaplein bus station near the cruise terminal. Service can be irregular but offers the most economical transport. Expect 30 minutes for the ride, though schedules vary and buses get crowded during cruise ship days.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Taxis:</strong> Fixed-rate vans wait at the cruise terminal. Three dollars to downtown, flat rate of twenty dollars per person to Maho Beach, higher rates to French side destinations. Prices are per person, and drivers depart when vehicles fill.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Taxis:</strong> More expensive but faster and more flexible. Negotiate island loop tours or custom itineraries. Rates vary based on destination and number of passengers.</li>
            <li><strong>Rental Cars:</strong> Available at the airport and in Philipsburg, but challenging due to narrow roads, aggressive local driving habits, and lack of traffic signs. Not recommended unless you're comfortable with adventurous driving conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> US dollars accepted universally across the entire island. Dutch side officially uses Netherlands Antillean Guilder (ANG), French side uses Euro (EUR), but American currency works at every establishment. Credit cards are widely accepted. Both sides and USD function interchangeably for all practical purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Duty-Free Paradise:</strong> The entire island operates as a duty-free zone. No import taxes, no sales tax, no VAT, no paperwork required. Purchase liquor, jewelry, electronics, watches, perfumes, and tobacco products at significant savings. Simply buy and carry back to your ship. US customs limits still apply when returning home.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Weather:</strong> December through April offers the driest, most comfortable conditions. Temperatures hover in the low 80s Fahrenheit with lower humidity and steady trade winds. This peak season brings the most cruise ships and highest prices but delivers nearly guaranteed sunshine.</li>
            <li><strong>Hurricane Season:</strong> September and October represent peak hurricane months for the Caribbean. St. Maarten sits directly in the traditional storm path. Major hurricanes have struck the island in recent years, causing significant damage. Most cruise lines avoid scheduling stops during these months, but early and late season sailings (June-August, November) still carry some storm risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> English is spoken widely on both Dutch and French sides. You'll encounter Dutch, French, and Spanish Creole among locals, but virtually all tourist-facing businesses operate comfortably in English. Basic French phrases earn smiles on the northern side but aren't necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Maho Beach Safety:</strong> Jet blast from departing aircraft poses genuine danger. The force can knock adults off their feet and has caused documented injuries requiring hospitalization. Warning signs are not exaggerations. Stay well back from the fence during takeoffs, never hold onto the barrier, and supervise children closely.</li>
            <li><strong>Orient Beach:</strong> The southern end of Orient Beach maintains a clothing-optional policy. The main beach club areas farther north (Kakao Beach, Kontiki Beach Club) are family-friendly and require swimwear. Beach signs clearly mark the boundaries between sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Port Day Timing:</strong> Cruise ships typically arrive early morning (7-8 AM) and depart late evening (6-8 PM), providing ten to twelve hours ashore. This gives ample time to visit both Dutch and French sides, experience Maho Beach, swim at Orient Bay, and shop in Philipsburg all in a single port day.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Safety:</strong> Caribbean waters around St. Maarten stay calm and warm year-round. Great Bay Beach in Philipsburg offers gentle conditions perfect for swimming. Orient Bay can develop moderate surf. All major beaches have designated swimming areas. Jellyfish occasionally appear but aren't a common problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Tropical sun intensity near the equator burns exposed skin quickly. High SPF sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses are essential. Reapply sunscreen after swimming. Beach clubs rent umbrellas and shade loungers. Midday sun (11 AM - 2 PM) hits hardest.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

          <p><strong>Q: Can I visit both French and Dutch sides in one day?</strong><br/>
          A: Easily! The island is only 37 square miles, and the two sides are 20–30 minutes apart by taxi. There's no border checkpoint between them — just a modest monument marking the divide.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Where is the best place for plane spotting?</strong><br/>
          A: Sunset Beach Bar at the end of the runway near Maho Beach is the iconic spot. Planes come in so low you can feel the jet blast. Sign the surfboard fence while you're there!</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What currency is used in St. Maarten?</strong><br/>
          A: USD is widely accepted on both sides. The Dutch side uses Netherlands Antillean guilder and the French side uses euros, but US dollars work virtually everywhere for tourists.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Maho Beach safe during plane landings?</strong><br/>
          A: While watching is a major attraction, you need to exercise caution. The jet blast from departing large aircraft is extremely powerful and has caused injuries. Stay behind the fence during takeoffs and never hold onto it.</p>
