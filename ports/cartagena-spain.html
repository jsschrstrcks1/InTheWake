          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I expected nothing from Cartagena. The itinerary listed it as a minor Spanish port between Barcelona and Gibraltar, a placeholder day that I assumed would involve unremarkable wandering through forgettable streets. I was profoundly wrong. When I walked off the ship and into the old town, I discovered something extraordinary: a city where Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, and modern Spaniards have each left their mark, where I could literally see the layers of civilization stacked atop one another in cross-sections of excavated ruins.</p>

            <p>The walk from the cruise terminal takes perhaps five minutes, crossing the broad waterfront promenade and entering streets lined with Art Nouveau facades that wouldn't look out of place in Barcelona or Brussels. The morning sun caught the ornate balconies and decorative tilework, and I could smell fresh bread from a panadería and strong coffee from corner cafés. However, I wasn't here for architecture from 1900—I was here for architecture from 200 BC, and the Roman Theater awaited.</p>

            <p>The Museo del Teatro Romano is Rafael Moneo's masterpiece—a modern museum that tunnels through a medieval neighborhood to reveal a 2,000-year-old theater hidden underneath. I paid €6 for admission and began descending through galleries that display artifacts recovered during excavation: theatrical masks, pottery, coins stamped with Roman emperors' faces. Then the tunnel opened into daylight and I stood at the top of the ancient cavea, looking down at stone seats where Roman citizens once watched comedies and tragedies. The theater was discovered in 1988 under demolished buildings—it had been completely forgotten, buried for centuries, and its survival seemed miraculous.</p>

            <p>I sat on the ancient stone seats for nearly an hour, watching tour groups come and go, listening to guides explain in Spanish and English and German how this theater seated 6,000 spectators in the 1st century BC. The Mediterranean sun warmed the limestone. I thought about all the performances that had echoed across these seats, all the laughter and tears, all the lives lived and forgotten in this small corner of the Roman Empire. My breath caught at the weight of accumulated time, the strange privilege of sitting where Romans had sat while their empire still ruled the world.</p>

            <p>From the theater, I walked to the Punic Wall—one of the few surviving Carthaginian fortifications in Europe. The interpretive center (€3.50) explains how Carthaginian general Hasdrubal founded this city in 227 BC, naming it Qart Hadasht (New City) after Carthage itself. When Rome conquered it in 209 BC during the Second Punic War, they renamed it Carthago Nova and made it a provincial capital. The wall sections visible today date from the Carthaginian period—I was touching stones that Hannibal's soldiers might have walked past on their way to invade Italy.</p>

            <p>The old town reveals its layers casually, almost carelessly. A medieval cathedral sits atop Roman ruins. Art Nouveau facades front streets that follow the original Roman grid. Archaeological excavations peek from behind construction barriers. I wandered through Plaza del Ayuntamiento, admiring the modernist town hall, then followed Calle Mayor—the main shopping street—past boutiques and tapas bars that seemed remarkably free of tourist-trap desperation. This felt like a Spanish city that happened to have a cruise port, not a cruise port that happened to be in Spain.</p>

            <p>For lunch I found Bar el Submarino, a tiny place near the naval museum that the locals clearly favored over any waterfront establishment. The marinara (sailor's stew with seafood and saffron) arrived in an earthenware bowl, steam rising fragrant with garlic and tomatoes, accompanied by crusty bread for soaking up every drop. The price was €12 including a glass of local wine. I ate slowly, watching dock workers on their lunch break, listening to conversations I couldn't understand but somehow felt included in. The flavors lingered—briny mussels, tender squid, the particular sweetness of Spanish tomatoes in summer.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, what surprised me most was the absence of crowds. The cruise ship had brought perhaps 2,000 passengers, yet the Roman Theater held maybe fifty visitors when I was there. The Punic Wall had a handful. The streets felt genuinely Spanish rather than internationally touristy. This anonymity felt like a gift—a chance to experience antiquity without the overwhelming hordes that make places like Pompeii or the Colosseum exhausting. I returned to the ship with unexpected tears in my eyes, not from sadness but from gratitude—gratitude for discovering something precious that I hadn't known to look for.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Sitting alone in that Roman Theater as the afternoon light turned golden on ancient stone. The accumulated weight of 2,000 years pressed gently against my chest. My heart ached with the peculiar loneliness of encountering the past—the knowledge that everyone who built this theater, everyone who performed here, everyone who laughed and wept in these seats, has been gone for millennia, yet somehow the stone remembers. I felt connected to something vast and mysterious, a participant in humanity's long conversation across time.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Cartagena taught me never to dismiss an unexpected port. What I learned here will stay with me: that the best discoveries often hide in places we expected nothing from, that layers of civilization reward patient attention, and that Spain still holds treasures that the tourist industry has somehow overlooked.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cartagena's cruise terminal sits on the commercial port, a five-minute walk from the old town. Ships dock directly—no tender required. The terminal building offers basic facilities: tourist information, restrooms, WiFi. Walking into town is easy and recommended; the waterfront promenade leads directly to the main attractions.</p>

            <p>The old town is compact and walkable. The Roman Theater, Punic Wall, main shopping streets, and waterfront restaurants all lie within a 15-minute walking radius. Currency is Euros; ATMs and card acceptance widespread. English is spoken at tourist sites but less common in local establishments—basic Spanish phrases help. Wheelchair accessibility is moderate in the flat town center; the Roman Theater museum has elevator access. This is a working Spanish city, not a purpose-built cruise destination.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Cartagena is best explored on foot. The compact old town contains all major attractions within easy walking distance, and the relatively flat terrain makes for comfortable exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The primary mode of transport. From the cruise terminal, walk 5 minutes along the waterfront promenade to reach the old town. Roman Theater 10 minutes, Punic Wall 15 minutes, main shopping district 5 minutes. Low to moderate stamina required. Streets are generally flat with some cobblestones. Comfortable walking shoes recommended.</p>

            <p><strong>Tourist Train:</strong> A small tourist train (€5) loops through the old town and up to the Castillo de la Concepción for panoramic views. Runs hourly during cruise ship visits. Good option for those with mobility concerns or limited time. Book tickets at the waterfront near the terminal.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at the cruise terminal for reaching beaches (Cala Cortina 10 minutes) or surrounding areas. Approximately €10-15 to local destinations. Uber not widely used; traditional taxis reliable. Go independent for flexibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Regional Excursions:</strong> Murcia city (45 minutes) and the Mar Menor lagoon (30 minutes) accessible by taxi or organized tour. Ship excursions available but usually unnecessary—Cartagena itself provides more than enough for a full port day. For those interested in regional exploration, go independent with a hired car or join a small-group tour.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The flat town center offers reasonable wheelchair accessibility. Roman Theater museum has elevator access to viewing areas. Some cobblestone streets present challenges. Moderate stamina suitable for most visitors; low stamina sufficient if focusing only on the waterfront and main plaza.</p>

            <p>Cartagena rewards independent exploration—the compact walkable center makes organized tours unnecessary for most visitors. Ship excursions exist but often spend too little time at key sites. Go independent for flexibility and deeper engagement with this remarkable port.</p>

            <h3>Roman Theater Museum</h3>
            <p>The must-see attraction in Cartagena. Rafael Moneo's modern museum tunnels through medieval streets to reveal the excavated 1st-century BC theater. Admission €6 ($6.50). Allow 60-90 minutes for museum galleries and time sitting in the ancient seats. Audio guides available (€3). Open Tuesday-Sunday; check seasonal hours. 10-minute walk from cruise terminal. Go independent—no booking needed. Low stamina with elevator access. Wheelchair accessible to viewing platforms. One of Spain's finest archaeological experiences.</p>

            <h3>Punic Wall Interpretive Center</h3>
            <p>See actual Carthaginian fortifications from 227 BC—among the only surviving examples in Europe. The small but well-designed museum (€3.50) explains the Punic Wars, Hannibal's connection to the city, and the broader context of Carthaginian civilization. 15-minute walk from terminal through pleasant streets. Allow 30-45 minutes for full appreciation. Open Tuesday-Sunday. Go independent—no booking needed. Low stamina; mostly accessible. Combined tickets available with other museums for modest savings.</p>

            <h3>Castillo de la Concepción</h3>
            <p>Medieval castle crowning the hill above town, offering panoramic views of the port, city, and Mediterranean. Admission €3.75 or combined ticket. Reach it via tourist train (€5), panoramic elevator (free), or walking (steep—moderate to high stamina). Allow 45-60 minutes including transport. Go independent. Views are spectacular; castle interior modest. Book ahead only for elevator at peak times.</p>

            <h3>Art Nouveau Walking Route</h3>
            <p>Self-guided walk through the old town admiring ornate facades from the early 1900s mining boom. Free—just walk and look up. Start at Plaza del Ayuntamiento (town hall), continue along Calle Mayor and connecting streets. Maps available at tourist office. Allow 30-60 minutes. Low stamina on flat streets. Combine with shopping and cafe stops. No booking needed—go independent.</p>

            <h3>Cala Cortina</h3>
            <p>Small sandy cove 2 km from the center, accessible by taxi (€10) or pleasant 30-minute walk along the coastal path with views of the fortified harbor entrance. Calm water for swimming in the protected bay, simple restaurant for fresh seafood lunch. Sun loungers and umbrellas available for rent during summer months. Allow 2-3 hours if combining with swim and meal. Go independent—no ship excursion offers this destination. Moderate stamina for walking access; taxi makes it low stamina. Popular with locals on weekends—arrive early for best spots. The cove offers a genuine local experience away from tourist areas, with prices significantly lower than waterfront establishments.</p>

          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Cartagena's strategic natural harbor has attracted settlers for over 2,200 years. Carthaginian general Hasdrubal founded Qart Hadasht (New City) in 227 BC, creating a base for Carthaginian expansion in Spain and a staging point for Hannibal's legendary invasion of Italy. When Roman general Scipio Africanus captured the city in 209 BC, he renamed it Carthago Nova and developed it into one of Rome's most important provincial capitals.</p>

            <p>The Roman period left the most visible remains, including the remarkable theater that lay hidden for centuries until its 1988 discovery. Byzantine and Visigothic rulers followed Rome's collapse. The city endured centuries of relative obscurity before reviving in the 18th century as Spain's principal Mediterranean naval base—a role it maintains today. The Spanish Navy's submarine base gives modern Cartagena a working military character alongside its ancient monuments.</p>

            <p>The early 1900s mining boom brought wealthy industrialists who built the Art Nouveau mansions that now line the old town streets. This brief period of prosperity created an architectural legacy that rivals better-known cities. The combination of Carthaginian walls, Roman theaters, medieval castles, and modernist facades makes Cartagena a living textbook of Mediterranean civilization—all walkable from the cruise terminal.</p>

              <summary>Is Cartagena Spain worth visiting?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely—one of Spain's most underrated cruise ports. The Roman Theater alone justifies the visit, but the combination of Carthaginian ruins, Art Nouveau architecture, and authentic Spanish atmosphere makes it exceptional. Most visitors are pleasantly surprised by how much there is to see.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How far is town from the cruise port?</summary>
              <p>Five minutes on foot. The cruise terminal is on the commercial port, directly adjacent to the old town. Walk along the waterfront promenade and you're in the historic center immediately. No shuttle required.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I see everything in one port day?</summary>
              <p>Yes, comfortably. The Roman Theater, Punic Wall, castle, and Art Nouveau district can all be visited in 4-5 hours with time for lunch. This is a compact, walkable port that rewards thorough exploration.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Cartagena Spain the same as Cartagena Colombia?</summary>
              <p>No—completely different cities on different continents. This guide covers Cartagena, Spain, on the Mediterranean coast. Cartagena, Colombia is in South America. Cruise itineraries sometimes include both, so check your specific port carefully.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Should I book shore excursions or explore independently?</summary>
              <p>Go independent. The compact walkable center makes organized tours unnecessary. Pay admission at each museum individually, eat lunch where locals eat, and set your own pace. Ship excursions add cost without adding value in this particular port.</p>
