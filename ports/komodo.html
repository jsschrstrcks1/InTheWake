        <h1>Komodo: Where Dragons Walk the Earth</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>There are places on Earth where you step ashore and know immediately that you've left the modern world behind. Komodo is one of them. As the tender approached the volcanic shore of Rinca Island, I watched a ranger scanning the dock with binoculars — not for visitors, but for dragons. "They like to rest under the buildings," he said casually, as if discussing stray cats. Except these "cats" are ten-foot carnivorous lizards that have ruled these islands for four million years.</p>

          <p>Komodo National Park encompasses three major islands — Komodo, Rinca, and Padar — scattered across the turquoise waters between Flores and Sumbawa in eastern Indonesia. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, though I suspect the dragons care little for human accolades. They were here before we invented writing, before we built ships, before we decided some animals belonged in zoos and others in wilderness preserves. The dragons never left. We're the visitors.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Rounding a bend on the medium trek and finding three adult dragons sprawled beneath a lontar palm, exactly where the ranger said they'd be. One lifted his head — massive, prehistoric, utterly indifferent to our presence. His forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air for carrion or deer or foolish humans who wandered from the group. The ranger placed his hand on his carved wooden stick, the only defense between us and creatures that can run twice as fast as humans and swim just as efficiently. "Stay close," he whispered. I did.
          </div>

          <p>This is a tender port, and that matters more than usual. Ships anchor offshore because there are no deep-water facilities — only volcanic islands rising sharply from the sea. The journey to shore, whether by ship's tender or local boat, takes you past waters that shimmer in impossible shades of blue and green, where manta rays glide beneath the surface and reef fish dart through coral gardens. The remoteness isn't inconvenient. It's the point. Dragons don't thrive near highways and souvenir shops.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you tender ashore.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Tender port — ships anchor offshore at Komodo or Rinca Island; passengers tendered to shore or taken by local boats</li>
            <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> Labuan Bajo on Flores Island (2-hour boat ride to Rinca Island); small fishing town with limited facilities</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Yes — all access is via tender or local boat; weather-dependent; sea conditions can cancel shore excursions</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Indonesian Rupiah (IDR); limited ATMs on Flores; bring cash for park fees; USD sometimes accepted</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian); limited English at ranger stations</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Not applicable — islands accessible only by boat; Flores has left-side driving</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> April-June and September-November (dry season, calmer seas); December-March wet with rougher conditions</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time in the dragon kingdom.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dragon Trek on Rinca Island</h4>
          <p>Most accessible dragon encounter. Rangers lead treks from Loh Buaya ranger station. Short trek (30 min, easy, shaded waterhole views), medium trek (1 hour, dragon nests, savannah, lontar palms), or long trek (2 hours, steep, panoramic views, best wildlife). Park fees: 150,000 IDR weekdays, 225,000 IDR weekends, plus 100,000 IDR island fee. Rinca has 2,000+ dragons, less crowded than Komodo. Early morning best (cooler, dragons active). Rangers mandatory — never trek alone.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dragon Trek on Komodo Island</h4>
          <p>Larger, more challenging hikes on the original "dragon island" with 1,700 Komodo dragons. More rugged terrain, longer boat ride from Labuan Bajo. Similar trek options (short, medium, long). Dragons often spotted near ranger station. Same park fees apply. Choose Komodo if you want fewer tourists and don't mind harder hiking. Both islands guarantee dragon sightings — rangers know their territories.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Snorkeling at Pink Beach (Pantai Merah)</h4>
          <p>Rare pink sand beach (crushed red coral) on Komodo Island. Exceptional snorkeling — vibrant coral reefs, manta rays, sea turtles, reef sharks, technicolor fish. Water clarity stunning. Half-day tours often combine dragon trek + Pink Beach. Bring reef-safe sunscreen (marine park protected). Snorkel gear provided on tours. This is world-class diving territory — Jacques Cousteau called these waters one of Earth's best.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Padar Island Viewpoint Hike</h4>
          <p>Instagram-famous panoramic viewpoint overlooking three bays with different colored sands. Steep 30-minute hike (wooden steps, exposed sun, challenging) rewards with 360-degree views of volcanic landscapes meeting turquoise sea. No dragons on Padar, but the vistas are Jurassic. Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) spectacular. Bring water — shade minimal. Often combined with Rinca/Komodo treks in full-day tours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Labuan Bajo Town (Flores Island)</h4>
          <p>Gateway fishing village transforming into eco-tourism hub. Waterfront cafes, local markets, fresh seafood, boat-building yards. Mirror Cave (Goa Cermin) nearby with underground pools and stalactites. Cunca Wulang Canyon offers waterfall rappelling. If your ship tenders to Flores instead of the islands, Labuan Bajo provides cultural immersion while others chase dragons. Authentic Indonesia, pre-resort development.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tender Operations:</strong> All access via ship tenders or local boats. Sea conditions dictate operations — rough weather cancels shore trips. Follow crew instructions for boarding.</li>
            <li><strong>Island Access:</strong> Rinca closer to Labuan Bajo (2 hours by boat); Komodo farther (3-4 hours). Ships typically tender to one island. Independent travel between islands requires private boat charter (~$100-200).</li>
            <li><strong>On-Island Movement:</strong> Walking only. Treks start from ranger stations (Loh Buaya on Rinca, Loh Liang on Komodo). Rangers lead all groups. Terrain ranges from easy boardwalks to steep volcanic trails. Good walking shoes essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Labuan Bajo:</strong> If tendered to Flores, taxis and motorbike rentals available (~50,000-100,000 IDR for town trips). Town walkable but hilly.</li>
            <li><strong>Tours:</strong> Ship excursions recommended — logistics complex for independent travel. Local tour operators in Labuan Bajo offer packages if ship allows independent shore time.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh Grilled Fish:</strong> Labuan Bajo specializes in seafood — red snapper, barracuda, tuna, grouper grilled over coconut husks. Waterfront warungs (local cafes) serve catch-of-the-day with sambal (chili paste) and rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Ikan Bakar:</strong> Indonesian grilled fish marinated in turmeric, ginger, lemongrass. Charred, smoky, spicy. Served whole with lime and fresh vegetables.</li>
            <li><strong>Nasi Goreng &amp; Mie Goreng:</strong> Fried rice and fried noodles — Indonesian staples. Simple, satisfying, available everywhere. Often topped with fried egg and prawn crackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Gado-Gado:</strong> Indonesian salad — steamed vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, tofu, tempeh with peanut sauce. Vegetarian option that's hearty and flavorful.</li>
            <li><strong>Sate (Satay):</strong> Grilled skewers — chicken, goat, fish — with peanut sauce or sweet soy glaze. Street food perfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Bintang Beer &amp; Kopi:</strong> Indonesia's favorite lager (light, crisp) and thick, sweet Indonesian coffee served in small cups. Fuel for dragon hunting.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather is everything</strong> — tender operations cancel in rough seas. Morning departures generally calmer. If seas look questionable, ship may skip the port entirely.</li>
            <li><strong>Rinca vs Komodo:</strong> Rinca closer, easier terrain, better sightings near ranger station, less crowded. Komodo more remote, challenging hikes. Both guarantee dragons. Choose based on fitness level and available time.</li>
            <li><strong>Early morning treks best</strong> — dragons most active before heat peaks (7-9 AM). Cooler temperatures make hiking more comfortable. Afternoon sun brutal on exposed trails.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear closed-toe shoes with grip</strong> — volcanic terrain rocky and uneven. Sandals dangerous. Rangers won't allow flip-flops on treks.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring water, sunblock, hat</strong> — limited shade on islands. Food/water available at ranger stations but limited selection. Hydrate before hiking.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay with your ranger</strong> — dragons can run twice human speed and swim efficiently. Never wander alone. Follow ranger instructions exactly. They carry forked sticks, not guns.</li>
            <li><strong>Park fees cash only</strong> — 150,000 IDR weekdays (about $10), 225,000 IDR weekends (about $15), plus 100,000 IDR per island visited ($6-7). Bring Indonesian Rupiah — USD sometimes accepted but poor exchange rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Dragons move slowly until they don't. Keep distance ranger specifies (usually 3-5 meters minimum). Zoom lens helpful. Don't crouch or make sudden movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Snorkeling gear:</strong> If tour includes Pink Beach, reef-safe sunscreen mandatory. Coral reefs protected — chemical sunscreens damage ecosystems. Gear usually provided but bring your own mask if you have fit issues.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Author's Note</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake—charts drawn from research, captain's wisdom, and the accounts of fellow travelers. I write them knowing that the truest understanding comes only when you stand on the pier, smell the salt air, and trace the streets with your own feet. When my anchor finally drops here, I'll return to these pages and tell you what I found.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: This is a tender port — ships anchor offshore. Passengers are tendered to Rinca Island, Komodo Island, or Labuan Bajo on Flores depending on ship's itinerary.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Will I actually see Komodo dragons?</strong><br/>A: Yes. Rangers know where dragons congregate (watering holes, nesting areas, ranger station shade). Rinca has 2,000+ dragons, Komodo has 1,700. Sightings virtually guaranteed on guided treks.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is it safe?</strong><br/>A: Yes, with precautions. Stay with your ranger, follow instructions, maintain distance, no sudden movements. Dragons are wild predators but attacks extremely rare when protocols followed. Rangers experienced in dragon behavior.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Should I book a ship excursion or go independent?</strong><br/>A: Ship excursion recommended. Logistics complex — tender operations, boat transfers, park fees, mandatory rangers. Independent travel requires pre-arranged local tour operator and permission to travel independently (not all ships allow it).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the difference between Rinca and Komodo?</strong><br/>A: Rinca is closer (2 hrs from Labuan Bajo), easier terrain, less crowded, excellent dragon sightings. Komodo is larger, more remote (3-4 hrs), harder hikes, slightly fewer tourists. Both have abundant dragons. Choose Rinca if time/fitness limited.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What should I wear?</strong><br/>A: Closed-toe walking shoes with grip (essential), light breathable clothing, hat, sunglasses. Bring small backpack with water, sunscreen, camera. Long pants recommended (protects from sun and brush).</p>
