          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The island rose from the Atlantic like something from a dream—green cliffs plunging into deep blue water, terraced gardens climbing impossible slopes, and Funchal itself tumbling down the mountainside in a cascade of terracotta roofs and flowering vines. Our ship slid into the harbor as the morning sun caught the white facades of the old town, and I understood immediately why sailors have been finding refuge here for six centuries. This volcanic island in the middle of nowhere has been growing things the world wants ever since Portuguese explorers arrived in 1419. First sugar, then wine, now tourists seeking beauty that requires no interpretation.</p>

            <p>The cable car to Monte became our first adventure. The red gondolas rose smoothly from the harbor area, climbing over rooftops and banana plantations, the view expanding with every passing minute. My wife gripped my hand as we cleared the final buildings and the full sweep of the bay opened below—the harbor shrinking to toy scale, the ship that had seemed so large now a white speck against the blue. The air smelled of eucalyptus and warm earth and something floral I couldn't identify. At 550 meters, Monte station delivered us into another world: cooler temperatures, mist threading through forest, and the famous gardens waiting.</p>

            <p>Monte Palace Tropical Garden exceeded every expectation. Fifteen acres of terraced pathways wound through collections from every continent—African cycads, Japanese pagodas, Australian tree ferns, tiles from Portuguese colonies spanning five centuries. We wandered past koi ponds where massive fish glided in water so clear they seemed to float in air, past azalea hedges exploding with pink blooms, past stone Buddha statues guarding moss-covered steps. A peacock wandered across our path, dragging its magnificent tail through the gravel with complete indifference to the humans photographing it. The smell of flowers mixed with damp earth created an atmosphere almost intoxicating.</p>

            <p>Then came the toboggan. The Carros de Cesto have been sliding passengers down from Monte since the 1850s—wicker baskets mounted on wooden runners, guided by two carreiros in white clothing and straw hats. We climbed into the basket, sitting on cushions that did little to disguise how flimsy this contraption seemed. The carreiros grinned, gripped their ropes, and pushed. Suddenly we were flying down the steep streets, the basket skidding on polished cobblestones, the carreiros running alongside and steering with their boots. Two kilometers of controlled chaos, the city rushing past in a blur of walls and gardens and startled pedestrians. My wife screamed with laughter. I may have screamed too. It felt like being children again, surrendering to absurdity, trusting strangers to keep us safe on a journey that made no logical sense.</p>

            <p>The afternoon found us at Blandy's Wine Lodge, tasting Madeira wines that have been aged in these buildings since 1811. Our guide explained how the wines are heated slowly in estufas, mimicking the tropical voyage that originally created them by accident when barrels crossed the equator. I tasted a 10-year Verdelho, amber and complex, with notes of caramel and orange peel and something deeper I couldn't name. Then a 20-year Bual, richer still. Then—remarkably—a 1977 vintage, dark as mahogany, so concentrated that each sip demanded attention. The taste lingered on my tongue for minutes afterward, a flavor that connected me to makers decades gone, to grapes grown in volcanic soil under Atlantic skies.</p>

            <p>We walked the levadas briefly, following one of the ancient irrigation channels that crisscross Madeira's mountains. These narrow waterways, some dating back five hundred years, were engineered to carry water from the wet north to the dry south, and the footpaths alongside them have become world-famous hiking routes. Our short walk took us through laurel forest, past ferns dripping with moisture, alongside water that had been flowing since before anyone alive was born. The sound of that running water mixed with birdsong created a silence that was somehow louder than the city we'd left behind. Yet even this brief walk hinted at the deeper peace these mountain paths might offer.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That toboggan descent, my wife's laughter mixing with mine, the sheer absurdity of two middle-aged Americans careening down a Portuguese hillside in a wicker basket. My heart swelled with the joy of it—the unexpectedness, the silliness, the gift of being together in a place neither of us could have imagined. I thought about how travel at its best strips away dignity and replaces it with wonder. Tears pricked my eyes, though whether from laughter or emotion I couldn't say. I learned something in Funchal about surrendering control, about trusting joy when it arrives, about letting yourself be a child again even when your knees protest. I felt blessed and grateful to share that ridiculous, beautiful moment with the person I love most.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Funchal harbor cruise terminal, a convenient location within walking distance of the historic city center. The terminal has basic facilities—restrooms, tourist information, taxi stand, and car rental desks. The Zona Velha (old town) begins immediately beyond the terminal gates. Many attractions require transportation via cable car, taxi, or tour bus due to the steep terrain.</p>

            <p>Currency is Euro (EUR). Credit cards are widely accepted at major establishments. ATMs are available throughout Funchal. Prices are moderate for European standards: expect to pay €12-18 for lunch, €3-4 for coffee, €15-25 for cellar tours, €30 per person for the toboggan ride. The Monte cable car round trip costs approximately €18.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate to high.</strong> Funchal is built on steep hillsides—the city climbs from sea level to over 500 meters. Walking involves significant hills and stairs. The cable car eliminates uphill climbing to Monte. The toboggan ride descends; a second cable car or taxi returns you to upper areas. Wheelchair access is limited by terrain, though the harbor area and some gardens have accessible paths. Levada walks range from easy to strenuous depending on the route chosen.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Cable cars:</strong> The Teleférico do Funchal rises from the harbor area to Monte in about 15 minutes. Round trip approximately €18. A second cable car connects Monte to the Botanical Gardens. Cable cars eliminate the exhausting uphill walks and provide spectacular views. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for cruise ship days when lines can be long; alternatively, arrive early.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Offer <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and combine multiple attractions efficiently. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($80-150) typically include Monte, toboggan, and cellar tours with transportation handled. Good for those who want structured days. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through your cruise line. For Monte alone, <strong>independent</strong> via cable car is straightforward.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at the terminal and throughout the city. Metered fares; drivers are generally honest. Taxis to Monte approximately €15-20 one way. Useful for reaching levada trailheads or the Botanical Gardens. Can arrange waiting time for day trips. Drivers often speak some English and can suggest routes.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The harbor area and Zona Velha are walkable on relatively flat terrain. The Lido promenade offers pleasant seafront strolling. However, the city's steep hills make walking to Monte or upper attractions extremely challenging. Save your energy for level walks and use cable cars or taxis for elevation changes.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Funchal's terrain presents significant challenges for wheelchair users. The harbor area and some gardens have accessible paths. Cable cars can accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice—contact the operator when booking. Many attractions involve steps and uneven surfaces. The toboggan ride is not accessible. Visitors with mobility limitations should communicate needs carefully when booking excursions.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Funchal offers gardens, scenic rides, cellar tours, and levada walks. Most cruise calls (8-10 hours) allow time for Monte plus cellar tours or gardens. The toboggan ride is iconic but optional. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> combine attractions efficiently; <strong>independent</strong> exploration via cable car works well for focused visits. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for cable cars and cellar tours during cruise ship days.</p>

            <h3>Monte Palace Tropical Garden</h3>
            <p>Fifteen acres of terraced gardens with plants from every continent, Japanese pagodas, tile collections, and koi ponds. Reached by cable car (15 min from harbor, €18 round trip) or taxi (€15-20). Garden entrance approximately €15. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for cable car to avoid cruise-day queues. <strong>Independent</strong> visit straightforward. Moderate stamina—terraced paths with some steep sections. Allow 2-3 hours for proper exploration. The views alone are worth the visit.</p>

            <h3>Monte Toboggan Ride</h3>
            <p>Iconic wicker basket sleds descending from Monte to Livramento, steered by two carreiros in traditional dress. Two kilometers, approximately 10 minutes. Cost €30 per person (two passengers per basket). Queues can be long; departs from just outside Monte Palace. <strong>Independent</strong> experience—no booking needed, just queue. After the ride, take taxi or second cable car back up. Low stamina—you just sit. Exhilarating and slightly terrifying. Not accessible for wheelchair users.</p>

            <h3>Blandy's Wine Lodge</h3>
            <p>Historic wine lodge offering tours and tastings of Madeira wines aged since 1811. Tours explain the unique heating process that creates these legendary fortified wines. Located in central Funchal, walkable from the port (15 min uphill). Tour with tasting approximately €20-40 depending on vintages. <strong>Book ahead</strong> at bfrench-brands.com or join tours on arrival if space allows. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy. Low stamina. Allow 1-2 hours. The older vintages are extraordinary.</p>

            <h3>Funchal Botanical Gardens</h3>
            <p>Eight hectares showcasing 3,000 plant species from tropical and subtropical regions. Excellent bird collection. Reached by second cable car from Monte or by taxi directly from harbor (€10-15). Entrance approximately €7. Offers different experience from Monte Palace—more scientific, equally beautiful. <strong>Independent</strong> visit straightforward. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> sometimes combine both gardens. Moderate stamina—hillside paths. Allow 2 hours.</p>

            <h3>Levada Walk</h3>
            <p>Hiking along Madeira's famous irrigation channels through laurel forest. Routes range from easy 2-hour walks to challenging full-day treks. Ship excursions ($60-100) provide transport to trailheads and guides. For <strong>independent</strong> visits, arrange taxi transport (communicate pickup time clearly). Popular routes include Levada do Rei and Levada das 25 Fontes. Stamina varies by route—easy to strenuous. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for guided tours. Bring water, sturdy shoes, rain layer.</p>

            <h3>Old Town Walking</h3>
            <p>The Zona Velha features narrow streets, painted doorways (Projecto Arte de Portas Abertas), fishermen's taverns, and the beautiful São Tiago Fortress. Flat terrain makes this the easiest exploration from the port. <strong>Independent</strong> walking requires no booking—simply wander. The farmers' market (Mercado dos Lavradores) sells tropical fruits and flowers. Low stamina. Allow 2-3 hours. Excellent for those who prefer urban exploration over mountain attractions.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Volcanic origins:</strong> Madeira rose from the Atlantic Ocean floor through volcanic eruptions starting around 20 million years ago. The island is actually the peak of an enormous underwater mountain—from sea floor to summit, it would rival Mount Everest. This volcanic soil, combined with subtropical climate and abundant water from the trade winds, creates the exceptional growing conditions that have made Madeira famous for agriculture. The dramatic cliffs, deep valleys, and steep terrain that challenge visitors today are all products of this violent geological past.</p>

            <p><strong>The wine that crossed the equator:</strong> Madeira wine was created by accident when merchants discovered that casks shipped to the tropics and back developed remarkable flavors. The heat of equatorial crossing transformed ordinary wine into something extraordinary. Today, producers replicate this process in heated rooms called estufas, slowly warming the wine over months or years. The result is one of the world's most durable wines—opened bottles can last for years, and some vintages remain drinkable after centuries.</p>

            <p><strong>Toboggan tradition:</strong> The Monte toboggans began as practical transportation in the 1850s, carrying residents down from the hill village to the city below. The wicker baskets, mounted on greased wooden runners, could descend steep streets faster than any horse. Ernest Hemingway rode them and declared the experience unforgettable. Today, the two-person baskets remain essentially unchanged, steered by carreiros using their rubber-soled boots as brakes. It's transportation as theater, history as amusement.</p>

            <p><strong>Levadas:</strong> Madeira's irrigation channels date back to the 15th century, when settlers needed to transport water from the wet northern mountains to the drier south. Over 2,500 kilometers of these narrow channels crisscross the island, many carved through solid rock by hand. The maintenance paths alongside them have become world-famous hiking routes, threading through laurel forests unchanged since the dinosaurs. Walking a levada connects you to five centuries of agricultural engineering while immersing you in landscapes that feel prehistoric.</p>
