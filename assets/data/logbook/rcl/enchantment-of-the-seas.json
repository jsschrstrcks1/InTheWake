      "markdown": "**Grandma turned 80 and wanted one thing: to see the ocean from a ship.**\n\nShe'd never cruised. Never wanted to—too crowded, too much walking, too overwhelming. But at 80, something shifted. \"Before I can't anymore,\" she said.\n\nWe chose [Enchantment](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html) specifically. Vision Class ships are smaller—manageable for someone who tires easily. The glass walls meant she could see the ocean from almost anywhere without needing to climb to an outdoor deck.\n\nHer birthday dinner in the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) was perfect. We'd told Guest Services about the occasion. They brought a cake with candles. The servers sang. Grandma cried—happy tears, she insisted.\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge became her favorite spot. Glass walls, 360-degree views, comfortable seating. She spent hours there watching the ocean, reading, napping in the sunlight. \"I finally understand,\" she told me. \"Why people love this.\"\n\nOn our CocoCay day, she stayed aboard. We worried she'd feel left out. Instead, she had the Solarium nearly to herself—quiet, warm, peaceful. \"The best day of the trip,\" she said later.\n\nShe's 83 now. Still talks about that cruise. Still asks when we're going again.\n\n**The lesson:** Enchantment's smaller size and glass-wall design made cruising accessible for my 80-year-old grandmother.

      "markdown": "**I booked Enchantment solo, terrified I'd spend four days eating alone and feeling awkward.**\n\nI'm 34, recently divorced, and my therapist suggested solo travel as a way to rediscover who I am outside of my marriage. Cruising seemed safe—structured, social options available but not required, beautiful destinations.\n\nEnchantment's smaller size was key. At 2,250 guests instead of 7,000, you see the same faces repeatedly. By day two, I recognized people. By day three, we were nodding hello. By day four, I had dinner companions.\n\nThe [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) became my social hub. Easy to sit alone without feeling awkward, but also easy to join conversations. A retired couple from Ohio noticed me reading and struck up a conversation. A woman my age traveling with her mom invited me to trivia.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), I sat at the bar. Met another solo traveler—a nurse from Texas on her first cruise. We ended up exploring Nassau together the next day, splitting a taxi, sharing the adventure.\n\nHere's what I learned: smaller ships force connection. You can't disappear into anonymity on Enchantment. Someone will notice you. Someone will say hello. Someone will make space at their table.\n\nI've cruised solo three times since. Always choose smaller ships. Always find my people.\n\nSee [our solo cruising guide](/solo/solo-cruising-practical-guide.html) and [Tina's story](/solo/why-i-started-solo-cruising.html) for more solo inspiration.",

      "markdown": "**Our wedding cost too much. Our honeymoon budget was whatever was left—which wasn't much.**\n\nWe'd dreamed of a Caribbean cruise. Reality was $800 total for four nights. Everyone said it couldn't be done. They were wrong.\n\nEnchantment's Bahamas itinerary was $89 per person per day. Balcony cabin upgrade was $50 total. We brought our own champagne (allowed in carry-on), bought the drink package on sale, and splurged exactly once on [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html).\n\nTotal cost: $760 for four nights. Caribbean honeymoon. Balcony sunsets. Private dinners at assigned tables. Ship small enough that the crew learned we were newlyweds and brought us extra desserts.\n\nThe cabin was small but who cares? We were on a ship. We had a balcony. We watched the sun set over the Bahamas from our own private outdoor space. Romantic enough for us.\n\n[CocoCay](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ports/perfect-day-cococay-bahamas) was the highlight. Turquoise water, white sand, swim-up bar. Same beach the $300/night cruises visit. We looked just as newlywed as everyone else.\n\nPeople pay thousands for honeymoon cruises on flashy new ships. We paid $760 and had the same ocean, same ports, same Caribbean experience. Enchantment doesn't try to be Icon or Wonder. It tries to be a comfortable, well-run cruise ship. And it succeeds.\n\nWe're still married. Still budget-conscious. Still cruise on older ships. Zero regrets.\n\nSee our [cruise budgeting guide](/planning.html) for more affordable cruise tips.",

Always said \"someday.\" Someday never came. Now I was 68, alone, and my daughter booked Enchantment for us—a short Bahamas sailing, nothing overwhelming.\n\nI cried at embarkation. Walking onto a ship without him felt like betrayal. My daughter held my hand and said what I needed to hear: \"Mom, he'd want you to see this.\"\n\nEnchantment was perfect for grief. Small enough to feel intimate, not lost in crowds. Quiet spaces everywhere—the Solarium, the Viking Crown Lounge, deck chairs with ocean views. Places to sit and think and remember.\n\nAt dinner, our server asked about the occasion. My daughter explained. For the rest of the cruise, he brought me an extra chocolate dessert every night. \"For your husband,\" he said. \"Because you're thinking of him.\" I wept into my tiramisu.\n\nNassau was hard. I kept thinking \"he would have loved this.\" But also: I was there. I was seeing it. I was living the someday we'd postponed.\n\nOn the last night, I stood on the balcony watching the moonlight on the ocean. I said goodbye—not to him, but to the version of me who thought I couldn't do this without him. I'm still here. I'm still traveling. He's still with me, just differently now.\n\n**The truth:** Grief travels with you. Enchantment gave me space to carry it gently.

      "markdown": "**My twelve-year-old son discovered the bungee trampoline on day two. By day three, he was doing backflips.**\n\nEnchantment has something no other Royal Caribbean ship has: an actual bungee trampoline setup on the sports deck. You get strapped into a harness attached to bungee cords, and suddenly you're bouncing 20 feet in the air doing acrobatics you'd never attempt on a regular trampoline.\n\nJake was terrified the first time. He's athletic—plays soccer, swims competitively—but this was different. The crew member running it was patient, teaching him how to bounce, how to control his body in the air, how to land safely.\n\nHis first session lasted maybe five minutes. He came down grinning but cautious. \"I want to try again tomorrow.\"\n\nDay three, he was doing flips. Real flips. The kind where my wife grabbed my arm and said \"should we be letting him do this?\" The crew member was right there, coaching him through each move. By the end of the week, Jake was doing full backflips and front flips like he'd been training his whole life.\n\nHere's what made it special: the other kids noticed. Suddenly Jake wasn't just another kid on the cruise—he was *the kid who could do backflips on the bungee*. Other families would stop and watch. Kids would ask him for tips. He became a mini-celebrity.\n\nHe's fourteen now. Still talks about that cruise. The video of him on the bungee is still his phone's lock screen.\n\n**Practical notes:** The bungee trampoline has age/weight restrictions. Sessions book up fast—sign up early. It's free (included in cruise fare).",

      "markdown": "**I've used a power wheelchair for eight years. Cruising always seemed impossible until Enchantment.**\n\nMega-ships terrified me. Miles of hallways. Endless elevators. Crowded pool decks where I'd never fit. My husband wanted to cruise; I always said no.\n\nThen we researched Vision Class ships. Smaller. More manageable. Accessible cabins on lower decks (less travel to public areas). A friend who uses a manual chair had sailed Enchantment and said it was navigable.\n\nShe was right. Enchantment's layout made sense. Elevators were never more than a few minutes away. Hallways were wide enough for my chair. The crew knew my name by day two and always had doors open before I arrived.\n\nThe accessible cabin was properly designed—roll-in shower, grab bars, enough space to maneuver. Not perfect, but functional. Better than most hotels I've stayed in.\n\n[Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) was crowded at peak times, but going early or late meant easy navigation. The [main dining room](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) had accessible seating at the end of aisles—no climbing over chairs.\n\nCocoCay was challenging (sand + wheelchair = difficult), but I stayed aboard and had the Solarium to myself. Sometimes accessibility means choosing what works rather than fighting what doesn't.\n\nMy husband got his cruise. I got freedom I didn't expect. We've cruised twice since—always smaller ships, always Vision or Radiance class.\n\n**The truth:** Enchantment isn't perfectly accessible, but it's navigable.

      "markdown": "**We paid $89 per person per day. All-in. For a Royal Caribbean cruise.**\n\nI'll admit: I was skeptical. We'd sailed newer ships before—[Harmony](/ships/rcl/harmony-of-the-seas.html), [Symphony](/ships/rcl/symphony-of-the-seas.html)—and loved them. But those were $200+ per day. Enchantment was running a promotion for a 4-night Bahamas sailing, and at $89/day, we had to try it.\n\nI went in expecting compromises. Older ship meant older problems, right? Worn carpets. Tired crew. Mediocre food. Budget price, budget experience.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe ship is older (1997), yes. But it's been refurbished and maintained beautifully. Our cabin was small but spotless. The crew was *incredible*—genuinely happy, remembering our names after one conversation.\n\nThe [main dining room](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html#dining-card)? Outstanding. Same server every night, treating us like VIPs. The food was legitimately good—not \"good for a cruise,\" just good.\n\n[Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html) was $50 per person and rivaled $150 steakhouses on land. We splurged once and regretted nothing.\n\nHere's the secret: Enchantment is cheaper because it's older and smaller, not because it's worse. You're not paying for cutting-edge tech or 20 restaurants. You're paying for the fundamentals: clean room, good food, excellent service, beautiful destinations.\n\nAnd sometimes, that's all you need.\n\nSee our [cruise budgeting guide](/planning.html) for more tips on finding value sailings.",

We'd seen the photos: turquoise water, the tallest waterslide in North America, overwater cabanas, beach clubs. It looked incredible.\n\nBut we weren't going to pay $2,000+ for a newer ship to get there. Enchantment's 4-night Bahamas itinerary included CocoCay and cost us $700 total for two people.\n\nSame island. Same beach. Same waterslides. Same swim-up bar.\n\nThe ship you arrive on doesn't matter once you're on the island. Everyone gets off. Everyone goes to CocoCay. Whether you sailed on [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) or Enchantment, you're standing in the same impossibly clear water.\n\nWe spent the entire day on the island. Waterslides. Snorkeling. Zip-lining over the ocean. Lounging in hammocks. We didn't get back to the ship until 4pm, exhausted and sunburned and happy.\n\nEnchantment is cheaper because it's older and smaller. Save the money. Book the smaller ship. Spend the savings on island excursions. You'll have the same island experience everyone else has.\n\nFor CocoCay tips, see our [port guide](/ports.html).",

Researched Nassau's history before we sailed. Learned about the Lucayan people who first inhabited the Bahamas. Read about colonial history, pirates, Prohibition-era rum running.\n\nWalking through Nassau wasn't just tourism—it was walking through history. The Queen's Staircase, carved by slaves. Fort Charlotte, built to defend against American invasion. The Pompey Museum, telling the story of slavery in the Bahamas.\n\nOn the ship, I found unexpected education. The crew came from over 60 countries—I interviewed them about their homes, their cultures, their journeys to working at sea. A housekeeping attendant from the Philippines taught me about Tagalog. A bartender from Serbia shared stories of growing up during the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nEnchantment's size meant I saw the same crew repeatedly, built relationships, had real conversations. On mega-ships, you're anonymous. On Vision Class ships, you're a guest who becomes a familiar face.\n\nI came home with three notebooks of observations, dozens of photographs, and a reading list of books about Caribbean history. Retirement stopped being boring.\n\nThe best education happens when you're curious enough to ask questions. Enchantment gave me time and space to be curious.\n\nSee our [planning guide](/planning.html) for tips on making travel educational.",

Cabins are smaller. Dining variety is limited. The pool deck is functional, not Instagram-worthy.\n\nBut if you want *cruising*—not theme-parking at sea—Enchantment delivers. Attentive crew who remember your name. Traditional dining room with proper service. Manageable size where you can find the library, spa, or your cabin without a map.\n\nSee [other Vision-class ships](/ships.html) for similar experiences.",
