<section><h3>The Innovation Pioneer</h3><p>TSS Festivale earned her place in cruise history not through size or luxury, but through innovation. In 1981, she became the first cruise ship to feature a waterslide—a simple addition that revolutionized what passengers expected from cruise entertainment. That single slide opened the floodgates for the elaborate water parks we see on today's mega-ships.</p></section>

<section><h3>From the Logbook</h3><div id="logbook-container"><p>Loading stories...</p></div></section>
<section><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Every water park, every slide, every splash zone on modern cruise ships traces back to Festivale's pioneering spirit. She proved that cruising could be playful, that innovation didn't require new construction, and that Fun Ships meant finding new ways to deliver joy. The waterslide pioneer showed the industry that passengers wanted more than transportation—they wanted entertainment.</p></section>
