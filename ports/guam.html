    <article class="card"><h1>Guam: Where America's Day Begins</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>We docked at Apra Harbor just after sunrise and I could already smell the frangipani blooming somewhere beyond the container cranes. Guam calls itself "Where America's Day Begins" — this far west in the Pacific, we're a full day ahead of the mainland, which feels both disorienting and oddly liberating. Our first stop was the War in the Pacific National Historical Park at Asan Beach, where the turquoise lagoon looks deceptively peaceful until you walk past the Japanese coastal defense guns still aimed seaward. Standing in the shade of a palm beside a weathered pillbox, reading the names of the men who fought here in 1944, the heat and the history pressed down together.</p>

        <p>We drove north to Two Lovers Point through the lush tropical hills — the legend says two ancient Chamorro lovers leapt from this 400-foot cliff rather than be separated by their families. The viewpoint offers sweeping ocean views and the kind of silence that makes you believe the story might be true. Back in Tumon Bay by midday we found the beaches as advertised: powdery white sand, water so clear you can see your toes at chest depth, and a gentle warmth that never quite becomes oppressive. Lunch was red rice, kelaguen (spicy Chamorro chicken salad), and a cold beer at a beachfront grill where the owner told us his grandfather had hidden American soldiers during the Japanese occupation.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing before the ancient latte stones at the Plaza de España in Hagåtña, massive coral pillars shaped by Chamorro hands over a thousand years ago — still standing after typhoons, invasions, and empires, silent witnesses to 4,000 years of unbroken island memory.

        <h3>Cruise Terminal & Docking</h3>
        <p>Ships dock at the Port of Guam in Apra Harbor on the western shore, one of the finest natural deepwater harbors in the Pacific. The terminal sits about 20 minutes south of Tumon Bay's resort district and 15 minutes from the capital of Hagåtña. The harbor itself is an active US naval base — you'll see destroyers and submarines sharing the anchorage, a quiet reminder that Guam remains one of America's most strategically important territories. Taxis and tour buses meet the ships; many visitors rent cars for maximum flexibility exploring the island's scattered historical sites.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p>Guam offers a rare blend of pristine Pacific beauty, deep indigenous culture, and the profound weight of 20th-century history.</p>

        <h4>War in the Pacific National Historical Park</h4>
        <p>This isn't a single site — it's seven distinct units spread across Guam preserving the American liberation of 1944. The Asan Beach Unit features the main Visitor Center, beach landing sites, and hilltop gun emplacements. Walking the coastal trail you'll pass Japanese pillboxes, American artillery positions, and interpretive signs explaining the brutal 21-day battle. It's sobering, necessary, and beautifully maintained. Plan at least 2–3 hours if you want to absorb the history properly.</p>

        <h4>Two Lovers Point (Puntan Dos Amantes)</h4>
        <p>The clifftop viewpoint rises 400 feet above the Philippine Sea and offers panoramic views of Tumon Bay and the northern coastline. The Chamorro legend tells of forbidden love and tragic sacrifice — the kind of story every culture knows but each tells in its own way. There's a small admission fee, a bell you can ring for good luck, and photo opportunities that justify the drive. Go in the late afternoon when the light turns golden and the tour buses have cleared out.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
        <img src="img/guam/guam-2.webp" alt="Guam waterfront" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Guam scenery — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Guam&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <h4>Tumon Bay Beach & Water Sports</h4>
        <p>This crescent-shaped beach is Guam's main tourist strip — resorts, restaurants, duty-free shopping, and the kind of turquoise water that looks Photoshopped until you wade in. The bay is protected by a reef, so the swimming is gentle and safe. Snorkeling is excellent along the reef edges, and dive shops offer everything from beginner courses to advanced wreck dives on sunken Japanese freighters. If you only have an afternoon, Tumon delivers the classic tropical beach experience without complications.</p>

        <h4>Latte Stone Park & Chamorro Village</h4>
        <p>In Hagåtña you'll find ancient latte stones — massive coral pillars topped with hemispherical capstones, the architectural signature of the Chamorro people who've lived here for over 4,000 years. These aren't replicas; they're the real foundation stones of ancient houses and meeting halls, relocated and preserved. Nearby, the Chamorro Village comes alive Wednesday nights for the weekly market — local food, live music, handicrafts, and the best kelaguen you'll taste anywhere. It's touristy, yes, but also genuinely cultural and worth your time.</p>

        <h4>Fort Nuestra Señora de la Soledad</h4>
        <p>The Spanish colonial ruins at Umatac Bay mark Guam's 17th-century history under Spanish rule. The fort overlooks the bay where Magellan first landed in 1521, a moment that changed the Pacific forever. The site is small, partly restored, and offers a quiet counterpoint to the WWII history that dominates most tours. It's a 30-minute drive south but pairs well with nearby beaches and a stop at the scenic overlook above Cetti Bay.</p>

        <h4>Diving the WWII Wrecks</h4>
        <p>Guam's underwater world rivals its topside attractions. The SMS Cormoran (a WWI German wreck) and the Tokai Maru (a WWII Japanese freighter) lie together in Apra Harbor — two wars, two ships, one dive site. Visibility averages 80–100 feet, water temperature stays near 80°F year-round, and the marine life is abundant. If you're certified, this is a bucket-list dive. If you're not, shore snorkeling at Piti Bomb Holes Marine Preserve offers colorful coral and tropical fish in crystal-clear shallows.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around</h3>
        <p>Guam has no public transit system worth planning around — taxis, rental cars, and tour buses are your main options. Taxi fares are fixed by law: around $25–30 from the port to Tumon Bay, $15–20 to Hagåtña. Rental cars are widely available and roads are in good condition; driving is on the right side, signs are in English, and distances are manageable. Many cruise visitors book island tours through their ship, which handle transportation and hit the major sites efficiently. If you want to explore independently, a rental car gives you the freedom to linger at quieter beaches and historical sites off the beaten path.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
        <p>Chamorro cuisine blends indigenous, Spanish, Filipino, and American influences into something uniquely Guamanian. <strong>Red rice</strong> (tinaktak) gets its color and flavor from achote seeds. <strong>Kelaguen</strong> is a spicy salad made with grilled chicken, seafood, or venison, mixed with lemon juice, coconut, and hot peppers — refreshing, tangy, and addictive. <strong>BBQ short ribs</strong> appear on nearly every menu, often marinated in soy, garlic, and sugar, then grilled over charcoal.</p>

        <p>For dessert, try <strong>latiya</strong>, a custard cake topped with cinnamon and sugar, or <strong>apigigi</strong>, coconut and tapioca steamed in banana leaves. Local beer options include the easy-drinking Guam Brewery lagers, while fresh coconut water and <strong>buko juice</strong> (young coconut) provide natural refreshment in the tropical heat. Wednesday's Chamorro Village Night Market is the best place to sample everything in one lively, affordable setting.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p>Guam's tropical climate means heat and humidity year-round. Bring sunscreen, a hat, and plenty of water. Sudden rain showers are common, but they're brief and warm. Respect is expected at WWII memorials and Chamorro cultural sites — these aren't just tourist attractions, they're sacred ground.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency & Payments:</strong> US dollar. Credit cards widely accepted. No passport required for US citizens, but bring ID.</p>

        <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> Standard US practice applies: 15–20% at restaurants, $1–2 per bag for hotel porters, 10–15% for taxi drivers.</p>

        <p><strong>Language:</strong> English and Chamorro are official languages; English is universally spoken. A few Chamorro phrases are appreciated: "Håfa adai" (hello), "Si Yu'os ma'åse" (thank you).</p>

        <p><strong>Duty-Free Shopping:</strong> Guam's duty-free status makes it a shopping destination for designer goods, electronics, and cosmetics. The DFS Galleria and Tumon Sands Plaza offer the biggest selections.</p>

        <p><strong>Emergency Services:</strong> Dial 911. Guam Memorial Hospital is in Tamuning, about 10 minutes from Tumon Bay.</p>
