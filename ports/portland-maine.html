        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Portland, Maine is lobster rolls that drip butter, Portland Head Light standing sentry since 1791, cobblestone Old Port streets, and craft breweries that perfected the Northeast IPA.

      <h1>Portland, Maine: Lighthouse Keeper's Dream</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>We walked off the ship straight into the most photogenic working waterfront in America. Portland Head Light is fifteen minutes away in Cape Elizabeth, and we stood there watching waves crash against the rocks below the oldest lighthouse in Maine. The keeper's house museum had us nerding out over Fresnel lenses and 19th-century logbooks.</p>

        <p>We took the trolley back to the Old Port and got lost in cobblestone streets lined with brick warehouses converted into art galleries and boutiques. We had lunch at Eventide Oyster Co. – brown butter lobster roll on a steamed bun that made us rethink every lobster roll we'd ever eaten. The line at Allagash Brewing Company tasting room moved fast, and we walked out with a growler of their Belgian-style white ale.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon we went to the Portland Museum of Art to see Winslow Homer's seascapes – living in Portland shaped his entire artistic vision, and standing in front of his storm-tossed waves felt like seeing Maine's soul painted on canvas. We had coffee at Tandem Coffee Roasters, wandered through the Eastern Promenade with Casco Bay spread out before us, and caught sunset from the working waterfront watching lobster boats come home.</p>

        <p>We grabbed Holy Donut (potato donuts – trust us) for dessert and walked the waterfront one more time. Portland feels like a city that never sold out – still working, still fishing, still making art and beer and serving lobster rolls that taste like they came straight from the trap an hour ago.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at the base of Portland Head Light at golden hour, watching the keeper climb the spiral stairs to light the beacon. That lighthouse has guided ships home since George Washington commissioned it, and for one moment we understood what it means to be a lighthouse keeper – the loneliness, the duty, the privilege of standing watch over sailors' lives. The beam swept across the water, and we felt the weight of 230 years of faithful service.
        </div>

        <p>We sailed away past a dozen islands dotting Casco Bay, each with its own lighthouse winking in the dusk. Portland gave us New England at its finest – hardworking, beautiful, unpretentious, and generous with butter.</p>

        <h3>Getting Around Portland, Maine</h3>
        <p>The cruise port is right downtown at the Ocean Gateway Terminal on Commercial Street. The Old Port district is walkable from the ship (5-10 minutes). Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth is 4 miles away – take a taxi, Uber, or the Greater Portland Metro bus Route 1 (seasonal). The Portland Explorer trolley runs a hop-on/hop-off loop connecting major attractions. Most visitors stay within the peninsula and walk – Portland is compact, charming, and pedestrian-friendly. Rent bikes to explore the Eastern Promenade Trail along Casco Bay.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="port-section">
        <h3>A Word to the Wise</h3>
        <p>Lobster roll prices vary wildly – some spots charge tourist rates while locals know where to find the good deals. Ask at the ship's information desk or check online reviews. Portland Head Light gets crowded midday during cruise ship calls – go early morning or late afternoon for the best photos and smallest crowds. Many craft breweries don't serve food, so eat first or bring snacks. Parking at the lighthouse is limited and fills fast. Weather changes quickly in Maine – bring layers even in summer, and waterproof shoes if you're exploring rocky shorelines.</p>

        <h3>Portland, Maine FAQ</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>What's the best lobster roll in Portland?</summary>
          <p>Eventide Oyster Co.'s brown butter lobster roll on a steamed bun is legendary, but expect a wait. Luke's Lobster on Middle Street serves classic cold lobster rolls with just mayo and lemon. DiMillo's on the waterfront offers harbor views with your roll. For a local secret, grab one at the Portland Lobster Company right on the working pier – no frills, just fresh lobster.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I visit Portland Head Light independently?</summary>
          <p>Yes, it's very accessible. Take a taxi or rideshare (15-20 minutes from the port), or use Greater Portland Metro bus Route 1 in summer months. The lighthouse grounds and Fort Williams Park are free to explore. The museum inside the former keeper's quarters charges a small admission. You can't climb the lighthouse itself (it's an active Coast Guard light), but the grounds offer spectacular views and photo opportunities from every angle.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What's the craft beer scene like?</summary>
          <p>Portland has more breweries per capita than almost any U.S. city. Allagash is the most famous (Belgian-styles, free tours, tasting room). Bissell Brothers makes hazy New England IPAs. Austin Street, Foundation, and Battery Steele are all within walking distance of the Old Port. Most offer flights so you can sample multiple styles. Novare Res Bier Cafe downtown has 500+ craft beers if you want variety under one roof.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is Portland walkable from the cruise ship?</summary>
          <p>Extremely walkable. The Ocean Gateway Terminal drops you on Commercial Street, and the cobblestoned Old Port is a 5-minute stroll. The waterfront, shops, restaurants, museums, and Eastern Promenade are all within a 20-minute walk. Portland Head Light and the breweries in the Bayside neighborhood require transportation, but the core of Portland is one of the most walkable cruise ports in North America. Wear comfortable shoes for cobblestones and hills.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; line-height: 1.6;">I've cruised solo dozens of times, chasing lighthouses and lobster rolls up and down the New England coast. Portland's working waterfront and honest food scene remind me why I keep coming back to these waters.</p>
