          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I've lost count of how many times I've visited Perfect Day at CocoCay now—six? seven?—but I remember the first time with crystal clarity. It was 2019, just months after Royal Caribbean's $250 million transformation was complete, and I was sailing on Mariner of the Seas out of Miami. The moment we rounded the island and I saw those impossibly turquoise waters and the towering waterslides of Thrill Waterpark rising against the sky, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I'd been to plenty of private islands before, but nothing prepared me for this.</p>

            <p>The ship docked directly at the pier—no tenders, no waiting, just walk off and you're there. That alone sets CocoCay apart from most Caribbean ports. Within minutes I had my toes in the sand at Chill Island, a complimentary Coco Loco in hand, staring at water so clear I could see fish swimming twenty feet out. The taste of salt lingered on my lips as the morning breeze carried the scent of tropical flowers across the beach. The beaches are immaculate—raked daily, with free loungers and umbrellas scattered across multiple zones so you never feel crowded even on two-ship days.</p>

            <p>But let me tell you about Thrill Waterpark, because it's the headline attraction for good reason. I'm not normally a waterpark person, but when you're standing at the top of Daredevil's Peak—135 feet up, the tallest waterslide in North America—looking out over the entire island with your heart pounding, you realize Royal Caribbean wasn't messing around with this investment. The drop slide is pure adrenaline, but my personal favorite is the Dueling Demons mat racers where you and three friends can compete side by side. The wave pool is massive and legitimate, and kids under a certain age have entire aqua playgrounds to themselves. We spent four hours in Thrill Waterpark on my last visit and still didn't do everything.</p>

            <p>Oasis Lagoon deserves its own paragraph because it's genuinely incredible—the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean, they claim, and I believe it. It's massive. There's a swim-up bar, floating loungers, a DJ playing poolside, and multiple depth zones so families can share the space safely. I've spent entire port days just here without touching the beach, and that says something. The Coco Beach Club infinity pool is even more luxurious if you book that experience—overwater cabanas, dedicated servers, upscale lunch included—but Oasis Lagoon is free and fantastic.</p>

            <p>The food situation has improved dramatically since the early days. Skipper's Grill serves legitimately good BBQ—the ribs disappear fast at lunch, so go early. Chill Grill covers burgers, hot dogs, and all the sides you'd expect. It's all complimentary. Snack Shack has pizza and chicken tenders for picky eaters. If you upgrade to Coco Beach Club, the dining there is a significant step up—think resort-quality with table service. I've done both, and honestly, the free BBQ with a beach view is pretty hard to beat for value.</p>

            <p>What I appreciate most about CocoCay is that it respects your time. There are no aggressive vendors, no hassle, no stress about getting back to the ship on time. Everything is within a 15-minute walk or a quick free tram ride. The paths are wide and flat and stroller-friendly. The signage is excellent. The app map actually works. You can be as active or as lazy as you want, and either choice feels like the right one. I've done full-on waterpark days and I've done "plant myself in a hammock and don't move for six hours" days, and both were perfect.</p>

            <p>The one thing I'd change? More shaded spots on the main beaches. On very sunny days, the prime shaded loungers get claimed early. But that's what cabana rentals are for, and even the basic cabanas (much cheaper than Coco Beach Club) give you a guaranteed comfortable base. Or just head to South Beach or Chill Island early—plenty of palm trees.</p>

            <p>The newer additions have only made things better. Hideaway opened as an adults-only area with its own pool, quieter vibe, and dedicated bar—perfect if you're cruising without kids and want guaranteed peace. Up, Up and Away, the helium balloon that takes you 450 feet above the island, offers the most incredible views and a completely unique perspective on the whole operation. The zip line across the island is solid fun—1,600 feet long—though not as insane as the one at Labadee.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> It was late afternoon on my third visit, floating in Oasis Lagoon with my wife, swim-up bar cocktails in hand, watching the sun start to paint the sky orange behind our ship docked at the pier. A steel drum band was playing somewhere in the distance. The scent of tropical flowers drifted on the breeze. Neither of us said anything for the longest time—we didn't need to. My eyes filled with unexpected tears of gratitude—not sad tears, but the kind that come when you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be, with exactly the person you're supposed to be with. My heart swelled with appreciation for this simple moment of shared peace. That's when I understood what Royal Caribbean was really selling here: not just a private island, but the closest thing to perfection a single day can hold.</p>

            <p>Looking back, CocoCay has taught me that sometimes the manufactured experience can still deliver genuine emotion. This is a place designed down to the last detail, yet that sunset moment in the lagoon was as real as any I've had in authentically remote places. Perhaps that's the lesson—that joy isn't less valid because someone planned for it. Royal Caribbean built a stage, but the performance is yours.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Perfect Day at CocoCay is Royal Caribbean's private island in the Berry Islands chain of the Bahamas, about 55 miles northwest of Nassau. Ships dock directly at a purpose-built pier—no tender boats required, which is a significant advantage over many private island destinations. You simply walk off the gangway and you're on the island within minutes, ready to start your day.</p>

            <p>The arrival plaza features shops, restrooms, towel exchange stations, and information boards showing the day's activities and tram schedules. Everything is clearly signed. Free trams run continuously to transport guests to farther areas like Hideaway or the waterpark, though walking is pleasant along wide, flat paths. The island has been designed with accessibility in mind—most areas are wheelchair and stroller accessible, with beach wheelchairs available at no charge.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>CocoCay is one of the easiest ports you'll ever navigate. Everything is connected by wide, flat paved paths, and free trams run constantly throughout the day to transport guests between areas. The island is compact enough that walking is always an option, but the trams are convenient for reaching farther areas like Hideaway or Thrill Waterpark.</p>

            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> From pier to Thrill Waterpark takes 5-10 minutes. From pier to Oasis Lagoon is 7-8 minutes. From pier to Chill Island beaches is 10-12 minutes. From pier to Hideaway (farthest point) is about 15 minutes or 5 by tram. All paths are flat, paved, and stroller-friendly. Signage is excellent throughout.</p>

            <p><strong>By tram:</strong> Air-conditioned trams run continuously on a loop stopping at all major areas. No tickets needed—just hop on. Tram stops are clearly marked. Wait times rarely exceed 5 minutes during operating hours. This is the best option for mobility-limited guests or on very hot days.</p>

            <p><strong>Mobility considerations:</strong> CocoCay is one of the most accessible private islands in cruising. Wide paths, flat terrain, and beach wheelchairs (available free at the towel stations) make navigation straightforward. Oasis Lagoon has graduated entry. Low-stamina visitors can enjoy the beaches, pool, and complimentary food without significant walking. The trams provide easy transport for those who prefer not to walk. Thrill Waterpark involves stairs and is not accessible for wheelchair users, but Oasis Lagoon and all beach areas are.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Unlike traditional ports, CocoCay's "excursions" are really add-on experiences rather than tours. Many guests enjoy the island using only the complimentary inclusions—beaches, Oasis Lagoon pool, loungers, food, and trams. However, the paid upgrades can significantly enhance your day if budget allows. Book ahead through the Royal Caribbean Cruise Planner app for best pricing and availability—popular options sell out before sailing.</p>

            <h3>Thrill Waterpark Day Pass</h3>
            <p>North America's tallest waterslides await at Thrill Waterpark. The headline is Daredevil's Peak—a 135-foot drop slide that's genuinely thrilling. Also includes Dueling Demons mat racers, Screeching Serpent tube slide, Splash Summit with multiple slide towers, a massive wave pool, and Splash Pad for younger children. Ship excursion booking runs $50-65 per person. Independent visitors can purchase at the park, but prices are higher and popular days sell out. This is the must-do for thrill seekers and families with older children. Moderate to high stamina required—lots of stairs. Height requirements: 42-48 inches depending on slide. Guaranteed return not an issue since you're on a private island. Book ahead for best pricing.</p>

            <h3>Coco Beach Club</h3>
            <p>The ultimate CocoCay experience features overwater cabanas, an infinity pool overlooking the ocean, premium beach access, and an upscale restaurant serving dishes like filet mignon and lobster—all included with your day pass. Ship excursion pricing runs $90-120 per person. This is independent booking only (through Cruise Planner)—no ship-escorted version exists since you're on the island. Perfect for couples or those wanting a quieter, more refined experience. Low stamina suitable—relax all day. Book ahead as cabanas sell out weeks in advance.</p>

            <h3>Hideaway Adults-Only Day Pass</h3>
            <p>Opened in 2024, Hideaway is CocoCay's adults-only (18+) escape featuring five bars including a swim-up bar, two complimentary dining venues, a temperature-controlled infinity pool, and a much quieter atmosphere than the main island. Ship excursion booking runs $35-45 per person—one of the best values for couples seeking peace. No guaranteed return concerns on a private island. Low stamina required—this is all about relaxation. Book ahead through Cruise Planner as access is limited to approximately 2,000 guests per day.</p>

            <h3>Up, Up and Away Helium Balloon</h3>
            <p>Rise 450 feet above the island in a tethered helium balloon for panoramic views of CocoCay, the ship, and the surrounding Bahamas waters. Ship excursion pricing runs $40-50 per person for approximately 10 minutes aloft. This is an independent booking through Cruise Planner. Low stamina required—you simply stand in the basket. Best visibility in morning; best light in late afternoon. Book ahead if you want specific timing; walk-up availability varies.</p>

            <h3>Zip Line Experience</h3>
            <p>Soar 1,600 feet across the island at heights up to 60 feet on CocoCay's zip line. Ship excursion pricing runs $35-45 per person. Independent booking through Cruise Planner or at the island activity desk. Moderate stamina required—you'll climb stairs to the platform. Weight and age restrictions apply. No guaranteed return concerns on private island. Book ahead for popular time periods.</p>

            <h3>Beach Cabana Rentals</h3>
            <p>Reserve a shaded cabana for your group with guaranteed seating, locked storage, and server service for drinks and food. Various sizes and locations available. Ship excursion pricing runs $200-800 depending on size and location. Book through Cruise Planner well ahead—popular dates sell out. Low stamina required—your cabana becomes home base. Perfect for families wanting a guaranteed shaded spot or groups wanting to stay together. This is independent booking only.</p>

          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Before Royal Caribbean's transformation, this island was known as Little Stirrup Cay—a modest private island that Norwegian Cruise Line purchased in the 1970s as one of the first dedicated cruise destinations. Royal Caribbean acquired it in 1988 when they purchased Admiral Cruises, and for decades it operated as a simple beach stop: passengers tendered ashore, enjoyed the natural beaches, grabbed some BBQ, and returned to ship. Pleasant enough, but unremarkable.</p>

            <p>The transformation began in earnest in 2009 when Royal Caribbean built a deep-water pier, eliminating tender operations entirely. But the real change came between 2016 and 2019 when Royal Caribbean invested $250 million in what they called the "Perfect Day" project. They built Thrill Waterpark from scratch, constructing North America's tallest waterslide on an island where the highest previous point was a palm tree. They created Oasis Lagoon—the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean—with swim-up bars and floating cabanas. The beaches were redesigned, dining venues expanded, and an entire entertainment infrastructure emerged from the sand.</p>

            <p>The island reopened as Perfect Day at CocoCay in May 2019 to immediate success. By 2023, the island was welcoming 2.5 million visitors annually—more than many Caribbean nations see in total tourism. Royal Caribbean projects that number will reach 3.5 million by 2025. The Hideaway adults-only expansion opened in January 2024, proving the company isn't done investing. What started as Norwegian's modest beach experiment has become the gold standard for what a private cruise island can be—and the template others now try to match.</p>

              <p>Disembark before 10am. Oasis Lagoon's shaded spots fill up first, followed by prime beach locations at Chill Island. Alternatively, book a cabana for guaranteed shade all day.</p>
