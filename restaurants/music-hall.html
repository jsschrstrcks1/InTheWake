      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Timing: Early evening (9–10 PM) · Duration: ~45 minutes</p>
      <p>The evening typically kicks off with crowd-pleasing classic rock — think Journey, Bon Jovi, Queen, and AC/DC. The house bands nail these songs with impressive musicianship, and it's not uncommon to see the entire venue singing along to "Don't Stop Believin'" or "Livin' on a Prayer."</p>

        <p>"The house band at Music Hall was phenomenal. They opened with 'Sweet Child O' Mine' and the crowd went wild. These musicians are seriously talented — the guitarist shredded every solo perfectly. By the third song, everyone was on their feet."</p>

      <h3>Music Hall Review: The Ship's Best-Kept Secret</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> I'll be honest — I almost skipped Music Hall. "House band" didn't sound exciting. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. By the end of our cruise, Music Hall was our nightly destination, and the band felt like friends we'd made at sea.</p>

      <h4>The Musicians</h4>
      <p>Royal Caribbean clearly hires exceptional talent for these venues. Our cruise featured a five-piece band that could authentically cover everything from Hendrix to Taylor Swift. The lead guitarist was genuinely impressive — I've seen lesser players headline clubs on land. The vocalist had incredible range and stage presence. These aren't background musicians; they're performers who engage the crowd and clearly love what they do.</p>

      <h4>The Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Music Hall has the feel of an intimate concert venue. The lighting is excellent — proper stage lighting that adds to the performance without being overwhelming. The sound system is well-calibrated; loud enough to feel like a concert, but you can still have a conversation at the bar. The mix of seating and standing areas means you can choose your experience each night.</p>

      <h4>The Crowd</h4>
      <p>What surprised me most was the community that formed. By the third night, we recognized regulars. People who'd been strangers were dancing together, singing along, sharing tables. There's something about live music that breaks down social barriers. We met a couple from Texas during a country set and ended up having dinner with them the next night.</p>

      <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Go early on the first night to scout your preferred spot</li>
        <li>Request songs — the band takes requests and often delivers</li>
        <li>Don't skip country night even if it's not your genre</li>
        <li>The late-night dance sets are worth staying up for</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Music Hall became the highlight of our evenings. It's free, it's fun, and the talent level is genuinely impressive. <strong>Rating: 4.5/5.</strong> If you're on a ship with Music Hall, don't make my initial mistake of dismissing it. Give it one night — you'll probably be back every night after.</p>
