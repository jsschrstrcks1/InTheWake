          <h2>My Logbook: The Caribbean's Underwater Cathedral</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've lost count of how many times I've visited Cozumel on cruise ships — it's on nearly every Western Caribbean itinerary, so if you cruise out of Galveston, Tampa, or Fort Lauderdale with any regularity, you know this island intimately. And yet I still look forward to it every single time. Cozumel was my first real introduction to snorkeling in truly world-class water, my first time eating tacos al pastor from a street cart while mariachi played in the square, and my first understanding of why the ancient Maya chose this place as sacred.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/cozumel/cozumel-fom-2.webp" alt="Crystal clear turquoise Caribbean waters of Cozumel coastline with pristine visibility" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Cozumel's famous crystal-clear waters — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The island's name itself whispers its history — "Cuzamil" in the Mayan language means "Land of Swallows," named for the migratory birds that once darkened the skies each season. The Maya flourished here from around 300 AD until Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 1500s, disrupting a pilgrimage tradition that had brought women from across the Yucatan to worship Ixchel, the goddess of fertility, medicine, and the moon. The temple complex at San Gervasio was connected by sacbés — the ancient Maya's raised white roads that linked sacred sites across the Yucatan Peninsula — and walking them today, overgrown and half-hidden by jungle, fills me with a strange reverence for the countless pilgrims who walked them before me.</p>

            <p>After the Maya civilization declined, Cozumel fell quiet enough that pirates found it a perfect hideout through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries — I sometimes wonder if I'm walking the same beach paths that Henry Morgan used. In the early twentieth century, Cozumel boomed again when chicle harvesters arrived to tap the sapodilla trees for chewing gum, turning sleepy fishing villages into export centers. But it was Jacques Cousteau who truly put Cozumel on the world map — his 1961 documentary on Palancar Reef declared it one of the most beautiful dive sites on earth, and the rest is history. The island has been welcoming underwater pilgrims ever since, drawn by the same crystalline waters that Cousteau called the world's best diving.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/cozumel/cozumel-fom-3.webp" alt="Stunning underwater reef colors of Cozumel showing vibrant coral formations" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Reef colors that defy photography — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The snorkeling and diving here are legitimately exceptional. Cozumel sits on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef — the second-largest reef system on earth — and the visibility often exceeds 100 feet. On a good day, the water is so clear it's almost disorienting; you can see the sandy bottom 60 feet down and it looks close enough to touch. I've done the ship excursions to Palancar Reef and Colombia Reef more times than I can count, and every single time I'm surrounded by sea turtles, eagle rays, nurse sharks, and fish in colors I didn't know existed. The drift dives here are famous — you literally float with the current past coral canyons and swim-throughs without kicking, like flying through an underwater dream.</p>

            <p>Beach clubs are a major part of the Cozumel experience, and I've done most of them. <strong>Paradise Beach</strong> is probably my favorite for families — big pool, water toys, jet skis, and a lively atmosphere without being overwhelming. <strong>Mr. Sanchos</strong> is the all-inclusive option with unlimited food and drinks, pool floats, and a lively atmosphere that some people love and others find too busy. <strong>Nachi Cocom</strong> limits daily guests so it's quieter and more relaxed — great for couples. <strong>Playa Mia</strong> is like a waterpark with slides and trampolines. All of them have taxi service from the cruise piers for $8–15 round trip, and most offer packages that include food, drinks, and use of facilities for $50–80 per person. Worth every penny for a relaxed beach day.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> It was maybe my tenth visit to Cozumel, and I'd signed up for a small-group snorkel tour that included a stop at El Cielo — "The Starfish Sandbar." The boat anchored in this knee-deep turquoise lagoon with white sand so bright it hurt, and as I slid off the side and my feet touched bottom, I looked down and saw them: dozens of orange starfish scattered across the sand like someone had decorated the seafloor for a party. The guide explained that we could look but not touch (the oils from our hands can harm them), and so I just floated there on my back, the sun warm on my face and these ancient creatures beneath me, and felt something I rarely feel on busy cruise port days — complete stillness. Everyone in the group went quiet. For ten minutes we just existed in that perfect shallow water with the starfish and the silence and the improbable beauty of it all. Cozumel has given me adrenaline and adventure on a hundred visits, but that morning at El Cielo gave me peace.
            </div>

            <p>But I don't want to undersell the cultural side, because Cozumel has real depth beyond the reef and the beach clubs. The <strong>San Gervasio ruins</strong> in the island's interior were the most important pilgrimage destination in the Maya world for women seeking Ixchel's blessing. Walking through the temple complex where countless Maya women once journeyed by canoe from the mainland fills me with a strange reverence. The ruins aren't as dramatic as Tulum or Chichén Itzá, but they're peaceful, uncrowded, and genuinely atmospheric. Entry fee is around $12 USD. For food, downtown San Miguel has fantastic options beyond the tourist-trap waterfront. I always hit <strong>Buccanos at Night</strong> for elevated Mexican seafood, <strong>La Cocay</strong> for upscale fusion, or one of the taco stands in the market for al pastor that costs $2 and changes your life.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/cozumel/cozumel-fom-4.webp" alt="Cozumel coastal scenery showing vibrant Caribbean blues and tropical vegetation" loading="lazy"/>

            </figure>

            <p>Cozumel rewards both relaxation and exploration. I've had perfect days doing nothing but floating in Mr. Sanchos' pool with a margarita, and I've had perfect days snorkeling three reefs and touring ruins and eating street food. The island accommodates both equally well. And that water — that ridiculous, impossibly clear, every-shade-of-blue-at-once water — is why I keep coming back even when I've checked every other box on the list. It's the Caribbean's most visited cruise port for good reason.</p>

        <!-- CRUISE PORT SECTION -->
        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Cozumel operates three cruise terminals, and where your ship docks significantly affects your day. <strong>Punta Langosta Pier</strong> is the ideal berth — you walk directly into downtown San Miguel via covered pedestrian bridge, surrounded by shops and restaurants. Disney, Norwegian, and MSC typically dock here. No taxi needed unless heading to beaches or distant attractions.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">
            <img src="/ports/img/cozumel/beach-fishing-boats.webp" alt="Traditional Mexican fishing boats on Cozumel beach with turquoise Caribbean waters" loading="lazy"/>
            <figcaption>Local fishing boats remind you Cozumel is still a working island — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p><strong>International Pier (SSA)</strong> hosts Royal Caribbean and Celebrity, located about 3 miles south of downtown. Budget $8-10 for taxi to San Miguel, or it's approximately 30-45 minutes walking along the waterfront. <strong>Puerta Maya Terminal</strong> serves primarily Carnival ships, positioned just beyond the International Pier with similar distance and transportation options. During peak season when all three piers are occupied, additional ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to shore, adding 20-30 minutes to your day.</p>

          <p>The port areas are accessible for wheelchair users and those with mobility challenges, though the cobblestone streets of downtown San Miguel can be uneven. Most beach clubs and major attractions can accommodate mobility needs with advance notice. Currency is Mexican Peso, though US dollars are accepted everywhere in tourist areas (you'll get better value paying in pesos). ATMs are available throughout downtown for local currency.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis ($8-15 to most destinations):</strong> Abundant at all three cruise terminals — Punta Langosta downtown, International Pier in the middle, and Puerta Maya at the south end. Meters aren't used, so always settle the fare before climbing in. Most drivers carry official rate cards. Figure $8-10 to San Miguel from the southern piers, $15-25 to beach clubs or attractions on the island's south end.</li>
            <li><strong>Car/Scooter Rentals ($25-50/day):</strong> Available near all terminals for independent exploration. Cozumel's main road forms a simple loop around the island, making navigation straightforward even for first-timers. Scooters are popular for couples without luggage; cars recommended for families or those wanting air conditioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Beach Club Shuttles:</strong> Most beach clubs provide complimentary or low-cost ($5-10) pickup at all cruise piers as part of their packages. Book ahead during peak season to guarantee transport and avoid disappointment.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown San Miguel is wonderfully pedestrian-friendly once you arrive. From Punta Langosta you can explore the entire commercial district on foot. The 3-mile walk from southern piers to downtown is doable along the scenic waterfront, but allow 45 minutes and bring water.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry to Playa del Carmen ($15-20 USD):</strong> Departs from downtown San Miguel for mainland excursions to Tulum or Playa del Carmen. Purchase one-way tickets rather than round-trip in case your plans change during the day.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- BEACHES SECTION -->
        <section class="port-section" id="beaches">
          <h2>Beaches &amp; Beach Clubs</h2>
          <p>Cozumel's beach clubs are a defining part of the port experience, offering all-inclusive packages that include chairs, pools, food, drinks, and water activities. Most range from $50-80 per person for a full day of beach bliss. Here are the top options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Paradise Beach ($50-70):</strong> Best for families — big pool, water toys, jet skis, snorkel gear, and lively atmosphere without being overwhelming. Good food, fair drinks, friendly staff. My go-to recommendation for first-timers.</li>
            <li><strong>Mr. Sanchos ($65-85 all-inclusive):</strong> The party option — unlimited food and drinks, pool floats, beach chairs, and high energy. Some find it too busy; others love the atmosphere. Popular with groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Nachi Cocom ($55-75):</strong> Limits daily guests for a quieter, more exclusive experience. Great for couples seeking relaxation over activity. Excellent service, premium feel.</li>
            <li><strong>Playa Mia ($60-90):</strong> Waterpark vibe with slides, trampolines, floating obstacles. Best for families with kids who need constant activity. More theme park than beach retreat.</li>
            <li><strong>Chankanaab National Park ($25-35 entry):</strong> Eco-park rather than beach club — snorkeling lagoon, botanical gardens, dolphin encounters (extra fee). Lower-key option with natural focus.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All beach clubs offer taxi pickup from cruise piers ($8-15 round trip) or shuttle service included in packages. Book ahead during peak season to guarantee spots — walk-ups sometimes turned away on busy days.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- EXCURSIONS SECTION -->
        <section class="port-section" id="excursions">
          <h2>Top Excursions &amp; Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Ship excursions offer guaranteed return to the vessel but cost more. Independent bookings are cheaper but carry risk of missing all-aboard if transportation delays occur. For distant attractions like Tulum, book ahead through ship or reputable independent operator. Beach clubs can be booked directly — most offer online reservations.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Snorkeling the Legendary Reefs</h4>
          <p>UNMISSABLE. Palancar Reef and Colombia Reef are world-class dive sites on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (second-largest on earth). Visibility frequently exceeds 100 feet. You'll see sea turtles, eagle rays, nurse sharks, and incredible coral formations. Jacques Cousteau declared these the world's best diving waters in 1961. Ship excursion snorkel trips run $50-80; independent boat tours from $35-50. The drift snorkeling experience — floating effortlessly with the current past coral canyons — is genuinely magical.</p>

          </figure>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">El Cielo (Starfish Sandbar)</h4>
          <p>Knee-deep turquoise lagoon with white sand where dozens of orange cushion starfish rest on the seafloor. Surreal, peaceful, unforgettable. Look but don't touch — oils from human hands harm them. Usually included in snorkel excursions or accessible via boat tour ($40-60).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">San Gervasio Mayan Ruins ($12 entry)</h4>
          <p>The largest Mayan archaeological site on Cozumel — most important pilgrimage destination in the Maya world for women seeking blessings from Ixchel, goddess of fertility. Structures date from 300-1500 AD, connected by remnants of ancient sacbé roads. Peaceful, uncrowded, atmospheric. Located in the island's interior, 45 minutes from port. Independent taxi runs $50-60 round trip with wait time; ship excursion combines with other stops for $70-90.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Punta Sur Eco Beach Park ($16 entry)</h4>
          <p>2,500-acre ecological reserve at Cozumel's southern tip — windswept beaches, mangrove lagoons with crocodiles, sea turtle nesting sites, and the historic Celarain Lighthouse with maritime museum. Wild and beautiful, feels like a different island. Accessible via rental car or taxi ($40-50 round trip).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tulum Day Trip (full day)</h4>
          <p>Clifftop Mayan ruins overlooking the Caribbean — dramatic and photogenic. Requires ferry to Playa del Carmen ($15-20 round trip) plus 1-hour drive each way. Long day but worthwhile if you've never seen Tulum. Ship excursion guarantees return ($150-200); independent tour with transportation can run $80-120. Book ahead for guaranteed return peace of mind. Allow 8+ hours total.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Downtown San Miguel</h4>
          <p>Free to explore. Waterfront malecon, central plaza with mariachi, <strong>Cozumel Museum</strong> (free admission — surprisingly excellent), shopping for silver jewelry and Mexican crafts, authentic taquerias. The real Mexico beyond the tourist zone. Walk from Punta Langosta or taxi from southern piers ($8-10).</p>

        <!-- FOOD & DINING -->
        <section class="port-section" id="food">
          <h2>Food &amp; Dining</h2>
          <p>Cozumel offers everything from $2 street tacos to upscale Mexican-Caribbean fusion. Beyond the tourist-trap waterfront, downtown San Miguel hides genuinely excellent food:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Buccanos at Night ($30-50/person):</strong> Elevated Mexican seafood with beach setting. Fresh ceviche, grilled catch of the day, creative cocktails. Reservations recommended for dinner.</li>
            <li><strong>La Cocay ($25-45/person):</strong> Upscale fusion in a garden courtyard. Creative dishes blending Mexican and international influences. Romantic setting, excellent for special occasions.</li>
            <li><strong>Taco stands in the market ($2-5):</strong> Life-changing al pastor, carnitas, and cochinita pibil. Follow the locals to small stands around the central market. Cash only, Spanish helpful but not required.</li>
            <li><strong>Casa Denis ($12-25/person):</strong> Historic restaurant since 1945 on the main plaza. Traditional Yucatecan cuisine — poc chuc, papadzules, sopa de lima. Tourist-friendly but authentic.</li>
            <li><strong>Beach club food (included in package):</strong> Quality varies — Mr. Sanchos and Paradise Beach have decent buffets; Nachi Cocom offers à la carte Mexican cuisine. Don't expect gourmet, but perfectly satisfying beach fare.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Drinks:</strong> Margaritas are ubiquitous and range from excellent to terrible. Ask for "fresh lime" rather than sour mix. Mexican beer (Corona, Modelo, Pacifico) is refreshing in the heat. Tequila tastings at various downtown shops are fun if you don't mind the sales pitch. Prices range from $5-12 for cocktails at beach clubs, less in town.</p>

          <h2>Important Notices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Revolution Day (November 20):</strong> Mexico celebrates this national holiday with parades and festivities. Downtown streets may be closed, affecting routes between piers and attractions. Allow extra buffer time returning to ship if in port on this date.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Mexican Peso is official (around 17 pesos per USD), but US dollars accepted everywhere in tourist areas. You'll get better value paying in pesos. Many smaller vendors prefer cash; some apply 5% surcharge for credit cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Silver Jewelry:</strong> Always verify the .925 stamp indicating sterling silver. Reputable dealers show it gladly; if someone hesitates, walk away. Great prices available with negotiation.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Caribbean sun is intense — reef-safe sunscreen required for snorkeling to protect coral. Reapply frequently, especially after water activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Tender Days:</strong> During peak season, additional ships anchor offshore and tender passengers. This adds 20-30 minutes to your shore time and can be affected by weather.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- DEPTH SOUNDINGS -->
        <section class="port-section" id="depth-soundings">
          <h2>Depth Soundings: Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Cozumel earns its status as the Caribbean's most-visited cruise port. The combination of world-class snorkeling, excellent beach clubs, authentic Mayan history, and genuine Mexican culture creates an island that satisfies whether you want adrenaline or relaxation, culture or sunshine, adventure or a margarita by the pool.</p>

          <p>The water is why I keep coming back. That impossible clarity, the colors that look photoshopped but aren't, the feeling of floating through Jacques Cousteau's underwater cathedral alongside sea turtles and rays — it never gets old, no matter how many times I've done it. El Cielo's starfish sandbar remains one of my favorite cruise port moments ever.</p>

          <p>For first-timers, I'd suggest Paradise Beach for a relaxed introduction, or a snorkel excursion to Palancar Reef to understand why Cousteau was so captivated. For repeat visitors, San Gervasio offers depth, Punta Sur offers wilderness, and the taco stands of San Miguel offer the authentic Mexico that cruise ports rarely reveal. Cozumel has given me something new every single time.</p>

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <section class="port-section" id="faq">
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p><strong>Q: Which beach club should I choose?</strong><br/>A: Paradise Beach for families (water toys, activities, $50-70). Mr. Sanchos for all-inclusive party atmosphere ($65-85). Nachi Cocom for couples seeking quieter, limited-guest experience ($55-75). Playa Mia for kids who need waterpark features ($60-90). All excellent; choice depends on your vibe.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is the snorkeling really that good?</strong><br/>A: Yes, legitimately world-class. Jacques Cousteau declared these reefs the world's best diving in 1961. Visibility often exceeds 100 feet. You'll see sea turtles, eagle rays, nurse sharks, and incredible coral. Even beginners have mind-blowing experiences on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Should I pay in pesos or dollars?</strong><br/>A: US dollars accepted everywhere in tourist areas, but you'll typically get 5-10% better prices paying in Mexican pesos. ATMs throughout downtown provide local currency. Many smaller shops and market vendors prefer cash; some charge 5% surcharge for credit cards.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Cozumel safe for cruise passengers?</strong><br/>A: Very safe in tourist areas. Stick to well-marked zones, use common sense with valuables, and you'll have zero issues. The island's economy depends on cruise tourism, and locals are welcoming and helpful. Aggressive vendors are annoying but harmless — a friendly "no gracias" works.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Should I visit Tulum from Cozumel?</strong><br/>A: It's a long day (ferry + 1-hour drive each way, 8+ hours total) but worthwhile if you've never seen the clifftop ruins. Book a ship excursion for guaranteed return, or go independent with very early start. Costa Maya is actually closer for Mayan ruins — consider that if visiting both ports.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: How far is downtown from the cruise pier?</strong><br/>A: Depends on your ship. Punta Langosta pier is directly in downtown — walk right off into shopping and restaurants. International and Puerta Maya piers are 3 miles south; budget $8-10 taxi or 45 minutes walking along the scenic waterfront.</p>
