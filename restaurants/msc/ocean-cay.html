      <h3>Ocean Cay Review: Seafood With a View (and Some Caveats)</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Ocean Cay is MSC's onboard seafood-focused restaurant, named after the cruise line's private Bahamian island. Found on select ships, it offers a dedicated seafood menu as a specialty venue with a cover charge. The concept is sound — a dedicated seafood room with ocean views on an ocean-going vessel. The execution is a mixed bag.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The grilled Mediterranean sea bass is the strongest entrée — whole fish, simply prepared, with lemon and olive oil. When the kitchen gets this right, it's genuinely excellent. The seafood platter (lobster tail, shrimp, mussels, and calamari) is the showpiece order and looks impressive on the table, though the lobster tail can run slightly overcooked. The lobster bisque starter is rich and well-spiced — a reliable opener. The raw bar options (oysters, shrimp cocktail) are clean and fresh when available. Honest assessment: Ocean Cay is inconsistent. On a good night with fresh provisioning, the seafood sings. On a mediocre night — particularly later in a longer itinerary — the fish can taste flat and the mussels rubbery. The pasta dishes (seafood linguine) feel like filler. The wine list offers decent white and rosé options that pair well with the menu.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Service is attentive and the staff are clearly trained to present seafood with care. The whole-fish presentation is a nice touch of theater. Wine recommendations are appropriate for the menu. The pacing is leisurely, which suits a seafood dinner. No complaints about the service — it's the kitchen consistency that creates the variance.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Nautical-elegant with soft blues, natural textures, and ocean-themed accents. On ships where Ocean Cay has window seating, the views complement the menu beautifully. It's a calmer, more refined space than the Main Dining Room. The décor doesn't try too hard, which is refreshing. Couples and small groups fit best here.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> Ocean Cay has the bones of a very good seafood restaurant — the sea bass and lobster bisque are highlights, and the atmosphere is lovely. It doesn't score higher because of genuine night-to-night inconsistency and a menu that's only partially convincing beyond the core fish dishes. If you love seafood and your cruise includes early-itinerary port provisioning, it's worth a visit. Otherwise, Butcher's Cut may be the safer specialty-dining bet. <em>Tip:</em> ask your server what came in fresh — they'll tell you honestly, and ordering accordingly makes a big difference.</p>
