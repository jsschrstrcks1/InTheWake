      "markdown": "**Seven Seas Splendor launched in 2020 with explicit mission: perfect what [Seven Seas Explorer](/ships/regent/seven-seas-explorer.html) had pioneered.**\n\nExplorer set new standards in 2016. Splendor refined them. The process Regent calls 'perfecting perfection' iterated on every element—suite layouts, public spaces, dining venues, operational details.\n\nThe differences are subtle but compound. Traffic patterns flow more smoothly. Venue proportions feel more balanced. The refinements emerge from four years of Explorer operations informing Splendor's final design.\n\n[Seven Seas Grandeur](/ships/regent/seven-seas-grandeur.html) continued the evolution in 2023. The Explorer Class represents continuous improvement rather than static design.\n\nFor fleet context: Splendor occupies middle position in Explorer Class evolution—newer than Explorer, more proven than Grandeur. Some guests prefer this balance of freshness and operational maturity.",

      "markdown": "**The Compass Rose serves as Seven Seas Splendor's main restaurant—and challenges assumptions about main dining room limitations.**\n\nOpen seating. No reservations. No upcharges. The freedom sounds like standard cruise dining. The execution achieves restaurant quality that specialty venues struggle to match.\n\nThe menu changes nightly with genuine culinary ambition. The kitchen uses premium ingredients—USDA Prime beef, fresh seafood, seasonal produce. The preparations reflect technique rather than volume cooking.\n\nService matches food quality. Waiters know regulars by name. Preferences noted early inform later service. The attention feels personal rather than programmatic.\n\nSpecialty restaurants—Chartreuse, Prime 7, Pacific Rim—offer variety without suggesting Compass Rose is inferior alternative. The main restaurant competes with rather than complements specialty venues.\n\nFor culinary priorities: Seven Seas Splendor's Compass Rose represents what main dining can achieve when lines invest seriously.",

      "markdown": "**Seven Seas Splendor debuted in February 2020—weeks before pandemic shutdown. The timing seemed catastrophic. The outcome proved otherwise.**\n\nThe pause allowed refinement. When Splendor finally sailed full schedules, she carried lessons from extended crew training and operational preparation. The delay may have enhanced rather than diminished debut experience.\n\nBy now, Splendor has proven herself across multiple seasons. Initial concerns about pandemic-delayed ship have dissolved. She operates as mature vessel with established crew culture.\n\nCompared to newer Grandeur, Splendor offers slightly more operational history. Compared to older Explorer, she reflects more recent design iteration. The middle position serves guests who value proven performance without wanting oldest ship.\n\nFor Explorer Class assessment: Splendor represents the class at proven maturity. The pandemic timing created uncertainty that operational excellence resolved.",
