# Session Start Guardrail Hook — v1.0.0
#
# CRITICAL: This hook runs on EVERY UserPromptSubmit and injects the
# careful-not-clever guardrail into Claude's context.
#
# This hook exists because Claude kept "forgetting" the rules that had been
# established for weeks. The TypeScript skill-activation-prompt.ts was missing
# entirely, causing silent failures.
#
# This hook is SIMPLE by design:
# - Pure bash, no dependencies
# - Reads the CAREFUL.md file directly
# - Outputs to stdout (which Claude sees as context)
# - Cannot fail silently - if the file is missing, it errors loudly
#
# Soli Deo Gloria
# ============================================================================
