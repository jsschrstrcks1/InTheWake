                        <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> RipCord by iFLY is a complimentary indoor skydiving simulator exclusive to Quantum Class ships. You'll experience the sensation of freefall flight in a vertical wind tunnel with speeds up to 120 mph. Sessions include training, flight suit, and instructor guidance. Book via the Royal Caribbean app immediately on embarkation day—slots fill within minutes.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>RipCord by iFLY brings the exhilaration of skydiving to the high seas. Developed in partnership with iFLY, the world's leading indoor skydiving company, this vertical wind tunnel generates air speeds up to 120 mph, creating enough lift to suspend you in mid-air—simulating the freefall sensation of jumping from an airplane.</p>

                        <p>Located on the upper deck of Quantum Class ships, RipCord offers something no land-based facility can match: flying with panoramic ocean views. The transparent flight chamber lets spectators watch while flyers experience the unique thrill of floating above the waves.</p>

                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>The vertical wind tunnel uses powerful fans beneath the flight chamber to generate a column of air strong enough to support human flight. Professional instructors guide you through every moment—from your first hover to controlled movements. Most guests are flying confidently within seconds.</p>

                        <h3>What's Included</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pre-flight training session (approximately 30 minutes)</li>
                            <li>Flight suit, helmet, goggles, and earplugs</li>
                            <li>Two flights (approximately 1 minute of total flight time)</li>
                            <li>Hands-on instructor guidance throughout</li>
