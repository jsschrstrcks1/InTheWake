      "markdown": "**Eight courses. Live jazz trio. A storyline that unfolds between plates. This isn't just dinner \u2014 it's theater.**\n\nLincoln Park Supper Club is Star's signature specialty restaurant, unique to this ship. It's inspired by 1930s Chicago's legendary dining clubs \u2014 the Chez Paree, the Pump Room \u2014 where dinner was entertainment and entertainment was art.\n\nMy wife was skeptical. \"It's a gimmick,\" she said when I showed her the menu. Eight courses at $175 per person seemed excessive. But I'd read about the live performers, the themed courses, the way they integrated story into every dish. I convinced her to try it.\n\nWe arrived to dim lighting, art deco design, velvet curtains, and a jazz trio already playing. Our server greeted us in character \u2014 a 1930s maitre d' welcoming us to the club. The menu was presented as a \"program\" for the evening's performance.\n\nEach course had a story. The amuse-bouche was inspired by prohibition-era speakeasies. The seafood course referenced Lake Michigan. The wagyu beef paid homage to Chicago stockyards. Between courses, performers appeared \u2014 a torch singer, a tap dancer, a magician who did close-up tricks at our table.\n\nThe food was exceptional. Not just \"cruise ship specialty dining good\" \u2014 actually exceptional. The kind of plating and flavors you'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. But the entertainment elevated it beyond just a meal.\n\nBy course six, my wife leaned over: \"Okay, this was worth it.\"\n\nHere's what makes Lincoln Park different from [150 Central Park](/restaurants/150-central-park.html) or [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html): it's immersive. You're not just eating; you're experiencing. The performers aren't background noise \u2014 they're part of the meal. The story isn't decoration \u2014 it's the framework.\n\nIs it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it for a special occasion? Absolutely. Book it for an anniversary, milestone birthday, or that one night you want to remember.\n\n**Note:** Lincoln Park is only on Star of the Seas. Icon has Empire Supper Club instead (different theme, similar concept). Both are Icon Class exclusives.\n\nSee our [specialty dining guide](/restaurants.html) for more options.",

      "markdown": "**\"Which one should we book?\" The most common question I get about Icon Class ships.**\n\nI've sailed both [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) and Star of the Seas. Same class. Nearly identical deck plans. Same neighborhoods (Thrill Island, AquaDome, Surfside, Central Park, The Hideaway). Same waterpark. Same pools. Same Royal Promenade layout.\n\nSo what's actually different?\n\n**The signature restaurant:** Icon has Empire Supper Club. Star has Lincoln Park Supper Club. Both are themed dinner-theater experiences, but Empire leans modern Vegas, Lincoln Park leans 1930s Chicago. Pick the theme that appeals to you.\n\n**Launch timing:** Icon debuted January 2024. Star debuted August 2025. Star has minor refinements based on Icon's first year \u2014 slightly adjusted signage, a few operational improvements, but nothing dramatic.\n\n**Itineraries:** Both sail 7-night Eastern and Western Caribbean from Port Canaveral year-round, but check specific dates and ports. Sometimes one has the itinerary you want when the other doesn't.\n\n**Pricing:** Star was slightly cheaper at launch (newer ships often have introductory pricing), but prices fluctuate. Compare both for your dates.\n\n**That's... it.** Seriously. Same Category 6 waterpark. Same Crown's Edge thrill ride. Same AquaDome shows. Same [Surfside](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html) family neighborhood. Same suite perks. Same everything.\n\nIf someone tells you one is dramatically better than the other, they're selling something. These are sister ships in the truest sense \u2014 same parent, same DNA, tiny cosmetic differences.\n\n**My advice:**\n1. Compare prices for your dates\n2. Check itineraries (which ports do you want?)\n3. Look at dining options (Empire vs. Lincoln Park theme preference)\n4. Book whichever is available/affordable\n\nYou can't go wrong with either. They're both incredible ships. The biggest mistake would be agonizing over which one instead of just booking the cruise.\n\nFor Icon Class details, see [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) or our [ship comparison guide](/ships.html).",

Biggest ship in the world! Eight neighborhoods! Something for everyone! How could we possibly run out of space or activities?\n\nTurns out, logistics on a ship with 7,600 guests require military-level coordination.\n\nDay one, we tried to meet for breakfast. Half the family went to [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html) (buffet). The other half went to [AquaDome Market](/restaurants/aquadome-market.html) (food hall). My brother-in-law took his kids to [Surfside Eatery](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html) (family dining). We gave up and ate separately.\n\nThe pool deck was packed. Not \"busy\" \u2014 *packed*. We couldn't find fourteen lounge chairs together. Ever. The kids wanted the waterslides, but the lines were 45 minutes. The adults wanted quiet, but every pool area had music, activities, or hundreds of kids.\n\nReservations for shows and specialty dining required booking months in advance or racing to the app the moment they opened. We managed to get everyone into one [Lincoln Park Supper Club](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html) reservation by sheer luck and aggressive refreshing.\n\n**Here's what we learned:**\n\n1. **Use group messaging religiously.** WhatsApp, the Royal Caribbean app, something. Texting doesn't work at sea without expensive plans.\n\n2. **Plan one coordinated activity per day max.** Dinner together. That's it. Everything else, split up and report back.\n\n3. **Book everything early.** Shows, restaurants, excursions. The ship holds 7,600 people. Popular things sell out.\n\n4. **Embrace separation.** The teenagers wanted Thrill Island waterslides. The toddlers needed Surfside. The adults wanted The Hideaway adults-only area. That's fine. Meet for dinner.\n\n5. **Lower expectations.** You won't do everything together. You won't hit every venue. That's okay.\n\nBy day four, we stopped trying to coordinate everything and just... cruised. The kids did their thing. The adults did ours. We'd meet for dinner, share stories, laugh about the chaos. It was better that way.\n\nStar is an incredible ship. But it's still a ship. Physics exists. You can't have 14 people in 7 different cabins experiencing everything together without frustration.\n\nGo smaller if togetherness matters most. Or go Star and embrace beautiful, chaotic independence.\n\nSee our [group cruise planning](/planning.html) guide for more realistic expectations.",
