      <h3>The Casino Review: Better Design, Same House Edge</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Casino on Virgin Voyages features 115 slot machines arranged across themed districts (Little Asia, Ocean Drive, Adventure Alley) plus table games including blackjack, craps, roulette, and poker variants. It is more design-forward than most cruise ship casinos — think moody lighting, themed zones, and a contemporary aesthetic rather than the garish carpet-and-neon standard. Unlike many cruise lines, Virgin does not offer complimentary drinks while gambling. The Casino Bar is adjacent; Bar Tab or per-drink pricing applies. Open when the ship is in international waters.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The Casino Bar serves the standard cocktail menu, and floor servers circulate through the gaming floor taking orders from active players. The whiskey and cola and the old fashioned are the most common table-game orders. Draft beer is quick and reliable. Where it falls short: unlike land-based casinos (and some competing cruise lines), there are no complimentary drinks for active players. Every drink costs money or Bar Tab credit, which stings when you are already feeding the house. The floor server coverage is inconsistent — sometimes drinks arrive promptly, sometimes you wait 20 minutes. The lack of complimentary drinks is the most common complaint from experienced casino guests.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The table game dealers are professional and friendly — they deal efficiently, explain rules to newcomers, and maintain a sociable atmosphere at the tables. The blackjack tables are the most popular and the dealers are skilled at keeping the game moving. Poker tournaments (when offered) are well-organized. The slot attendants are helpful and responsive. Where it falls short: table minimums can be high on busy evenings ($25-50 for blackjack), which prices out casual players. The poker room is small and offerings are limited compared to land casinos. Craps tables have specific schedules rather than being always open.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The themed district design is genuinely clever — each zone has its own aesthetic, which makes the casino feel larger and more varied than a single open room. The Little Asia section features Asian-themed slots and a distinct visual identity. Ocean Drive channels Miami neon. The overall design is a significant step above the average cruise casino. The energy is lively on sea-day evenings and after shows. Where it falls short: it is still a cruise ship casino. The slot selection, while visually appealing, is standard fare. The table game variety is limited compared to what you would find in Las Vegas or even a mid-size land casino. The ventilation, while better than older ships, still carries a faintly stale quality during peak hours. Non-gamblers will find little reason to visit.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.6/5.</strong> The Casino is the best-designed gaming space on any cruise ship — the themed districts are creative, the table game dealers are professional, and the overall aesthetic is a genuine improvement over the industry standard. It falls short on the no-complimentary-drinks policy (a dealbreaker for some), high table minimums, and limited game variety. <em>Tip:</em> play on the first night when table minimums are typically lower and the floor is less crowded. The blackjack tables near the Casino Bar entrance tend to have the most sociable dealers.</p>
