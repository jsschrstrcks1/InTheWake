        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship into tropical heat that wrapped around me like a warm blanket, carrying the scent of frangipani and something savory drifting from a nearby food stall—accras, I would learn, crispy salt cod fritters that are the unofficial national snack. The port at Pointe-à-Pitre was bustling with taxi drivers calling out destinations and market vendors arranging pyramids of tropical fruit. This is France, technically—the tricolor flag flies overhead and the euro is the currency—but everything else whispers Caribbean, from the weathered colonial buildings to the reggae drifting from a distant speaker to the unhurried pace that makes rushing feel almost rude.</p>

            <p>Guadeloupe is shaped like a butterfly, two wings connected by a narrow bridge over a mangrove-lined channel. Basse-Terre to the west is mountainous and wild, dominated by the active volcano La Soufrière, its peak often wrapped in clouds. Grande-Terre to the east is flatter and more developed, home to the famous shores of Sainte-Anne and the dramatic cliffs of Pointe des Châteaux. I wanted to see both wings, to understand how one small archipelago could contain such variety, and so I hired a taxi driver named Marcel who became my guide for the day.</p>

            <p>We drove first to La Soufrière, climbing roads that wound through banana plantations and rainforest dense with giant ferns and mahogany trees. The air cooled as we ascended, and mist began to swirl through the vegetation like something from a dream. However, it was at the trailhead that the landscape truly transformed—rocky volcanic terrain stretching upward into clouds, sulfurous vents steaming from fissures in the earth. I hiked for an hour along paths worn smooth by countless pilgrims to this sacred peak, passing pools of mineral water that glowed an unearthly green. Tears pricked my eyes when I finally stood at a viewpoint looking down through clouds to the Caribbean stretching to the horizon. The power and beauty of this living volcano humbled me completely.</p>

            <p>Lunch came at a roadside restaurant in the hills—authentic Créole cuisine that tasted like nothing I'd encountered before. Colombo de poulet, chicken simmered in a curry-like spice blend brought by Indian laborers in the nineteenth century. Rice and red beans cooked with coconut. Plantains fried to caramelized perfection. Ti' punch to drink—white rum, lime, and cane sugar, the holy trinity of French Caribbean refreshment. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected feast, this glimpse into a culture that blended French elegance with Caribbean soul and African heritage into something uniquely beautiful.</p>

            <p>The afternoon took us to Sainte-Anne on Grande-Terre, where palm trees leaned over sand the color of powdered sugar and the water shifted through impossible shades of turquoise. Marcel dropped me at a quiet stretch away from the crowds, and I swam in water so warm and clear it felt like bathing in liquid silk. Fish darted around my ankles as I stood in the shallows, watching pelicans dive for their own lunch offshore. Yet even this paradise held complexity—Marcel told me about the island's history of slavery and resistance, about the Créole culture that emerged from that painful past, about his grandmother who still spoke the old language and remembered the old ways.</p>

            <p>As the sun began its descent toward the western horizon, we drove to Pointe des Châteaux, the easternmost point of Grande-Terre. Here the Atlantic crashes against cliffs carved into fantastic shapes by millennia of waves, a dramatic counterpoint to the gentle Caribbean waters on the other side of the island. I climbed to the cross at the viewpoint and watched the light turn golden over the sea, thinking about all the sailors and explorers and enslaved people who had passed through these waters, each leaving their mark on this butterfly-shaped island that somehow held all of Caribbean history in its wings.</p>

            <p>I felt blessed and privileged to have discovered Guadeloupe—not the sanitized tourist version but the real island, with its volcanic heart and colonial scars and extraordinary generosity. Marcel refused to accept payment beyond the agreed fare, insisting instead that I return someday to see Marie-Galante, the sugar island visible from Pointe des Châteaux. "There is always more to see," he said with a smile. I climbed back aboard the ship as darkness fell, carrying the taste of ti' punch and the smell of sulfur and the sound of Créole French in my ears, grateful beyond measure for this day.</p>

            <p>This is what Guadeloupe taught me: that complexity makes places richer, not poorer. This butterfly island holds volcanic fire and calm turquoise waters, French sophistication and Caribbean soul, painful history and vibrant present—all woven together into something more beautiful than any single thread could be. I learned that the best travel happens when you let a local guide show you their home through their eyes, when you eat what they eat and go where they go. I learned that paradise always has depth beneath its surface, and that understanding that depth makes the beauty more meaningful, not less.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at the Port Autonome de la Guadeloupe in Pointe-à-Pitre, the commercial capital of Grande-Terre. The terminal area offers basic facilities including tourist information, taxi stands, and vendors. Downtown Pointe-à-Pitre is walkable from the port—about 10 minutes to the main market and colonial quarter. However, Guadeloupe's best attractions require transportation.</p>

            <p>Pointe-à-Pitre itself is an authentic French Caribbean city with colorful colonial architecture, bustling markets, and genuine local atmosphere. The Marché de la Darse offers spices, tropical fruits, and handicrafts. Memorial ACTe is a powerful museum dedicated to the history of slavery. However, most cruise visitors head to the island's natural attractions—volcanic mountains, tropical shores, or rainforest waterfalls.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to high depending on activities.</strong> Walking Pointe-à-Pitre is manageable for most visitors, though streets can be uneven. Reaching Sainte-Anne shores (45 minutes) or La Soufrière volcano (1 hour+) requires taxi or tour. Volcano hiking is strenuous—steep terrain, potentially muddy trails, and high altitude. Shores and snorkeling are low-effort relaxation. Wheelchair users will find the port area accessible but most attractions challenging. Budget 6-8 hours for a satisfying exploration.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> The primary option for cruise visitors. Taxis wait at the port with set rates to popular destinations. Expect €40-60 to Sainte-Anne shores (45 minutes), €50-70 to La Soufrière trailhead (1 hour+), €30-40 to Pointe des Châteaux. Negotiate full-day rates (€150-200) if you want to see multiple sites. Drivers often speak limited English—French phrases help.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer island tours, volcano visits, and shore packages ($90-180). Going <strong>independent</strong> by taxi is feasible but requires initiative and basic French. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular excursions as they fill quickly. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, ship tours eliminate timing anxiety.</p>

            <p><strong>Car rental:</strong> Available in Pointe-à-Pitre for confident drivers. Roads are generally good but mountain routes can be challenging. Driving is on the right (French style). Allows flexibility but requires navigation skills and time.</p>

            <p><strong>Public buses:</strong> Exist but are limited for tourists—irregular schedules, crowded, and primarily serving locals. Not recommended for cruise day trips.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Pointe-à-Pitre is walkable from the port (10-15 minutes). Markets, colonial architecture, and Memorial ACTe are accessible on foot. Beyond the city, walking isn't practical—distances are too great.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The port area is reasonably accessible with paved surfaces. Downtown Pointe-à-Pitre has uneven sidewalks and some stairs. Shores vary—some have facilities, others are natural with no infrastructure. Volcanic trails are not wheelchair accessible. Consider ship excursions that specify accessibility options.</p>

            <h3>La Soufrière Volcano</h3>
            <p>The active volcano that dominates Basse-Terre rises to 1,467 meters (4,813 feet)—the highest peak in the Lesser Antilles. The hike from the trailhead at Bains Jaunes takes 2-3 hours round trip through volcanic terrain with sulfur vents, steaming fumaroles, and stunning views. Moderate to strenuous depending on conditions—expect mud, steep sections, and potentially clouds at the summit. Wear hiking shoes, bring water and layers (cooler at altitude). Free access. Taxi to trailhead €50-70 (1 hour). Ship excursions ($100-150) include transport and guides. Essential experience for nature lovers.</p>

            <h3>Sainte-Anne Shores</h3>
            <p>The most famous waterfront area in Guadeloupe—palm-fringed white sand, turquoise water, and gentle waves. Multiple options: municipal area (free, basic facilities) or Club Med area (open to public, €15-20 for chair/umbrella). Water sports, snorkeling, and restaurants available. Taxi from port €40-60 (45 minutes). Allow half-day for relaxed experience. Ship excursions ($80-120) often include transport and lunch.</p>

            <h3>Pointe des Châteaux</h3>
            <p>Dramatic cliffs at Grande-Terre's eastern tip where the Atlantic crashes against rocks carved into cathedral-like formations. Short hike (15-20 minutes) to the cross at the summit offers panoramic views of nearby islands. Free access. Taxi from port €30-40 (30 minutes). Often combined with Sainte-Anne in a day tour. Best in clear weather for views. Spectacular sunset location if timing allows.</p>

            <h3>Carbet Falls</h3>
            <p>Three spectacular waterfalls in Basse-Terre's rainforest. The most accessible (Deuxième Chute) requires a moderate 20-minute hike through jungle terrain. Swimming possible at some falls. Expect mud and humidity. Entry €2-3. Taxi to trailhead €50-60. Often combined with volcano or rainforest tours. Ship excursions ($90-130) include guides and transportation.</p>

            <h3>Memorial ACTe</h3>
            <p>Powerful museum in Pointe-à-Pitre dedicated to the history of slavery and the slave trade in the Caribbean. Modern architecture, moving exhibits, and important historical context for understanding the region. Entry €15. Walkable from port (15 minutes). Allow 2 hours minimum. French and English exhibitions. Essential for understanding Guadeloupe's complex history and culture.</p>

            <h3>Pointe-à-Pitre Walking Tour</h3>
            <p>Explore the authentic French Caribbean city on foot. Visit Marché de la Darse (spices, fruits, crafts), Marché Saint-Antoine (local food), Place de la Victoire (colonial square), and colonial-era architecture. Free to wander. Budget €20-40 for market purchases and refreshments. Ti' punch at a local bar is essential. Allow 2-3 hours. Combines well with Memorial ACTe for a cultural morning.</p>
