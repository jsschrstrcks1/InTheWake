      <h2>Captain's Logbook</h2>

      <p>The ship pulled into Resurrection Bay on a crystalline August morning, snow-capped mountains rising directly from the water on all sides and bald eagles circling lazily overhead. I stood on deck with my coffee watching the approach, and the air smelled of salt water, glacier silt, and the promise of wildlife. Seward is small — maybe 3,000 permanent residents — but it punches far above its weight as a cruise destination. This is the gateway to Kenai Fjords National Park, and I'd been told that the day cruise into the fjords was the single best wildlife experience in Alaska. I was skeptical of that claim. I shouldn't have been.</p>

      <p>We had booked the full 8-hour Kenai Fjords cruise with Major Marine Tours ($225 per person), and by 8:30 AM we were motoring out of Resurrection Bay into the Gulf of Alaska. The captain hadn't even finished his safety briefing when someone yelled "Orcas!" A pod of six transient killer whales was hunting Dall's porpoise about 200 yards off our port side. I watched through binoculars as they worked together, the distinctive black dorsal fins cutting through gray water, then erupting in a coordinated attack. The porpoise didn't make it. I understood then why they're called killer whales — it was raw, brutal, magnificent nature happening right beside our boat.</p>

      <p>We continued past Chiswell Islands, where Steller sea lions by the hundreds hauled out on rocky ledges, barking and jostling and occasionally launching themselves into the water to fish. Horned puffins nested in the cliff faces, their orange beaks unmistakable even from the boat. I counted at least eight bald eagles on one small islet. The naturalist on board pointed out tufted puffins, common murres, cormorants, and pigeon guillemots — the place was thick with seabirds in a way I'd never experienced before.</p>

      <p>Then came the humpbacks. We encountered three separate groups — including a mother and calf — and spent nearly an hour watching them lunge-feed on herring, their massive mouths breaking the surface, baleen filtering tons of water. One whale surfaced so close I could smell its breath (fishy, in case you wondered). The captain cut engines and we drifted in silence except for the blow of whales surfacing around us. However, the highlight was still to come.</p>

      <p>Aialik Glacier is a tidewater glacier — meaning it flows directly into the ocean — and it's actively calving. The captain nosed our boat within a quarter mile of the glacier face, a wall of blue and white ice 300 feet tall stretching across the fjord. We sat there for twenty minutes listening to the groans and cracks of ice under pressure, watching house-sized chunks break free and explode into the water. The crew chipped ice off a small berg for "glacier margaritas" — tequila poured over 10,000-year-old ice. We toasted to Kenai Fjords while the glacier continued its ancient work of grinding mountains into the sea.</p>

      <p>Back in Seward by late afternoon, I walked to the Alaska SeaLife Center ($27 admission) — Alaska's only public aquarium and marine wildlife rescue facility. I touched sea stars in the tide pool exhibit, watched puffins dive in the aviary, and observed a rescued Steller sea lion doing flips for fish. The center rescues and rehabilitates injured marine mammals; some can be released while others become permanent residents and ambassadors for their species. It's genuinely educational rather than just entertaining.</p>

      <p>Dinner was halibut cheeks at Ray's Waterfront ($32) — buttery, sweet, better than lobster — while watching fishing boats return to harbor. I walked the waterfront afterward, reading about how the 1964 Good Friday earthquake nearly destroyed Seward. The 9.2 magnitude quake triggered massive waves and fires that flattened the waterfront, killed 13 people, and collapsed the economy. Although the devastation was nearly total, the town rebuilt itself as the gateway to Kenai Fjords National Park. That resilience is part of what gives Seward its character today.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Drifting in silence before Aialik Glacier, listening to ancient ice groan and crack, watching a house-sized chunk calve into the sea — and understanding in my bones that this is what Alaska is really about: wild places where nature operates on its own schedule, indifferent to human plans.
      </div>

      <p>The pros: world-class wildlife viewing — legitimately the best single-day wildlife experience I've had anywhere. Charming small-town atmosphere, excellent Alaska SeaLife Center, the famous Alaska Railroad connection to Anchorage. Kenai Fjords delivers on every promise.</p>

      <p>The cons: weather can cancel or significantly impact fjord cruises — the Gulf of Alaska is rough, and seas too high mean a shorter trip or no trip at all. Take seasickness medication even if you don't think you need it. The 8-hour cruise is a long day, especially combined with a transfer to Anchorage afterward.</p>

      <p>The bottom line: if your Alaska cruise stops in Seward and you only do one excursion the entire trip, make it the Kenai Fjords cruise. Nothing else comes close. Book ahead through your cruise line for guaranteed return to ship, or book independent if you're willing to accept the (small) risk of a delay.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cruise_port" class="card">
      <h2>Cruise Port</h2>
      <p>Seward functions primarily as a turnaround port rather than a port of call — most cruises either begin or end here, with passengers transferring to Anchorage via train or bus. However, some itineraries do stop in Seward as a port of call, giving passengers a full day to explore.</p>
      <p>The Seward Cruise Ship Terminal is located at the south end of town, about 1 mile from the historic downtown area and Small Boat Harbor where the Kenai Fjords tour boats depart. The terminal sits adjacent to the Alaska Railroad depot, making the train connection seamless for turnaround passengers. The facility includes restrooms, a small visitor center with maps and information, and covered waiting areas.</p>
      <p>Free shuttle buses (yellow school buses) run continuously between the cruise terminal and downtown during the cruise season, typically from 8 AM to 6 PM. The shuttle stops at the Small Boat Harbor, downtown shops and restaurants, and the Alaska SeaLife Center. The walk is flat and scenic if you prefer — about 20-25 minutes at a leisurely pace along the waterfront. Wheelchair users will find the route accessible with paved sidewalks and curb cuts throughout downtown.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="getting_around" class="card">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Seward is compact and walkable, with most attractions accessible on foot from the cruise terminal or downtown. The town stretches about 2 miles along Resurrection Bay, with mountains rising directly behind.</p>

      <h4>On Foot</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Terminal to Downtown:</strong> About 1 mile on flat, paved sidewalks along the waterfront. Pleasant 20-minute walk with mountain and harbor views.</li>
        <li><strong>Downtown Area:</strong> Compact and fully walkable. Restaurants, shops, and the Alaska SeaLife Center are clustered within a few blocks of the Small Boat Harbor.</li>
        <li><strong>Waterfront Trail:</strong> Paved walking path runs along the harbor — excellent for a stroll between attractions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Free Shuttle</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Port Shuttle:</strong> Free yellow school buses run between the cruise terminal, Small Boat Harbor, downtown, and Alaska SeaLife Center on cruise days (8 AM – 6 PM).</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Shuttles run approximately every 15-20 minutes during peak hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Buses are wheelchair accessible with lifts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Train & Bus to Anchorage</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alaska Railroad:</strong> Scenic 4-hour journey to Anchorage ($120-250 depending on class). Departs from terminal adjacent to cruise dock. Spectacular views of mountains, glaciers, and wildlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Park Connection Bus:</strong> Twice-daily service to Anchorage (3 hours, $65-85). More frequent departures than train.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take the train one direction for scenery, bus the other for speed. Many cruise packages include rail transport.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Taxis & Car Rental</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Limited availability — book in advance if needed. About $15-20 from terminal to downtown.</li>
        <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Budget and local agencies available. Useful for Exit Glacier ($100-130/day).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Accessibility Note:</strong> Downtown Seward is wheelchair accessible with paved sidewalks and curb cuts. The waterfront path is flat and accessible. The Alaska SeaLife Center is fully accessible. Some tour boats have limited accessibility — contact operators in advance.</p>

    <section id="excursions" class="card">
      <h2>Top Excursions</h2>
      <p>Seward excursions center on Kenai Fjords National Park — one of Alaska's premier wilderness areas. The park is accessible only by boat or floatplane, making day cruises the primary way to experience it. Book ahead through your cruise line for guaranteed return to ship or with local operators for potentially lower prices.</p>

      <h3>Kenai Fjords Wildlife & Glacier Cruise</h3>
      <p>The signature Seward experience ($175-275, 6-8 hours). Full-day cruises with Major Marine Tours or Kenai Fjords Tours take you deep into Resurrection Bay and the Gulf of Alaska to see tidewater glaciers, whales, puffins, sea lions, and harbor seals. Ship excursion prices run 15-20% higher than booking independent, but include guaranteed return to ship. The shorter 4-hour cruises ($125-175) see less wildlife and don't reach the glaciers — the full day is worth every extra hour. This is the best single-day wildlife experience in Alaska.</p>

      <h3>Exit Glacier Hike</h3>
      <p>Visit Alaska's most accessible glacier ($60-120, 3-4 hours) at Kenai Fjords National Park's only road-accessible area. Guided tours include transportation and ranger-led hikes to the glacier toe. The Harding Icefield Trail (8.2 miles round trip, strenuous) offers views of the massive icefield. For independent travelers, a rental car or taxi ($50-70 one way) reaches the trailhead; entrance is free with America the Beautiful pass or $20/vehicle.</p>

      <h3>Alaska SeaLife Center</h3>
      <p>Alaska's only public aquarium and marine wildlife rescue facility ($27 adults, 2-3 hours). Located downtown within walking distance of the cruise terminal. Touch sea stars, watch puffins dive, observe rescued seals and sea lions. Excellent for families or wildlife enthusiasts. Behind-the-scenes tours ($50-75) available with advance booking.</p>

      <h3>Salmon & Halibut Fishing</h3>
      <p>Charter fishing trips ($250-400 per person, 4-8 hours) target king salmon, silver salmon, and halibut in Resurrection Bay. Full-day trips venture further for larger fish. Fish processing and shipping available. Book well ahead — popular charters sell out months in advance.</p>

      <h3>Kayaking Resurrection Bay</h3>
      <p>Guided kayak tours ($85-175, 3-6 hours) explore the calm waters of the bay with chances to see otters, seals, and seabirds up close. No experience necessary for beginner trips. Multi-day expeditions into Kenai Fjords available for experienced paddlers.</p>

      <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
      <p>The Kenai Fjords cruises are extremely popular — book ahead when your cruise opens reservations. Ship excursion prices include guaranteed return to ship, which matters on an embarkation/disembarkation day. For independent booking, Major Marine Tours and Kenai Fjords Tours offer similar experiences at competitive prices ($175-225 for the full day). Weather cancellations happen — the Gulf of Alaska is unpredictable. If your cruise only calls at Seward, the fjord cruise is the one must-do experience.</p>

      <h2>Depth Soundings</h2>
      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Everything you need to know before stepping ashore.</p>

      <h3>Weather & What to Bring</h3>
      <p>Seward weather is maritime — cool, often cloudy, with rain possible any day. Summer temperatures average 50-65°F (10-18°C). The fjord cruises encounter colder temperatures, wind, and spray. Dress warmer than you think you need.</p>

      <h4>Essential Gear</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm layers:</strong> The boat deck is cold. Bring fleece, jacket, and windbreaker even on sunny days.</li>
        <li><strong>Rain gear:</strong> Waterproof outer layer essential. Spray from the boat and glacier calving will get you wet.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfortable shoes:</strong> Non-slip soles for boat decks; waterproof for Exit Glacier trails.</li>
        <li><strong>Binoculars:</strong> Essential for wildlife spotting — whales, eagles, puffins at distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera with zoom:</strong> Wildlife is often at distance; 200mm+ lens helps capture the action.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasickness medication:</strong> Take Bonine or Dramamine before boarding. The Gulf of Alaska can be rough.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Useful Details</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> US Dollars. ATMs available downtown and at the Alaska SeaLife Center.</li>
        <li><strong>WiFi/Cell:</strong> Cell service good in town; spotty to none in Kenai Fjords. WiFi at cafes and library.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Downtown is wheelchair accessible. Some tour boats have limited accessibility — contact operators in advance. Alaska SeaLife Center is fully accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Anchorage is 125 miles north (2.5-3 hours by car, 4 hours by train).</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Dial 911. Providence Seward Medical Center provides emergency services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Costs & Tipping</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meals:</strong> Halibut and chips $18-24, fish tacos $14-18, halibut cheeks $28-35, local beer $7-9.</li>
        <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> 15-20% at restaurants, $10-20 per person for half-day tours, $20-30 for full-day cruises.</li>
        <li><strong>Attractions:</strong> Alaska SeaLife Center $27 adults, Exit Glacier $20/vehicle.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Train to Anchorage $120-250, bus $65-85, taxi around town $15-20.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ray's Waterfront serves some of the best halibut in Alaska — the halibut cheeks are legendary. For a more casual meal, Resurrect Art Coffee House has excellent sandwiches and the best coffee in town.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is the Kenai Fjords cruise worth the price?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely — it's the single best wildlife experience in Alaska. The full 6-8 hour cruise ($175-275) includes orcas, humpback whales, puffins, sea lions, harbor seals, and calving tidewater glaciers. The shorter 4-hour cruises don't reach the glaciers and see significantly less wildlife. If you can only do one excursion on your entire Alaska trip, this is the one.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Should I book the cruise through my ship or independently?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">For embarkation or disembarkation days, book through your cruise line — this guarantees the ship won't leave without you if the tour runs late. For port calls where you're returning to the same ship, independent booking with Major Marine or Kenai Fjords Tours offers similar quality at slightly lower prices ($175-225 vs $200-275).</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How do I get from Seward to Anchorage?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The Alaska Railroad scenic train takes about 4 hours and offers spectacular mountain, glacier, and wildlife views ($120-250 depending on class). By bus (Park Connection), it's about 3 hours and $65-85. Many people take the train one direction for the scenery and bus the other for speed. Rental cars are also available for the 125-mile drive through stunning Kenai Peninsula scenery.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What should I do if I get seasick?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Take Bonine or Dramamine at least 30 minutes before boarding — don't wait until you feel sick. The Gulf of Alaska can be rough even on good days. Stay on deck where you can see the horizon, stay hydrated, and avoid greasy food before the cruise. Some people find acupressure wristbands helpful. The crew has additional remedies if needed.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is there enough to do in Seward without the fjord cruise?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — the Alaska SeaLife Center is excellent for 2-3 hours, downtown is charming for shopping and dining, and Exit Glacier offers hiking opportunities. The waterfront walk is scenic and relaxing. However, the Kenai Fjords cruise is genuinely the highlight of Seward, and skipping it means missing the main reason to visit this port.</p>

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Seward is the gateway to Kenai Fjords National Park — offering what many call the best single-day wildlife experience in Alaska. Orcas, humpback whales, puffins, sea lions, and calving tidewater glaciers all in one unforgettable cruise.
