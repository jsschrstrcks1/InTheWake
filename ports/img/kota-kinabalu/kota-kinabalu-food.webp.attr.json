  "description": "We headed to Sutera Harbour Golf and Country Club today for lunch. I felt like having bread with some meat, so I ordered a burger. One costs RM 40 (RM 20 for members). There was a choice between chicken and beef; I decided to go for beef.\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the portion and the presentation of the burger. The top sesame seed bun came with a sunny side up fried egg. And below it was a big lump of yummy beef meat and a piece of bacon, which I presume to be beef bacon. At the bottom is a piece of cabbage.\n</p>\nTo top it off, there was some pink cabbage coleslaw and fries, which made me full after eating all. I give this a 80% and is a must try for all burger lovers!",
