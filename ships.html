    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section class="card prose" aria-labelledby="faq-heading">
      <h2 id="faq-heading">Common Questions About Royal Caribbean Ships</h2>

      <h3>How do I choose the right Royal Caribbean ship for my cruise?</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing the right ship depends on your travel style and priorities. <strong>Icon and Oasis-class ships</strong>
        (Icon of the Seas, Wonder of the Seas, Symphony of the Seas) offer the most amenities and activities—ideal
        for families and first-time cruisers who want everything under one hull.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Quantum-class ships</strong> (Odyssey, Anthem, Quantum of the Seas) bring innovation front and center
        with features like the North Star observation pod, iFly skydiving simulators, and Two70° entertainment venues.
        These ships balance size with cutting-edge tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Freedom and Voyager-class ships</strong> strike a middle ground—enough variety to keep days interesting
        without overwhelming crowds. They often offer the best value, especially for solo travelers and couples.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Radiance and Vision-class ships</strong> provide more intimate experiences with fewer passengers.
        Perfect if you prefer quieter spaces, easier navigation, and less competition for pool chairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider your itinerary, desired amenities, tolerance for crowds, and budget when selecting. Each class
        has its own rhythm—choose the one that matches yours.
      </p>

      <h3>What's the difference between Oasis-class and Icon-class ships?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Icon-class ships</strong> (Icon of the Seas, Star of the Seas) are Royal Caribbean's newest and
        largest vessels at 250,800 gross tons. They feature the latest innovations including Thrill Island with
        waterslides, Category 6 water park (the largest at sea), the AquaDome entertainment space with panoramic
        ocean views, and redesigned neighborhood concepts that improve flow and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Oasis-class ships</strong> (Wonder, Symphony, Harmony, Allure, Oasis of the Seas) range from
        225,282 to 236,857 gross tons and pioneered the neighborhood concept with seven distinct zones including
        Central Park (with live trees), the Boardwalk (with a hand-carved carousel), and the iconic AquaTheater
        for high-diving shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        While both classes offer extensive amenities, Icon-class ships feature more modern design, enhanced
        sustainability features (including LNG fuel capability), better crowd flow, and the newest entertainment
        technologies. Oasis-class ships remain incredibly popular and proven, with more sailing options across
        different homeports.
      </p>

      <h3>Which is the newest Royal Caribbean ship?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Star of the Seas</strong> is the newest Royal Caribbean ship, debuting in <strong>2025</strong>.
        Icon of the Seas, which launched in 2024, is the newest ship currently in service. Both are Icon-class
        vessels and represent the latest chapter in cruise ship design—larger, more sustainable, and packed with
        innovations learned from decades of sailing.
      </p>

      <h3>Which is the largest Royal Caribbean ship?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Icon of the Seas</strong> and <strong>Star of the Seas</strong> are the largest Royal Caribbean
        ships at <strong>250,800 gross tons</strong> with capacity for <strong>7,600 passengers</strong>. These
        Icon-class vessels surpass the previous record holders from the Oasis class, which range from 225,282 to
        236,857 gross tons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Size matters for amenities—more space means more restaurants, more pools, more entertainment venues, and
        more room to breathe even at full capacity. But bigger doesn't always mean better. Some travelers prefer
        the cozier feel of smaller ships where you can walk the entire deck in minutes and recognize faces by day three.
      </p>

      <h3>Where can I view deck plans for Royal Caribbean ships?</h3>
      <p>
        Official deck plans are available at
        <a href="https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/ships/deck-plans" rel="noopener external">Royal Caribbean's deck plans page</a>.
        Deck plans help you study the ship's layout, locate your stateroom in relation to elevators and dining venues,
        find quiet corners away from high-traffic areas, and plan your route before you step aboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pro tip: Print or save your ship's deck plan to your phone. On embarkation day when you're trying to find
        your cabin with luggage in tow, a quick glance at the layout saves wandering.
