        <h1>Koh Samui: Where Golden Buddhas Meet Turquoise Water</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Koh Samui feels like Thailand took everything beautiful — golden temple spires, palm-fringed beaches the color of postcards, waterfalls tumbling over purple rocks, the gentle smile of Buddhist hospitality — and concentrated it all on one 90-square-mile island in the Gulf of Thailand. The ship anchors offshore at sunrise, the Big Buddha gleaming gold on the northern headland, a 79-foot beacon of calm watching over the island's morning prayers and beach bar happy hours with equal benevolence.</p>

          <p>We tender to Nathon Pier on the western coast, a working waterfront where fishing boats unload the morning catch and longtail boats bob in the gentle swells. The town spreads along the shoreline — low buildings painted in faded pastels, shophouses selling everything from coconut candy to Buddha amulets, street vendors grilling satay skewers over charcoal. This is not the resort side of Samui. This is where islanders actually live, and it's all the more charming for it.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Climbing the 72 steps to the Big Buddha on a humid morning, sweat already soaking through my shirt, and reaching the platform where the massive golden statue sits in the Mara posture — the moment of enlightenment, one hand touching the earth to witness Buddha's victory over temptation. Below, the Gulf of Thailand stretched impossibly blue. A Thai grandmother lit three incense sticks, bowed three times with her palms pressed together, and smiled at me with such genuine warmth I felt blessed just standing there. The Buddha wasn't looking at us. He was looking through us, past us, at something eternal. And somehow that was more comforting than any blessing could be.
          </div>

          <p>Koh Samui has beaches like other islands have pebbles. Chaweng Beach unfurls for 5 kilometers along the eastern coast — powder-white sand, gentle turquoise water, beach clubs where you can rent a daybed and watch the long afternoon pass in increments measured by mango shakes and fresh coconut. Bophut Beach offers something quieter: Fisherman's Village, a preserved strip of old wooden shophouses converted into boutiques and cafes, where you can still watch fishermen mend nets in the morning and browse handmade jewelry in the afternoon.</p>

          <p>But the temples — the temples are what make Samui more than just another pretty beach. Wat Plai Laem sits on the northeastern shore, its Chinese-Thai architecture a riot of red and gold, featuring an 18-armed statue of Guanyin, the goddess of compassion and mercy, rising above a lake filled with catfish the size of small dogs that swarm when visitors toss food pellets. Nearby, Wat Khunaram houses the mummified remains of Loung Pordaeng, a revered monk who passed in 1973 while meditating. He sits there still, preserved behind glass, wearing sunglasses someone thoughtfully added to shield his spirit from flash photography. It's strange and sacred all at once.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time on this island of Buddhas and beaches.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Big Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Yai)</h4>
          <p>The island's most iconic sight — a 79-foot tall golden Buddha statue seated in the Mara posture, commemorating enlightenment. Climb 72 steps to the platform for views of the northern coast and Gulf of Thailand. Free entry (donations welcome). Dress modestly — shoulders and knees covered required. 30-60 minutes. The Buddha watches sunrise over the water, patient and golden, and has done so since 1972.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Wat Plai Laem</h4>
          <p>Chinese-Thai temple complex featuring an 18-armed statue of Guanyin, the goddess of compassion and mercy. Ornate red and gold architecture, peaceful lake, enormous catfish you can feed. Free entry. Nearby to Big Buddha — combine the visits. 30-45 minutes. The Guanyin statue radiates serenity; each of her 18 arms holds a symbol of compassion.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Chaweng Beach</h4>
          <p>Koh Samui's longest and liveliest beach — 5 km of white sand, turquoise water, beach clubs, restaurants, shopping. Best for swimming, water sports, people-watching. Beach chair rental ~100 baht. Mango shakes and fresh coconut everywhere. Half-day minimum if you want to understand why people never leave this island.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Bophut Fisherman's Village</h4>
          <p>Historic fishing village with preserved wooden shophouses converted into boutiques, cafes, restaurants. Quieter beach, authentic island atmosphere, Friday night walking street market (if your ship stays late). Walking street features local food, crafts, live music. Perfect for late afternoon stroll after temple visits.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Na Muang Waterfalls</h4>
          <p>Tallest waterfalls on the island, cascading over distinctive purple rocks (na muang means "purple stone"). Na Muang 1 is easier to reach; Na Muang 2 requires hiking but offers natural pools for swimming. Inland in rainforest. 20-30 min taxi from Nathon. Half-day excursion. Bring swimsuit and water shoes.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Secret Buddha Garden (Magic Garden)</h4>
          <p>Hidden garden in the island's interior hills, featuring dozens of statues depicting Buddha's life, deities, and animals — all created by one farmer over 20 years starting in 1976. Small waterfalls, lush jungle setting. Requires 4WD or scooter (steep rough roads). Entry ~80 baht. 1 hour visit. Wonderfully eccentric and peaceful.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Nathon Town walkable from pier (10-15 min). Beaches and temples require transportation. Sidewalks limited outside Nathon.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Wait at pier; negotiate fare before departure (no meters). Expect ~300-500 baht to Big Buddha, ~500-700 baht to Chaweng Beach. Agree on round-trip price if driver waits.</li>
            <li><strong>Songthaew:</strong> Pickup trucks with bench seats — local shared transport (~50 baht to Big Buddha). Flag down along main roads. Cheapest option but less convenient for cruise passengers on tight schedules.</li>
            <li><strong>Scooter Rental:</strong> Popular with adventurous travelers (~200 baht/day). Roads generally good but hilly. International license required. Helmets mandatory (500 baht fine).</li>
            <li><strong>Tours:</strong> Shore excursions available through ship or local operators. Island loop tours typically include Big Buddha, temples, viewpoints, and beach stop.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Grilled prawns, whole fish, squid — caught that morning, grilled over charcoal, served with spicy lime sauce. Beachfront restaurants specialize.</li>
            <li><strong>Coconut-Based Cuisine:</strong> Coconut palms cover the island (Koh Samui means "Coconut Island"). Coconut milk curries, coconut ice cream, fresh coconut water served in the shell.</li>
            <li><strong>Pad Thai & Tom Yum:</strong> Thai classics done well everywhere. Tom Yum soup (hot and sour with lemongrass) particularly good with fresh Gulf shrimp.</li>
            <li><strong>Mango Fruit Shakes:</strong> Fresh mango blended with ice — sweet, cold, perfect for tropical heat. Available at every beach stand and cafe.</li>
            <li><strong>Kalamae:</strong> Traditional sticky coconut candy wrapped in palm leaves. Sweet, chewy, made with coconut milk and palm sugar. Buy at Nathon markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Thai Massage:</strong> Not food, but part of the experience — traditional Thai massage $7-10 at beach shops. One hour of blessed relief after temple climbing.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dress modestly for temples — shoulders and knees covered. Bring a light scarf or sarong. Shoes removed before entering temple buildings.</li>
            <li>Taxi drivers don't use meters — negotiate the full price before getting in. Ask locals or ship staff for current fair prices.</li>
            <li>Big Buddha and Wat Plai Laem are 5 minutes apart — combine them in one taxi trip (30 min from Nathon Pier).</li>
            <li>Lipa Noi Beach (south of Nathon) is underrated — quiet, beautiful sunsets, 10-15 min taxi from pier. Great if you just want beach time without the crowds.</li>
            <li>Thai Baht strongly preferred for taxis, markets, street food. ATMs available in Nathon near the 7-Eleven (yes, they're everywhere).</li>
            <li>Songthaews are cheap but unpredictable schedules — fine for independent travelers with time, but taxis more practical for cruise passengers.</li>
            <li>Ang Thong National Marine Park (42 islands) requires full-day boat trip — only possible if ship docks overnight or you skip it for next time.</li>
            <li>Beach vendors sell fresh fruit — try rambutan (red hairy fruit), mangosteen (purple shell, white segments), dragon fruit. All ridiculously fresh.</li>
            <li>Respect Buddha images — never climb on statues, point feet at Buddha, or turn your back for selfies. Thais are gentle but observant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Author's Note</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake—charts drawn from research, captain's wisdom, and the accounts of fellow travelers. I write them knowing that the truest understanding comes only when you stand on the pier, smell the salt air, and trace the streets with your own feet. When my anchor finally drops here, I'll return to these pages and tell you what I found.</p>
        </aside>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to Nathon Pier on the western coast. Tender ride takes about 10 minutes. Taxis wait at the pier.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How long to visit Big Buddha?</strong><br/>A: Plan 30-60 minutes. The climb takes 5 minutes, but you'll want time to walk around, take photos, and absorb the peace. Combined with nearby Wat Plai Laem, allow 90 minutes total.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Which beach should I choose?</strong><br/>A: Chaweng Beach for lively atmosphere and facilities (30 min from pier). Bophut for historic Fisherman's Village charm (25 min). Lipa Noi for quiet sunset beach closest to Nathon (15 min).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I rent a scooter for the day?</strong><br/>A: Yes, ~200 baht/day, but you need an international driver's license. Roads are decent but hilly. Helmets mandatory. Taxis easier for cruise passengers with limited time.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What should I wear to temples?</strong><br/>A: Cover shoulders and knees. Remove shoes before entering buildings. Lightweight pants or long skirt + scarf for shoulders works in tropical heat.</p>
