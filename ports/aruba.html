        <h2>Aruba: One Happy Island With the Perfect Beaches</h2>

        <p class="answer-line" style="margin: 0.75rem 0 1.5rem; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--rope, #d9b382); background: #f7fdff; border-radius: 8px;">
          <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Aruba is "One Happy Island" with Eagle Beach (consistently ranked top-3 in the world), Baby Beach snorkeling, colorful Dutch colonial architecture, and the best sunset catamarans in the Caribbean. Trade winds keep it perfect year-round.
        </p>

        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>Sailing into Oranjestad feels like entering a Caribbean postcard painted by someone who really, really loves color. The Dutch colonial buildings pop in every shade of coral, yellow, and turquoise. Flamingos dot the horizon. And those famous trade winds — the ones that keep this desert island comfortable year-round — are already ruffling my hair before I'm off the gangway.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The first thing that strikes you stepping off the ship is the <strong>welcome</strong> — steel pan music fills the air, and carnival dancers in brilliant feathered costumes wave you into One Happy Island. The Dutch colonial buildings of Oranjestad pop in every shade of coral, yellow, and turquoise, their bright facades a reminder that this island has been welcoming visitors for centuries. The main shopping district along Caya G.F. Betico Croes is pedestrian-friendly and shaded, perfect for a morning wander before the sun gets too intense.</p>
          </div>

          <p>My perfect Aruba day starts early at <strong>Eagle Beach</strong> — and I mean early, before 9 a.m. Those famous fofoti (divi-divi) trees, bent permanently by the trade winds, are even more photogenic in the soft morning light. The powder-white sand stretches for miles, and the water is that impossible turquoise that makes you question your camera settings. I rent loungers from one of the beach operators (great value for a full day) and float for hours.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing waist-deep at Baby Beach, watching a school of blue tang swim right between my legs like I'm part of their world. The water was so clear I could count individual fish scales. This is what "One Happy Island" actually means.
          </div>

          <div class="clearfix">
            <figure class="inline-image-left" style="float: left; width: 45%; max-width: 320px; margin: 0 1.5rem 1rem 0;">

            </figure>
            <p>The island's famous <strong>flamingos</strong> are everywhere — wading through the shallows at Renaissance Island, posing for photos, and reminding you that this is one of those rare places where the wildlife seems to love the tourists as much as we love them. Around noon, I usually taxi to <strong>Palm Beach</strong> for the high-rise hotel energy and lunch at <strong>Eduardo's Beach Shack</strong> — their truffle tuna poke bowl has ruined all other poke bowls for me forever. Palm Beach is more developed than Eagle, with beach bars and water sports rentals lining the shore, but it has its own kind of fun, especially if you're traveling with kids who want jet skis and banana boats.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Afternoon is decision time: <strong>Baby Beach</strong> or sunset catamaran? Baby Beach is worth the 45-minute drive to Aruba's southern tip — a protected lagoon with calm, crystal-clear water perfect for snorkeling. The reef here is healthy and the marine life abundant. But if you've been on your feet all day, the sunset catamarans that depart from Palm Beach are pure magic. I'm a fan of the snorkel-and-drinks tours that include open bar and music while the sun melts into the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Dinner is at <strong>The West Deck</strong> on the Linear Park waterfront — grilled wahoo with Creole sauce and fried plantains while watching the sky turn orange, pink, and purple. For the best keshi yena (stuffed cheese, Aruba's national dish), The Old Cunucu House out in the countryside is worth the trip.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>The Cruise Port</h3>
          <p>Aruba's cruise facility in Oranjestad has four berths that can handle up to five ships simultaneously, with three modern, air-conditioned terminals. Inside you'll find tourist information counters, gift shops, restrooms, free WiFi, and coffee. The walk to Lloyd G. Smith Boulevard (the main waterfront street) takes 5–10 minutes depending on which pier you're at.</p>
          <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> A free trolley runs between the cruise port and downtown, making six stops along the way past museums and monuments. It's a great orientation ride if you're not in a rush.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Getting Around Aruba</h3>
          <p>The cruise terminal is a 5-minute walk <span class="distance-fun">approximately 33 school buses, 16 blue whales end-to-end, or 352 emperor penguins stacked skyward</span> from downtown Oranjestad. The historic center is compact and pedestrian-friendly — perfect for exploring on foot. From there:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Oranjestad is wonderfully walkable, with shaded streets and colorful architecture around every corner. Most shops and restaurants in the main district are within a 10-minute stroll of each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Trolley:</strong> Runs between the port and downtown shopping areas with 6 stops — perfect for a quick orientation and avoiding the midday heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Arubus (Public Bus):</strong> The L10A line runs every 20 minutes along the northwest coast, hitting Eagle Beach, Palm Beach, Malmok, and Arashi Beach. Service runs until 9 p.m. Single rides cost around $2.60, or grab a $5 round-trip ticket to any beach — outstanding value.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> All taxis use fixed government rates with no meters, so prices are transparent and consistent. Downtown to Palm Beach runs about $11. Multi-person tours to the California Lighthouse and Casibari rock formations cost around $20 per person for a 2.5-hour loop.</li>
            <li><strong>Eagle Beach:</strong> About $12–15 by taxi, or grab the L10A bus for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li><strong>Palm Beach:</strong> Quick $10–12 taxi ride. Buses also run this route frequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Baby Beach:</strong> 45-minute drive to the southern tip. Best with a rental car or organized tour.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rentals:</strong> Widely available if you want to explore independently. Traffic drives on the right side of the road (same as the U.S.). Jeeps are popular for exploring the rugged north coast and Natural Pool. Book in advance during high season.</li>

          <h3>Beaches Near the Port</h3>
          <p>If you don't want to taxi or bus, you've got options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Surfside Beach:</strong> The closest beach to the cruise port — about a 15-minute walk. Turn right on Lloyd G. Smith Boulevard and keep going. Small but swimmable.</li>
            <li><strong>Governor's Bay Beach:</strong> Just over the bridge from Wilhelmina Park. A quiet cove with calm, shallow water — perfect for a quick dip without the taxi fare.</li>
            <li><strong>Arashi Beach:</strong> At the northwest tip near the California Lighthouse. Crystal-blue water, white sand, public palapas, and uncrowded vibes. Worth the bus ride.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Beyond the Beach</h3>
          <p>Not a beach person? Or maybe you've done Eagle Beach before and want something different this time. Aruba has options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fort Zoutman Historical Museum:</strong> Aruba's oldest building (dating to 1798) sits right in downtown Oranjestad. Climb the Willem III Tower for harbor views and explore exhibits on the island's colonial past, indigenous heritage, and maritime history.</li>
            <li><strong>Archaeological Museum:</strong> Just 0.3 miles from the terminals — an easy add before or after lunch downtown. Surprisingly impressive for a small island, with collections spanning 2500 BC to modern day. Free admission.</li>
            <li><strong>Arikok National Park:</strong> This protected wilderness covers nearly 20% of the island with dramatic desert landscapes, towering cacti, indigenous wildlife, and unique rock formations. Hiking trails range from easy walks to challenging scrambles. The Natural Bridge ruins and Natural Pool are highlights — best reached by 4x4 or guided tour.</li>
            <li><strong>Ostrich Farm:</strong> Get up close with these giant birds on a guided tour that includes feeding opportunities and learning about ostrich behavior. A quirky, family-friendly attraction that's surprisingly entertaining.</li>
            <li><strong>Butterfly Farm:</strong> About 4 miles from port. Walk through a tropical garden while butterflies from around the world land on you. A gentler morning for families with small kids.</li>
            <li><strong>Atlantis Submarine:</strong> Descend 130 feet below the surface in a real submarine to explore coral reefs, shipwrecks, and tropical fish without getting wet. One of the Caribbean's most unique excursions — book ahead as these tours fill up fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Eagle Beach and White Sand Beaches:</strong> Beyond the famous Eagle Beach, you'll find Arashi Beach (quiet and uncrowded), Manchebo Beach (calm and wide), and Druif Beach (great for long walks). Each has its own personality, but all share that signature powder-white sand.</li>
            <li><strong>Donkey Sanctuary:</strong> Six miles out, a rescue haven where you can feed and pet friendly donkeys. Combine with the Natural Bridge for a non-beach half-day.</li>
            <li><strong>California Lighthouse:</strong> At the island's northwest tip. Great views and a nice spot to catch sunset — an alternative to the catamaran if you'd rather stay on land.</li>
            <li><strong>Island Tours:</strong> Half-day island tours (around 2.5 hours) typically cost about $20 per person and hit the major landmarks — California Lighthouse, Natural Bridge, Casibari Rock Formations, and Alto Vista Chapel. Great way to see a lot if you're short on time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-top: 0.75rem; color: #678;">Pick one or two. You can't do everything in a port day, and Aruba is worth coming back to.</p>

          <h3>Shopping in Oranjestad</h3>
          <p>Aruba is one of the Caribbean's premier shopping destinations, and the <strong>Renaissance Marketplace</strong> right at the port makes it ridiculously convenient. You'll find high-end Swiss watches, French perfumes, fine jewelry, designer fashion, Dutch Delft pottery, Indonesian batiks, and locally-made aloe vera products (Aruba is famous for its aloe). Look for Gouda cheese, Dutch liqueurs, and Cuban cigars as well. The pedestrian-friendly main streets (Caya G.F. Betico Croes) are shaded and pleasant for wandering between purchases, with local boutiques mixed among the international brands.</p>

          <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> The official currency is the Aruban Florin (AFL/AWG), but U.S. dollars are accepted literally everywhere — hotels, restaurants, shops, taxis. Credit cards are widely accepted as well. You rarely need to exchange money.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Papiamento is the local language (a blend of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and African influences), but you'll have zero communication issues. Dutch and English are official languages, and Spanish is widely understood. Most locals speak at least three languages fluently.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Aruba sits outside the hurricane belt, so weather is remarkably consistent year-round — hovering around 81°F (27°C) with constant trade winds. You can visit any month without worrying about storms.</li>
            <li><strong>Trade Winds:</strong> Nature's air conditioning! They keep the island comfortable but will give you epic beach hair.</li>
            <li><strong>Free WiFi:</strong> Available at the Renaissance Mall and many restaurants and cafes downtown. Most cruise ship plans also work well in Aruba.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> One of the safest islands in the Caribbean — one of the lowest crime rates in the region. Tourist areas are comfortable for walking, even at night.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> The trade winds mask how intense the sun is. You will burn faster than you expect. Reapply constantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Flamingos:</strong> Yes, they're real, and yes, they hang out at Renaissance Island. Day passes available but pricey.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Eagle Beach really that good?</strong><br/>
          A: Yes! It's consistently ranked among the top 3 beaches in the world for good reason. The powder-white sand, iconic fofoti trees, and turquoise water are even more stunning in person. Go early to beat the crowds.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What is the best snorkeling in Aruba?</strong><br/>
          A: Baby Beach on the southern tip offers the best shore snorkeling — a protected lagoon with calm, crystal-clear water and abundant marine life. Worth the 45-minute drive.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Aruba safe for walking at night?</strong><br/>
          A: Absolutely! Aruba is one of the safest islands in the Caribbean. Oranjestad, Palm Beach, and Eagle Beach are all comfortable for evening strolls.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What's the cheapest way to get to the beaches?</strong><br/>
          A: The public Arubus L10A line runs every 20 minutes and costs just $5 round-trip to Eagle Beach, Palm Beach, or any beach on the northwest coast. Hard to beat.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is there a beach I can walk to from the ship?</strong><br/>
          A: Yes! Surfside Beach is about a 15-minute walk from the cruise port. Governor's Bay Beach is also walkable, just over the bridge from Wilhelmina Park.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Where can I find the best keshi yena?</strong><br/>
          A: The Old Cunucu House in the countryside serves the most authentic version of this stuffed-cheese national dish. It's a proper Aruban experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Will I get caught in a hurricane?</strong><br/>
          A: Very unlikely! Aruba sits outside the Caribbean hurricane belt, which is why the weather is so consistently good year-round.</p>
