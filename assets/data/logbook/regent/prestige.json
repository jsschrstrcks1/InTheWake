      "markdown": "**I've sailed Regent solo for eight years, ever since my divorce liberated me from a marriage where I'd forgotten my own preferences. When Seven Seas Prestige was announced, I knew immediately: I would be aboard her inaugural voyage, alone and perfectly happy.**\n\nThe decision wasn't impulsive. I've spent years learning what solo travel requires and what Regent delivers. The Explorer Class ships taught me that ultra-luxury and solo traveling aren't contradictory\u2014they're complementary. A ship that treats every guest as worthy of attention naturally treats solo travelers as complete rather than incomplete.\n\nMy anticipation for Prestige centers on what the new ship promises. Larger capacity\u2014850 guests\u2014means slightly less intimate than Navigator but still manageable for solo travelers who want to be known without being overwhelming. The enhanced Compass Rose and expanded specialty dining venues mean more opportunities for those evening meals where solo status becomes social advantage rather than awkwardness.\n\nI've learned that inaugural voyages attract particular passengers\u2014experienced cruisers willing to pay premium prices, travel enthusiasts excited about new ships, Regent loyalists who want to witness the next chapter. These aren't the honeymooners and anniversary celebrants who dominate other voyages. They're people with interesting stories, comfortable with solo travelers, eager for shipboard conversation.\n\nThe all-inclusive model matters especially on inaugural sailings. The crew will be learning the ship\u2014inevitable growing pains in new venues, unfamiliar traffic patterns, systems still being optimized. When everything is included, these imperfections become stories rather than frustrations. You're not calculating whether the learning curve diminished your value. You're participating in history.\n\nI called my Regent travel advisor the day Prestige bookings opened. She's known me for years\u2014understands my preferences for quieter deck locations, my love of afternoon tea, my need for crew who remember names quickly. She secured my Penthouse Suite on the inaugural Mediterranean voyage before I'd even reviewed the itinerary.\n\n'You don't need to know where you're going,' she said. 'You need to know you're there from the beginning.'\n\nShe was right. I've sailed Mediterranean ports dozens of times. What I've never done is watch a Regent ship find her identity, experience crew developing rhythms, witness the moment when a vessel transforms from new construction to living community.\n\nMy solo status will serve me well on Prestige's inaugural. Without a travel companion's preferences to negotiate, I can explore freely\u2014try every venue, join every activity, talk to every willing fellow passenger. I'll document the ship's first days for fellow solo travelers considering future voyages.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige represents Regent's future. I want to be part of that future from day one. When Prestige matures into the fleet's flagship, I'll remember when she was new, when we were all learning her together, when solo travelers like me helped shape her culture.\n\nThe wait feels eternal. But I've been waiting eight years to find a ship worth being first aboard. Prestige is that ship.\n\nI'll report back after the inaugural. Solo travelers, save your deposits. This is the one.\n\n**The lesson:** Solitude doesn't have to mean isolation.",

We've been planning for three years\u2014four generations, fourteen family members, the newest Regent ship. Nothing less would honor the woman who taught us to travel beautifully.**\n\nMom has sailed every Regent ship since Mariner's launch in 2001. She introduced me to cruising when I was reluctant, taught my children that travel was education, and insisted that grandchildren deserved the same quality she'd experienced. Her standard has always been Regent. For her milestone birthday, only their newest ship would do.\n\nThe logistical planning required extensive coordination. Four generations means radically different needs\u2014my 80-year-old mother, my husband and me in our fifties, our adult children and their spouses in their twenties, and three grandchildren under ten. Explorer Class ships accommodated us adequately. Prestige's expanded capacity\u2014850 guests with enhanced family amenities\u2014promises to serve us better.\n\nI've studied every available detail about Prestige's design. The expanded suite categories mean we can book interconnecting accommodations that keep grandchildren near parents while giving grandparents necessary quiet. The enhanced Compass Rose promises tables large enough for our entire family without the cramped configurations smaller ships require. The expanded specialty dining venues\u2014rumored to include new concepts beyond the established Prime 7 and Chartreuse\u2014mean we can celebrate Mom's birthday across multiple culinary experiences.\n\nThe all-inclusive model becomes essential with fourteen family members spanning four generations. I've organized multi-generational trips where cost allocation caused resentment\u2014who pays for the children's excursions, whether grandparents should subsidize adult children's wine consumption, the endless calculations that poison family harmony. Regent eliminates these negotiations. Everything is included for everyone. Mom's birthday gift to the family is freedom from financial tension.\n\nThe shore excursions promise particular value. Prestige's inaugural Mediterranean itinerary includes ports we've visited before, but unlimited excursions mean we can experience them differently. My adventurous twenty-somethings can kayak while grandparents take gentle walking tours. Children can explore age-appropriate activities while parents enjoy wine tastings. Nobody compromises. Everyone experiences destinations according to their abilities and interests.\n\nMy mother doesn't know about the planning. She knows we're 'considering' a cruise for her birthday. She doesn't know that fourteen family members have been coordinating for three years, that deposits were placed before Prestige's keel was laid, that her travel advisor has been receiving monthly updates on construction progress.\n\nThe reveal will come at her 79th birthday dinner. We'll present a mock-up of our Prestige suite arrangement, an itinerary of the ports she's dreamed about, and the knowledge that her entire family prioritized being together on the ship that represents Regent's future.\n\nI expect tears. I'm already crying as I write this.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige will be new, untested, finding her rhythms. But our family will find our rhythms too\u2014four generations learning a ship together, making memories that outlast any inaugural-voyage imperfections.\n\nMom taught us that travel creates family. Prestige will create the memory we'll share forever.\n\n**The lesson:** Multi-generational travel works when the ship works harder than your family does.",

I think we're starting our marriage the way we intend to continue\u2014with ambition and beauty.**\n\nMichael and I met on a cruise\u2014not Regent, unfortunately, but the experience taught us both that we were travelers who valued quality over quantity. Our early dates were planning future trips. Our engagement happened overlooking the Mediterranean from a hotel balcony. Our life together will be built on shared adventures.\n\nWhen Regent announced Prestige, I saw our honeymoon. Michael worried about booking a ship that didn't exist yet\u2014what if construction delays affected our wedding timeline? What if inaugural-voyage kinks diminished the experience? What if we'd invested thousands in a ship that disappointed?\n\nI addressed each concern systematically. Regent's construction timeline allowed buffer room around our wedding date. Inaugural voyages attract premium passengers and heightened crew attention\u2014the 'kinks' would be offset by exceptional service focus. And Regent's track record suggested Prestige would meet or exceed expectations.\n\nMichael remained skeptical until I showed him the preliminary renderings. The enhanced Regent Suite designs. The expanded wellness facilities. The new dining concepts. The promise that Prestige would represent Regent's most ambitious expression yet.\n\n'Our marriage should be ambitious,' I argued. 'Why shouldn't our honeymoon match?'\n\nHe agreed. We booked.\n\nThe anticipation has become part of our wedding planning. While other couples stress about centerpieces, we research Prestige's announced amenities. While friends debate reception venues, we analyze itinerary options. Our honeymoon isn't an afterthought\u2014it's the adventure that wedding logistics merely precede.\n\nThe all-inclusive model particularly appeals to us. We're paying for our own wedding\u2014no parental support, no family money\u2014and the honeymoon budget is fixed. Knowing that Prestige includes everything means our honeymoon won't require the budgeting vigilance that wedding planning has demanded. For two weeks, we'll simply exist in luxury without calculating costs.\n\nThe unlimited shore excursions promise honeymoon adventures we couldn't otherwise afford. Every port becomes opportunity rather than expense. We've already researched Prestige's inaugural destinations\u2014Mediterranean ports we've dreamed about, experiences we've postponed for 'someday.' Someday becomes honeymoon.\n\nMy vision for our first married days: waking in a Prestige suite, breakfast on our balcony watching new destinations emerge, exploring ports together, returning to a ship we're discovering alongside 850 fellow passengers on her inaugural season. Our marriage begins as Prestige begins\u2014both relationships finding their rhythms, both futures unwritten.\n\nMichael has caught my enthusiasm. He now checks Regent's website for Prestige updates more frequently than I do. He's researching inaugural-voyage passenger communities, wondering who else will share our honeymoon ship. He's invested.\n\nWe're starting our marriage on a ship that's starting her service. The parallel delights me. Prestige and Michael and I will grow together, all of us becoming whatever we're meant to become.\n\nThe wedding will be beautiful. The honeymoon will be the beginning of everything else.\n\n**The lesson:** The best honeymoon isn't the one you planned\u2014it's the one that teaches you partnership through challenge.",

They worry about my health, my age, my ability to handle a new ship's learning curve. They don't understand that Prestige might be my last chance to see the future.**\n\nI've sailed with Regent since before they were Regent\u2014back when Radisson Seven Seas still owned the fleet. I witnessed Navigator's intimate revolution, Mariner's all-suite innovation, Voyager's all-balcony transformation. I sailed Explorer's inaugural season and watched her sisters Splendor and Grandeur continue the evolution. I've seen this cruise line grow from ambitious newcomer to ultra-luxury leader.\n\nPrestige represents the next chapter. At eighty-two, I may not be here for the chapter after. If I want to witness Regent's future, Prestige's inaugural season is my opportunity.\n\nThe health concerns are valid but manageable. My cardiologist has cleared me for travel. My mobility limitations\u2014cane required, stamina reduced\u2014have been accommodated beautifully on previous Regent voyages. The accessibility coordination that impressed me on Grandeur will presumably translate to Prestige with enhancements appropriate to newer design.\n\nThe 'learning curve' my children fear actually appeals to me. Yes, new ships have imperfections\u2014crew still learning traffic patterns, systems not yet optimized, inevitable adjustment periods. But inaugural voyages also bring heightened attention. When everything is new, everyone tries harder. I've experienced inaugural seasons before. The effort surpasses the imperfections.\n\nMy travel advisor understands my priorities. She's booking me a Penthouse Suite on Prestige's inaugural Mediterranean voyage\u2014the same category I've sailed since Explorer, positioned for the views and accessibility I require. She's coordinated with Regent's special services team to ensure my needs are documented before crew assignments are finalized. By embarkation, my butler will know my morning routine, my dining preferences, my afternoon tea requirements.\n\nThe all-inclusive model matters especially at my age. I don't want to spend potentially limited years calculating value. I want to experience beauty without spreadsheets. Regent has always delivered that freedom. Prestige promises to expand it.\n\nMy children's deepest worry remains unspoken: what if something happens to me aboard a ship far from home? I've addressed this directly with my travel advisor. Medical evacuation coverage is in place. My advance directives are current. My family has full itinerary access. If my time comes aboard Prestige, I will be among people who've spent years caring for travelers like me.\n\nThere are worse ways to go than watching the Mediterranean from a Regent balcony.\n\nBut I expect to return from Prestige's inaugural with stories, not endings. I expect to tell my grandchildren about the newest expression of ultra-luxury cruising. I expect to watch crew find their rhythms and passengers become community. I expect to witness the future of the cruise line I've loved for decades.\n\nAt eighty-two, witnessing the future feels like privilege, not foolishness.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige represents what Regent will become. I want to be there when she becomes it.\n\n**The lesson:** Age is irrelevant when luxury means respect.",

I've just booked Prestige's inaugural for myself. Not a memorial. A beginning.**\n\nRobert and I were Regent loyalists for decades. We sailed every ship in the fleet at least once. When Grandeur was announced, the inaugural voyage seemed perfect for our milestone anniversary\u2014the newest ship for forty years of marriage.\n\nHe died six weeks before departure. I cancelled everything and assumed I'd never cruise again.\n\nGrief counseling taught me that assumptions need examination. A support group for widows introduced me to women who'd returned to travel, who'd reclaimed experiences death had threatened to steal. One woman described her first solo cruise\u2014terrifying, then liberating, then essential to her recovery.\n\nI rebooked Grandeur the following year. Solo. Prepared for grief to overwhelm me. Instead, the ship I'd planned to share with Robert became the ship where I learned I could travel without him. The crew accommodated my tears without excessive attention. Fellow passengers offered connection without intrusion. By voyage end, I'd laughed genuinely for the first time in months.\n\nI've cruised Regent three times since\u2014Grandeur twice, Splendor once\u2014each voyage strengthening the identity I'm building as a solo traveler. Robert is always present. But he's present as companion to my adventures, not obstacle to them.\n\nPrestige represents the next step. Not because I need a newer ship, but because I need the symbolism of beginning. Prestige will be finding her identity as I continue finding mine. We'll both be new versions of ourselves, testing capabilities, establishing rhythms, becoming whatever we're meant to become.\n\nThe inaugural voyage appeals specifically because it lacks Robert's memory. He never saw Prestige renderings, never discussed her specifications, never planned which suite category we'd book. This ship belongs to the woman I'm becoming, not the woman I was when we traveled together.\n\nMy travel advisor understood immediately when I explained my reasoning. She's booked me a Concierge Suite\u2014smaller than the Penthouse Robert and I preferred, but appropriate for solo travel and my evolving preferences. She's connected me with fellow solo travelers considering Prestige's inaugural, potential companions for dining and excursions without the obligation of constant togetherness.\n\nThe all-inclusive model remains essential. I don't want to calculate whether experiences are 'worth it' when my emotional capacity is devoted to navigating new territory. Unlimited excursions mean I can say yes to adventures Robert would have enjoyed, experiencing ports for both of us without financial anxiety.\n\nPrestige will carry Robert's memory. I'll toast him at the Compass Rose, order the wines he loved at Prime 7, watch sunsets from my balcony and imagine his commentary. But Prestige will also carry the woman I'm becoming\u2014someone capable of booking inaugural voyages alone, someone who sees new beginnings as opportunity rather than terror.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige launches into service the same season I launch into my fourth year of widowhood. We're both becoming something new.\n\nRobert would be proud of the woman boarding that ship. I'm learning to be proud of her too.\n\n**The lesson:** Grief doesn't heal on a schedule, but it needs beautiful places to breathe.",

I'm forty-four now, and I've watched accessibility in cruising evolve from afterthought to consideration to, occasionally, genuine inclusion. Seven Seas Prestige represents what I've been waiting for: a ship designed from inception with travelers like me in mind.**\n\nThe distinction matters enormously. Older ships retrofitted for accessibility inevitably compromise\u2014routes that feel like service corridors, 'accessible' suites that sacrifice luxury for functionality, accommodations that work but never delight. New construction eliminates these compromises. When accessibility is designed rather than added, the results are transformative.\n\nI've sailed Regent's Explorer Class ships with positive experiences. The accessibility coordination was thorough. The crew was attentive. The accommodations functioned well. But I always felt the adaptations\u2014the routes that differed from able-bodied passengers, the restaurants where my positioning options were limited, the shore excursions where accessibility was solved rather than celebrated.\n\nPrestige promises something different. I've studied every available detail about her design specifications. The preliminary accessibility documentation suggests suites where wheelchair users experience the same views, same luxury, same beauty as any other guest. The public space plans show routing that integrates rather than segregates. The shore excursion protocols anticipate accessibility as standard rather than special request.\n\nThe enhanced medical facilities particularly interest me. Regent has always handled disability well\u2014their medical teams understand complex needs, their coordination with specialized equipment providers is thorough. Prestige's expanded medical capabilities suggest even more comprehensive support for travelers whose disabilities require ongoing attention.\n\nI've booked a Penthouse Suite on Prestige's inaugural season. My travel advisor specializes in accessible luxury travel and has been in direct communication with Regent's design team. The suite assigned to me will be among the first genuinely luxury accessible accommodations on any ultra-luxury ship\u2014not a retrofitted compromise, but designed from blueprint to serve travelers like me beautifully.\n\nThe all-inclusive model matters especially for accessible travelers. Medical equipment transport, specialized shore excursion arrangements, dietary accommodations for disability-related needs\u2014these often incur additional costs elsewhere. Regent's comprehensive inclusion eliminates the financial anxiety that compounds disability's other burdens.\n\nMy anticipation extends beyond personal benefit. Prestige represents an industry statement. When the newest, most ambitious ultra-luxury ship integrates accessibility thoroughly, competitors must follow. My visibility aboard Prestige's inaugural\u2014a power wheelchair user experiencing the pinnacle of cruise luxury\u2014becomes advocacy simply by being present.\n\nI'll document everything: what works, what needs improvement, what surpasses expectations. My accessibility travel blog has followed Prestige's construction for three years. Fellow disabled travelers are waiting for my inaugural-voyage report before making their own decisions.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige isn't just a cruise for me. It's the future I've been advocating toward\u2014ultra-luxury that genuinely includes travelers whose bodies work differently.\n\nI'm honored to be among the first to experience it. I'm determined to ensure others can follow.\n\nPrestige launches next year. So does the next chapter of accessible luxury travel.\n\n**The lesson:** Accessibility isn't about special treatment\u2014it's about equal dignity.",

But starting with Regent's most ambitious ship feels exactly right for someone who doesn't know what's possible.**\n\nMy resistance to cruising had deep roots. The images that reached me were always the same: floating cities with thousands of passengers, buffet lines stretching endlessly, ports overwhelmed by identical tourists. Cruising seemed like the opposite of travel\u2014logistics disguised as adventure.\n\nThen my travel advisor mentioned Prestige. 'Eight hundred fifty guests,' she said. 'All-suite. All-balcony. All-inclusive. Regent's most ambitious expression of ultra-luxury.' She described what those words actually meant: no crowds, no upcharges, no compromise.\n\nI remained skeptical. 'How is that different from what everyone claims?'\n\n'Regent invented these concepts,' she explained. 'Prestige will be their most comprehensive delivery yet.'\n\nI've spent months researching. The Compass Rose\u2014Regent's main restaurant\u2014reportedly matches specialty dining elsewhere. Prime 7's steakhouse serves USDA Prime beef without supplemental charges. Chartreuse delivers French tasting menus that would cost hundreds ashore. All included. All accessible. All mine to discover.\n\nThe unlimited shore excursions particularly appeal to a first-timer's anxiety. I won't know which ports deserve multiple visits until I experience them. On Prestige, I can book every interesting excursion without calculating value. I can change my mind without penalty. I can discover my preferences without financial consequence.\n\nThe inaugural voyage adds dimension to my choice. Fellow passengers will be experienced cruisers eager to evaluate Regent's newest expression\u2014the perfect teachers for someone learning what luxury cruising can mean. The crew will be establishing their standards\u2014extra attentive, extra motivated, extra committed to proving their ship's excellence.\n\nMy travel advisor understood my situation perfectly. 'First-timers on inaugural voyages get the best of both worlds,' she explained. 'New ship energy. Experienced passenger community. The vessel finding her identity while you find yours as a cruiser.'\n\nThe butler service intrigues me most. I've never experienced dedicated personal attention. The concept feels simultaneously luxurious and uncomfortable\u2014someone anticipating my needs before I articulate them, managing logistics I've always handled myself. Prestige's enhanced butler program promises to teach me what surrender to service actually means.\n\nI've booked a Penthouse Suite on Prestige's inaugural Mediterranean voyage. The deposit required trust in a ship I've never seen. But the research convinced me: Regent's track record, the Prestige Class innovations, the comprehensive all-inclusive model. If I'm going to discover what cruising can be, I might as well discover it on the ship that represents cruising's future.\n\nMy friends remain skeptical. 'What if you hate cruising?' they ask. 'You'll have spent all that money learning you don't like ships.'\n\nBut that's exactly why Prestige makes sense. If I'm going to test whether ultra-luxury cruising suits me, I should test it at its best. A mediocre introduction would teach me nothing about what's possible. Prestige promises to show me the ceiling, not the floor.\n\nI've studied the preliminary renderings. The Observation Lounge overlooking the bow. The Coffee Connection with its unlimited premium espresso. The Pool Grill with its Mediterranean views. The Regent Suite with its private spa. Even if I never book another cruise, I'll have experienced cruising at its most ambitious.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige will launch next year. I'll be aboard her inaugural voyage, a first-time cruiser on the industry's newest expression of ultra-luxury.\n\nIf I'm going to learn what cruising can be, I'm going to learn it right.\n\nPrestige will teach me. I'm ready to be taught.\n\n**The lesson:** The price of true luxury isn't for the inclusions\u2014it's for never thinking about price again.",

      "markdown": "**Thirty-eight years of cruising across forty-one cruise lines taught me to be skeptical of 'newest' and 'biggest' claims. But Seven Seas Prestige represents something different: the culmination of an evolution I've tracked since Regent's earliest days. I've already booked her inaugural voyage.**\n\nMy cruising credentials demand explanation. I sailed Seven Seas Navigator in her early years\u2014the intimate 490-guest experience that established Regent's philosophy. I experienced Mariner's all-suite innovation and Voyager's all-balcony pioneering. I tracked Explorer Class as she refined what Voyager had begun. I understand what Regent means because I've witnessed what they've built.\n\nPrestige represents the next chapter. At 850 guests, she'll be Regent's largest\u2014but still intimate by industry standards. The increased capacity enables facilities impossible on smaller ships while maintaining the space ratios that define ultra-luxury. My veteran calculations confirm the math: more guests, proportionally more space, no compromise on the ratios that matter.\n\nThe 'perfecting perfection' philosophy has guided every Regent launch I've witnessed. Explorer improved on Voyager. Splendor refined Explorer. Grandeur advanced Splendor. Each iteration incorporated lessons from the previous. Prestige will incorporate everything Regent has learned since Navigator\u2014two decades of operational wisdom informing design.\n\nI've studied the preliminary specifications obsessively. The enhanced Compass Rose promises expanded seating with maintained intimacy. The new specialty dining concepts suggest culinary ambition beyond current offerings. The suite configurations reflect accumulated understanding of what travelers actually want from their accommodations.\n\nThe all-inclusive model will persist\u2014Regent invented comprehensive inclusion and won't abandon it for their flagship. Every restaurant. Every beverage. Every shore excursion. Every detail. The preliminary pricing confirms the commitment: higher fare than current ships, but proportionally enhanced value.\n\nMy booking decision factored multiple considerations. Inaugural voyages attract Regent loyalists\u2014the passengers who've tracked the brand's evolution as I have. The community aboard Prestige's first sailings will be experienced travelers who understand what they're evaluating. Fellow veterans will provide perspective my individual assessment might miss.\n\nThe inaugural crew factor also appealed. New ships mean heightened attention\u2014every crew member proving their capabilities, every department establishing their standards. I've experienced inaugural voyages where this energy produced exceptional service. I've also experienced crews struggling with new vessels. Regent's track record suggests the former.\n\nMy Penthouse Suite is booked for Prestige's inaugural Mediterranean voyage. The investment is substantial\u2014new ship premiums plus Regent's premium positioning. But thirty-eight years of comparison have taught me that quality costs what quality costs. Prestige will either validate Regent's trajectory or expose its limits.\n\nI'm betting on validation. The evolution from Navigator through Grandeur has been consistently excellent. Each ship refined rather than retreated. Each innovation enhanced rather than complicated. Prestige represents where that evolution points: Regent's most comprehensive expression of what ultra-luxury can mean.\n\nFellow veterans will understand my calculation. New ships from trusted brands merit inaugural investment. The risk of imperfection is balanced by the opportunity to witness excellence at its newest. Prestige's inauguration will either confirm Regent's leadership or require recalibration.\n\nAfter thirty-eight years, I trust my assessment. Seven Seas Prestige will be worth the investment.\n\nThe veteran cruiser has placed his bet. Prestige will deliver.\n\nI've never been more confident in an inaugural booking.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment.",

      "markdown": "**My sixty-fifth birthday falls during Seven Seas Prestige's inaugural season. The symbolism seems perfect: a milestone birthday celebrated on a milestone ship, both of us beginning new chapters simultaneously.**\n\nSixty-five carries weight I didn't anticipate. Retirement becomes real rather than theoretical. Medicare cards arrive. Life expectancy tables become personally relevant. The birthday feels less like celebration than inventory\u2014what have I built, and what remains?\n\nPrestige represents the future. Regent's most ambitious ship. The culmination of their ultra-luxury evolution. The beginning of a new era for a cruise line I've trusted for decades. My birthday will coincide with her birth\u2014both of us discovering what we'll become.\n\nMy children wanted traditional celebration: party at home, friends gathered, the comfortable rituals of milestone birthdays past. But sixty-five deserves something different. Not repetition of what I've always done\u2014exploration of what I've never tried.\n\nThe inaugural voyage particularly appeals. Fellow passengers will be experienced cruisers evaluating Regent's newest expression\u2014the kind of travelers who understand quality and appreciate excellence. The community will be self-selected for compatible values. My birthday celebration will have witnesses who share my standards.\n\nThe all-inclusive model suits milestone celebration perfectly. My children can contribute without negotiating costs. My grandchildren can join without calculating affordability. The comprehensiveness eliminates financial tension that complicated past family gatherings. Everyone simply experiences. Nobody calculates.\n\nI've coordinated with my travel advisor extensively. The Concierge Suite I've booked accommodates my preferences without excess. The itinerary includes ports I've dreamed about for decades. The timing places my actual birthday at sea\u2014the ultimate neutral territory for gathering family.\n\nThe preliminary Prestige renderings show the venues where I'll celebrate. The Compass Rose where my birthday dinner will unfold. The Chartreuse where tasting menus will honor my decades of loving French cuisine. The Prime 7 where steaks will fuel family conversation. The Pool Grill where casual moments will punctuate formal ones.\n\nThe Observation Lounge calls to me particularly. Coffee Connection's baristas will learn my preferences\u2014cortado, extra shot, served overlooking wherever Prestige is sailing. Morning rituals deserve beautiful settings. Sixty-five mornings deserve Prestige's most beautiful views.\n\nMy children have coordinated secretly. I know this because they've asked subtle questions about my Regent history\u2014which ships I've sailed, which crew members I've remembered, which moments have mattered. They're planning surprises I'm not supposed to anticipate. I anticipate them anyway.\n\nThe emotional weight surprises me. Sixty-five feels like permission\u2014to slow down, to prioritize beauty, to accept that accomplishment no longer requires accumulation. Prestige embodies that permission: luxury that serves rather than impresses, excellence that comforts rather than competes.\n\nMy birthday will arrive aboard a ship finding her identity. I'll celebrate alongside fellow passengers learning what Prestige can deliver. The crew will be establishing their excellence. The vessel will be discovering her rhythms. We'll all be becoming whatever we're meant to become.\n\nSeven Seas Prestige represents Regent's future. My sixty-fifth birthday represents my future's beginning. The coincidence feels meaningful rather than accidental.\n\nThe milestone ship for a milestone birthday. New chapters beginning together.\n\nI'm ready to turn sixty-five. Prestige is ready to show me what sixty-five can mean.\n\n**The lesson:** Milestone moments deserve milestone settings.",

      "markdown": "**Two years ago, I nearly died from COVID-19. Forty-three days on a ventilator. Months of rehabilitation. The long-haul symptoms that persist even now. When Seven Seas Prestige was announced, I knew immediately: my continued recovery would happen aboard Regent's newest ship.**\n\nThe illness transformed my relationship with travel. Before COVID, I cruised for pleasure\u2014a leisure activity among many. After COVID, travel became recovery\u2014proof that I could still exist beyond hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Each voyage demonstrated survival. Each destination confirmed capability.\n\nMy recovery cruises since discharge have followed Regent ships: Explorer for my first post-COVID voyage, Splendor for my second, Grandeur for my third. Each ship carried me further from the ventilator. Each voyage rebuilt confidence the virus had destroyed. Regent's comprehensive care made recovery possible.\n\nPrestige represents the next chapter. Regent's most ambitious ship. Enhanced medical facilities. Expanded wellness programming. The crew training specifically for guests with complex needs. The preliminary specifications suggest a ship designed for travelers like me\u2014people who need luxury and care simultaneously.\n\nThe all-inclusive model particularly matters for recovery travel. Long-haul COVID manifests unpredictably\u2014some days strong, some days depleted, energy fluctuating without warning. The comprehensive inclusion means I can adjust plans without financial consequence. Book three excursions, complete one if fatigue overwhelms. Order elaborate dinners, eat half if appetite fails. The flexibility accommodates bodies that can't predict themselves.\n\nMy travel advisor understands my situation completely. She's coordinated with Regent's medical team since my first post-COVID voyage. They know my symptoms, my limitations, my triggers. Prestige will continue that coordination\u2014enhanced by the new ship's expanded capabilities.\n\nThe inaugural voyage factor appeals specifically. New ships mean heightened attention\u2014crews proving their excellence, departments establishing their standards. For a recovery traveler, this heightened attention translates to enhanced care. Everyone will be watching. Everyone will be trying harder. My needs will be noticed more quickly.\n\nI've booked a Penthouse Suite on Prestige's inaugural Mediterranean voyage. The investment is significant\u2014recovery travel costs what recovery travel costs. But the alternative is remaining home, avoiding the world, surrendering to the limitations the virus imposed. Prestige represents refusal to surrender.\n\nThe preliminary renderings show the spa where I'll continue physical recovery. The wellness programming designed for guests rebuilding capabilities. The pool deck where gentle exercise will strengthen what the ventilator weakened. The Observation Lounge where morning meditation will calm the anxiety long-haul COVID brought.\n\nThe Compass Rose calls to me particularly. Fine dining was impossible for months after discharge\u2014swallowing difficulties, taste alterations, the hundred ways COVID damaged my body. Each Regent voyage has rebuilt my relationship with food. Prestige will continue that rebuilding\u2014new ship, new menus, new opportunities to rediscover pleasure in eating.\n\nMy doctors support this voyage. 'Recovery requires more than medicine,' my pulmonologist observed. 'Beauty helps. Luxury helps. Proof that you can still access the world you nearly left\u2014that helps most of all.'\n\nSeven Seas Prestige will launch next year. My recovery will board her inaugural voyage. The newest ship for a traveler still learning what her body can do.\n\nTwo years since the ventilator. Prestige represents how far I've come.\n\nThe recovery continues. The ship of the future will carry me forward.\n\nI survived. Now I'm learning to live again. Prestige will help me remember how.\n\n**The lesson:** Medicine can cure disease, but healing requires beauty, care, and permission to want things again.",
