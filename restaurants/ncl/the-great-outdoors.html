      <h3>The Great Outdoors Review: Buffet Food, Better Setting</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Great Outdoors is the outdoor extension of Garden Cafe — the alfresco buffet dining area found on most Norwegian ships. It serves the same food as the indoor buffet but in an open-air setting with ocean views. Complimentary and included in the cruise fare. It operates during breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner depending on weather.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The food is identical to Garden Cafe — same omelet station at breakfast (still the best free breakfast item), same carving station at lunch, same rotating international stations. The quality is the same because it is the same food, just carried outside. The difference is the experience of eating it. Where it falls short: the outdoor serving stations sometimes don't carry the full Garden Cafe selection — popular items run out faster because restocking is slower. Hot food cools faster in the open air, especially on windy days. The salad and cold stations hold up better outdoors. On port days in hot climates, the sun can make outdoor dining uncomfortable by midday.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>It's self-serve from the outdoor stations, with staff handling drinks and clearing plates. The table areas are served by waitstaff who are attentive with beverages. The outdoor setting means slightly less frenzied energy than the indoor buffet — people who come outside generally want a more relaxed pace. Plate clearing is prompt.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>This is where The Great Outdoors earns its name — ocean air, open sky, and sea views while you eat breakfast or lunch. On calm Caribbean mornings, there's nothing better than an omelet with a view of the horizon. The seating is a mix of tables and lounger-style chairs. Wind can be a factor — napkins and light items need anchoring. On Alaska and Northern European itineraries, the outdoor area may be too cold for comfortable dining. When the weather cooperates, it's the best dining setting on the ship.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5.</strong> The Great Outdoors offers the same buffet food as Garden Cafe with the significant upgrade of fresh air and ocean views. It loses points for reduced selection, food cooling quickly, and weather dependence. <em>Tip:</em> Eat breakfast here on Caribbean sea days — an omelet, bacon, coffee, and an ocean view at 7:30 a.m. is one of the best free experiences on the cruise. Check the wind before committing to a table.</p>
