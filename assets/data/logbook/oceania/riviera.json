      "markdown": "**Riviera launched in 2012 as [Marina](/ships/oceania/marina.html)'s sister—sharing the class design with refinements from Marina's inaugural experience.**\n\nThe specifications match: 1,250 guests, same dining venues, same public spaces. The Marina Class represented Oceania's growth from R Class intimacy to larger-ship capability.\n\nSecond ships often improve on first ships' lessons. Riviera incorporated operational feedback from Marina's debut. The refinements are subtle but compound across a voyage.\n\nTogether, Marina and Riviera carried Oceania through a decade of growth before Allura Class arrival. These ships proved the brand could scale without sacrificing identity.\n\nFor Marina Class choice: both ships deliver identical fundamental experience. Choose based on itinerary rather than expecting meaningful ship-to-ship differences. Where you want to sail matters more than which sister you board.",

      "markdown": "**Riviera's Artist's Loft provides creative programming that reveals Oceania's understanding of what their guests actually want.**\n\nThe Artist's Loft offers genuine instruction in various media. Painting, drawing, ceramics—real techniques taught by practicing artists. The classes produce actual work you take home.\n\nThe programming assumes guests are intelligent adults with interests beyond consumption. The enrichment philosophy extends beyond arts: guest lecturers, destination experts, culturally relevant programming.\n\nOceania attracts guests who've done mainstream cruising and want more. The demographics skew toward professionals, academics, curious minds. The enrichment responds to that audience.\n\nRiviera's approach contrasts with entertainment-focused competitors. Less production show spectacle, more substance. Less activity for activity's sake, more meaningful engagement.\n\nFor enrichment priorities: Riviera offers intellectual and creative engagement rare in cruising. The programming treats guests as people with interests, not audiences to fill seats.",

      "markdown": "**Riviera's Mediterranean deployments showcase why Oceania serves this region better than mega-ship alternatives.**\n\nThe 1,250-guest capacity fits Mediterranean ports comfortably. Historic harbors that mega-ships overwhelm welcome Riviera naturally. Santorini, Amalfi, Dubrovnik—the ship-to-port ratio works.\n\nOceania's destination-intensive philosophy shines in the Mediterranean. More ports, longer stays, fewer sea days. The itineraries assume you came to experience the region, not just see it from a distance.\n\nCulinary quality matches Mediterranean standards. When you're visiting regions defined by food culture, the ship's cuisine needs to compete. Toscana's Italian, the Grand Dining Room's Mediterranean emphasis—Riviera holds its own.\n\nThe passenger demographic on Mediterranean sailings tends experienced and cultured. Fellow travelers understand the region. Conversations enrich port experiences.\n\nFor Mediterranean priorities: Riviera offers the right scale, the right itineraries, and the right atmosphere for this region. Oceania understands Mediterranean cruising.",
