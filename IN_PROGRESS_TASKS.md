2. If the task or related files are listed here, **DO NOT START** - wait or work on something else
3. If clear, add your task below with thread ID and timestamp

### While Working:
1. Keep your entry updated with progress notes
2. If you encounter blockers, note them here

### When Complete:
1. Remove your entry from this file
2. Add the task to COMPLETED_TASKS.md (if user confirms completion)
3. Or move back to UNFINISHED_TASKS.md (if incomplete/blocked)

**IMPORTANT RULES:**

1. **One thread per task area** - Don't work on the same files as another thread
2. **Update this file first** - Before starting any significant work
3. **Clean up after yourself** - Remove your entry when done
4. **Be specific about files** - List exact files you're modifying to prevent conflicts
5. **Check timestamps** - If an entry is >24 hours old with no updates, it may be stale
