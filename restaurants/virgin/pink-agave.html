      <h3>Pink Agave Review: Elevated Mexican That Earns Its Hype</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Pink Agave is Virgin Voyages' elevated Mexican restaurant — and it's consistently ranked among the best dining experiences at sea by guests and cruise reviewers alike. Designed by Tom Dixon with a modern, agave-inspired aesthetic, the room is as stunning as the food. This isn't Tex-Mex or taco-bar casual; it's refined Mexican cuisine with the largest mezcal and tequila collection at sea. Included in the fare (no cover charge), it books up fast for good reason.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The guacamole, made tableside with your choice of additions, is the essential opener — creamy, bright with lime, and customizable with mango, pomegranate, or crispy grasshoppers (chapulines) for the adventurous. The short rib barbacoa is meltingly tender with a depth of flavor that suggests hours of slow cooking. The mole negro with chicken is complex and earthy — layers of chili, chocolate, and spice. For lighter appetites, the ceviche and corn esquites are fresh and vibrant. The mezcal and tequila menu is genuinely impressive — flights are available and the bartenders know their agave spirits. Honest note: the sharing-plate format means portions for individual items are moderate. If you're very hungry, order broadly. A few dishes — particularly the fish tacos — don't quite match the sophistication of the stronger items. The dessert menu (churros with chocolate sauce, tres leches) is good but feels like an afterthought compared to the savory courses.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The staff at Pink Agave are among the most knowledgeable on the ship — they can walk you through the mezcal list, explain the mole preparation, and guide sharing-plate ordering for your group size. The tableside guacamole is a nice interactive touch. Pacing is relaxed and suited to the sharing format. Reservations are essential — this is the second-hardest booking on the ship after The Test Kitchen.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Tom Dixon's design is gorgeous — pink and copper tones, agave-inspired sculptural elements, warm lighting, and a sophistication that matches the cuisine. This is one of the most beautiful restaurants on any cruise ship. The room is intimate and the tables are well-spaced, making it a strong date-night choice. The noise level is moderate — lively but controlled. The bar area is a destination in its own right for mezcal and tequila flights.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.4/5.</strong> Pink Agave is one of Virgin Voyages' finest restaurants — the guacamole, barbacoa, and mole are genuine highlights, and the room is stunning. It falls just short of perfect because a few dishes don't match the kitchen's best work and the desserts feel underdeveloped. But this is Mexican cuisine taken seriously at sea, and the no-cover-charge inclusion makes it an extraordinary value. <em>Tip:</em> book on Day 1, order the tableside guacamole with chapulines, and try a mezcal flight — that's the full Pink Agave experience.</p>
