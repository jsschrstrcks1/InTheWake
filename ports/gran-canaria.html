          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped onto the pier at Las Palmas into air that smelled of salt and warm stone and something faintly floral—bougainvillea, I would learn, which spills over every wall on this island. The morning was brilliant, the sky an impossible blue that northern Europeans dream about through their gray winters. Gran Canaria sat before me like a promise: Spain's territory, but Africa's latitude, blessed with eternal spring while the rest of the continent shivers or sweats. The Canary Islands have beckoned travelers for centuries, and standing there watching the light play across the harbor, I understood why.</p>

            <p>They call Gran Canaria a "miniature continent," and I discovered the truth of this within hours. From the port I could see the city climbing upward into distant mountains, the landscape shifting from urban to volcanic to forested before vanishing into clouds that clung to the peaks like cotton. Drive forty-five minutes in any direction and you enter a completely different world—Saharan dunes in the south, misty pine forests in the center where ancient dragon trees guard forgotten paths, rocky badlands in the west that could pass for Arizona, lush ravines bursting with tropical palms and cascading bougainvillea. All of this packed onto an island barely thirty miles across, a geological sampler platter that takes your breath away with each turn in the road.</p>

            <p>The Maspalomas Dunes were my pilgrimage, a journey south that felt like traveling between planets. The bus wound through resort towns and terraced banana plantations heavy with ripening fruit until suddenly the landscape opened into something completely otherworldly: golden dunes rolling toward the sea like frozen waves, their crests sharp against the brilliant blue sky. I walked into the dunes as afternoon light began to warm the sand from gold to amber. The wind sculpted new shapes while I watched, erasing footprints, creating ripples that looked like the surface of an alien ocean. However, it was the silence that caught me—broken only by wind and distant surf, a hush that felt almost sacred. Tears pricked my eyes at the strange beauty of it, this desert meeting this sea, this impossible landscape that Europe forgot to include anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Back in Las Palmas, I wandered Vegueta's colonial streets where Christopher Columbus walked in 1492, stopping for ship repairs before discovering the Americas. Casa de Colón stands where his lodgings stood, a beautiful museum now but still carrying echoes of that moment when the world was about to change forever. The interior courtyards with their carved wooden balconies transported me across centuries. Cobblestones worn smooth by five centuries of footsteps led me past more wooden balconies adorned with geraniums and through Plaza Santa Ana, where the cathedral's towers caught the late sun and cast long shadows across the square. Pigeons gathered near an ancient fountain while elderly men played chess on stone benches. The smell of papas arrugadas—wrinkled potatoes with mojo sauce—drifted from a nearby restaurant, impossibly savory and inviting, pulling me toward dinner like a compass pointing north.</p>

            <p>Yet it was dinner at Mercado de Vegueta that truly anchored my heart to this place. Upstairs in the old market hall, tapas bars serve the island's best simple food. I ate papas arrugadas with both green and red mojo, tasting the herbs and peppers of Canarian tradition. Fresh fish that had been swimming that morning arrived grilled with nothing but salt and lemon. Local cheese called queso de flor, made with thistle flower rennet, was creamy and slightly tangy, unlike anything I'd tasted before. The wine was local too—volcanic terroir creating something surprisingly refined. Around me, families gathered for their evening meal, children running between tables while grandparents supervised with benevolent patience. I felt like a guest at someone's home, welcomed into a tradition older than my country.</p>

            <p>My heart swelled with gratitude as I walked back toward the ship through streets softened by evening light. The air had cooled to perfect comfort, carrying the sound of conversation and laughter from apartment balconies above. Gran Canaria had given me deserts and cathedrals, colonial history and volcanic wonder, all wrapped in weather so perfect it felt like a blessing. I thought about how many travelers had passed through these waters over the millennia—Phoenicians seeking trade, Romans hunting murex snails for their purple dye, Spanish conquistadors provisioning for New World adventures, modern cruise passengers like myself—each of us drawn by the same mysterious pull toward these fortunate islands at the edge of the known world. I felt blessed and privileged to have discovered what lies beyond the tourist brochures: an island that contains multitudes, a miniature continent floating in the Atlantic, patient and generous with all who take the time to explore its wonders.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at Muelle Santa Catalina in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria's largest city and the Canary Islands' commercial capital. The modern terminal sits near Parque Santa Catalina, a lively square with cafés and tourist information. From here, the waterfront promenade stretches invitingly toward the city.</p>

            <p>The port enjoys an exceptionally convenient location. Walk ten minutes and you reach Las Canteras—a three-kilometer curve of golden sand protected by a natural reef, consistently ranked among Europe's finest urban shorelines. The historic Vegueta quarter lies further south, about twenty minutes by bus #1 (€1.50) or taxi (€10). Most major attractions in Las Palmas are accessible without expensive excursions.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to high depending on activities.</strong> Staying near the port for waterfront strolling and swimming requires minimal effort. Exploring Vegueta's cobbled streets involves moderate walking. The Maspalomas Dunes are a separate excursion (45-60 minutes by bus) that requires walking on soft sand—rewarding but more demanding. Wheelchair users will find the port area and Las Canteras promenade accessible; historic Vegueta has cobblestones and stairs. Budget 6-8 hours for a satisfying exploration of either the city or the southern dunes.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> Las Canteras shoreline is 10 minutes from the terminal. The promenade runs three kilometers—flat, accessible, and beautiful. Port to Parque Santa Catalina: 5 minutes. Walking to Vegueta (30+ minutes, hilly) is possible but buses are easier.</p>

            <p><strong>Buses (Guaguas):</strong> Excellent public transit throughout Las Palmas and the island. Bus #1 runs from near the port to Vegueta (€1.50, 15 minutes). Bus #30 goes to Maspalomas Dunes (€4.30, 45-60 minutes)—far cheaper than taxis and runs frequently. Buy tickets from drivers or get a rechargeable card for slight discount.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Metered, reasonably priced. White with green stripe. Port to Vegueta: approximately €10. Port to Maspalomas: €40-50 one way. Useful for Vegueta, not economical for Maspalomas unless sharing with a group.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer Maspalomas, island tours, and Vegueta packages ($80-200). Going <strong>independent</strong> saves significant money, especially to Maspalomas (bus versus taxi). For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, note that bus #30 runs frequently—just watch the schedule. <strong>Book ahead</strong> only needed for specific restaurants or tours.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The port area and Las Canteras promenade are fully accessible with smooth surfaces. Vegueta's historic center has cobblestones and uneven terrain—manageable but challenging for wheelchairs. Buses have low floors and accessibility features. Maspalomas Dunes are not wheelchair accessible—the sand requires walking.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Gran Canaria rewards <strong>independent</strong> exploration—public transport is excellent and attractions are accessible. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> make sense for comprehensive island tours or if you prefer organized logistics. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for specific restaurants or guided activities.</p>

            <h3>Maspalomas Dunes Natural Reserve</h3>
            <p>Gran Canaria's crown jewel: golden sand dunes stretching to the sea, unique in Europe. The protected reserve covers 400 hectares of shifting sand, creating landscapes that look transported from the Sahara. Take bus #30 from Las Palmas (€4.30, 45-60 minutes). Free access. Wear comfortable shoes for walking on sand, bring water, and go early morning or late afternoon for best light and cooler temperatures. Allow 2-3 hours at the dunes plus travel time. Absolutely unmissable—this is why people visit Gran Canaria.</p>

            <h3>Vegueta Historic Quarter</h3>
            <p>The colonial heart of Las Palmas, founded in 1478. Cobbled streets wind past Canarian architecture with distinctive wooden balconies. Visit the Cathedral of Santa Ana (exterior free, interior €1.50), climb the tower for views (€5 total). Explore Plaza Santa Ana and the surrounding streets where Columbus walked. Casa de Colón museum (€4) occupies the building where Columbus stayed in 1492. The quarter feels like stepping back five centuries. Bus #1 from port (€1.50). Allow 2-3 hours. Morning best to avoid siesta closures (1-4pm).</p>

            <h3>Mercado de Vegueta</h3>
            <p>Historic covered market from 1854 in the heart of Vegueta. Fresh produce, local cheeses, and tropical fruits downstairs; excellent tapas bars upstairs. This is where locals eat—authentic, affordable, and delicious. Try papas arrugadas with mojo sauce (€4-6), fresh grilled fish (€8-12), and queso de flor cheese. Open mornings and evenings; closed Sunday. Allow 1-2 hours including meal. Free entry; budget €15-25 for a substantial lunch.</p>

            <h3>Las Canteras Waterfront</h3>
            <p>One of Europe's finest urban shorelines—three kilometers of golden sand protected by La Barra natural reef. Walk from the port in 10 minutes. Calm swimming in the center section, surfing at the southern end. Beach bars and restaurants line the promenade. Free access. Rent sunbeds and umbrellas (€8-12) or bring your own towel. Excellent facilities including showers and changing rooms. Allow half-day for relaxed waterfront time.</p>

            <h3>Caldera de Bandama</h3>
            <p>Volcanic crater 574 meters in diameter and 200 meters deep—a dramatic reminder of Gran Canaria's volcanic origins. Panoramic viewpoints at the rim offer spectacular views of the crater and surrounding landscape. Optional hiking trail descends to the crater floor (steep, 30-45 minutes down, longer up). Located 20 minutes from Las Palmas by taxi (€20-25 each way). Free access. Wear hiking shoes if descending. Half-day excursion with travel.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (€). Credit/debit cards widely accepted throughout Las Palmas and tourist areas. ATMs abundant. Cash useful for small purchases and market vendors.</p>

            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Spanish, but English widely spoken in tourist areas. Basic Spanish appreciated—"gracias" (thanks) and "por favor" (please) go a long way. Menus typically available in English.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Gran Canaria enjoys "eternal spring"—temperatures 20-26°C (68-79°F) year-round. Northern Las Palmas can be cloudier than the sunny south. Microclimates mean you might experience sun and clouds on the same day. Pack layers and sunscreen regardless of season.</p>

            <p><strong>Food & Drink:</strong> Papas arrugadas (wrinkled potatoes with mojo sauce) are quintessentially Canarian—€4-8 everywhere. Fresh fish grilled simply is excellent (€12-20). Queso de flor from Guía is unique artisan cheese (€5-8 for a tasting). Gofio (toasted grain flour) appears in traditional dishes. Ron miel (honey rum) makes a popular souvenir. Canary Island bananas are smaller and sweeter than Caribbean varieties—try them fresh from markets.</p>

            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> Not obligatory in Spain but appreciated. Round up at cafés, 5-10% at restaurants for good service. Tipping taxi drivers not expected.</p>

            <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Canarian handicrafts include basketwork and embroidery. Ron miel and local wines make excellent souvenirs. Gofio and mojo sauces travel well. Duty-free status means electronics and perfumes are competitively priced.</p>

        <details class="port-section faq" open>
          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>Q: Are the Maspalomas Dunes worth visiting from a cruise ship?</strong><br />
            A: Absolutely. The Maspalomas Dunes are Gran Canaria's crown jewel—golden sand dunes stretching to the sea, unique in Europe. Take bus #30 from Las Palmas (€4.30, 45-60 minutes each way). The otherworldly landscape rewards the journey. Allow half a day minimum.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I get from the cruise port to the city center?</strong><br />
            A: Ships dock at Muelle Santa Catalina. Las Canteras waterfront is 10 minutes' walk. Vegueta historic quarter is 20 minutes by bus #1 (€1.50) or taxi (€10). The port location is very convenient.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Should I visit Maspalomas or stay in Las Palmas?</strong><br />
            A: Both have appeal. Maspalomas offers unique natural beauty—otherworldly dunes unlike anything else in Europe. Las Palmas offers colonial history, excellent food, and a superb shoreline walkable from the ship. With a full day, you could combine a morning in Maspalomas with late afternoon in Vegueta, but you'd be rushing. Choose based on your priorities.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the best thing to eat?</strong><br />
            A: Start with papas arrugadas (wrinkled potatoes) with mojo sauce—both green (cilantro) and red (pepper) versions. Fresh fish grilled simply is excellent. Visit Mercado de Vegueta for authentic tapas at local prices. Queso de flor cheese is unique to Gran Canaria and worth seeking out.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Gran Canaria safe?</strong><br />
            A: Yes, very safe. Las Palmas is a modern Spanish city with normal urban precautions—watch belongings in crowded areas. Tourist areas are particularly secure. Violent crime is rare.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like?</strong><br />
            A: Gran Canaria enjoys "eternal spring"—pleasant temperatures year-round (20-26°C / 68-79°F). Southern areas (Maspalomas) are sunnier than northern Las Palmas. Microclimates mean conditions can vary across the island. Pack sunscreen and a light layer.</p>
