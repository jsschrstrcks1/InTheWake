    <h2>Majesty of the Seas</h2>
    <p class="tiny">Royal Caribbean — Sovereign-class • Historical Ship</p>
    <h3>Brief History</h3>
    <p>Launched in 1992 as the final Sovereign‑class ship, Majesty of the Seas sailed short Bahamas and Caribbean itineraries from Florida for decades. A popular choice for first‑time cruisers, she was known for her lively pool deck, Viking Crown Lounge views, and efficient layout. After her 2016 refresh she carried updated dining and family areas. In 2021 she left the Royal Caribbean fleet; after a lay‑up period she was acquired by Seajets as Majesty, later renamed Majesty of the Oceans. Public operations remain limited as the ship awaits future deployment. (Historical listing.)</p>
