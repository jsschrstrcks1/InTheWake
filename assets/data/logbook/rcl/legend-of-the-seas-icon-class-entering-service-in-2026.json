Legend of the Seas will carry these advances with a name that connects to RCL heritage.\n\nThe combination honors history while embracing innovation. Passengers who sailed the original Legend may cruise the new version, experiencing how far the industry has evolved.\n\nFor fleet context: The new Legend of the Seas proves that names can outlive individual ships. The legacy continues on an entirely new platform.",

Icon-class deployment typically emphasizes popular markets where the ships' scale provides competitive advantage.\n\nBooking strategy for new ships: inaugural voyages attract premium pricing and high demand. Later sailings offer operational maturity. Choose based on whether you prioritize being first or prefer proven operations.\n\nFor booking consideration: Legend of the Seas will offer newest RCL experience with a name that carries positive heritage. Watch for booking announcements.\n\n**The lesson:** First voyages teach what no brochure can\u2014that cruising is less about the ship and more about who you become aboard her.",
