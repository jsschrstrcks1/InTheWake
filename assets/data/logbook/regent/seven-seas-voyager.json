      "markdown": "**Seven Seas Voyager launched in 2003 as the world's first all-suite, all-balcony cruise ship—establishing the standard Regent would build its identity upon.**\n\nBefore Voyager, even luxury cruise lines mixed balcony and inside cabins. Voyager proved that all-balcony was achievable, desirable, and definitive of ultra-luxury positioning.\n\n[Seven Seas Mariner](/ships/regent/seven-seas-mariner.html) preceded Voyager with all-suite design but included some balcony-less accommodations. Voyager completed the vision—every suite includes private outdoor space.\n\nThe commitment influenced the entire industry. Competitors followed with their own all-balcony ships. What Voyager pioneered became luxury standard.\n\nFor fleet heritage: Voyager represents historical inflection point—the ship that proved what ultra-luxury could mean. Explorer Class ships refine what Voyager originated.",

      "markdown": "**Seven Seas Voyager carries 700 guests—smaller than Explorer Class's 750 but larger than Navigator's 490. For some travelers, this scale matters.**\n\nThe intimate capacity creates community naturally. You recognize fellow passengers. Crew know your preferences. The ship feels like traveling club rather than floating resort.\n\nFewer amenities than Explorer Class ships—the Voyager Class design predates the newest generation's expanded venues. But the trade-off brings intimacy that larger ships sacrifice.\n\nVoyager serves itineraries where her size advantages matter—ports that accommodate 700 guests more comfortably than 750, regions where intimate scale enhances destination access.\n\nFor scale priorities: Seven Seas Voyager delivers Regent quality at more intimate capacity. Whether you value this depends on your preference for community versus facilities.",

      "markdown": "**Seven Seas Voyager has sailed since 2003—but continuous refurbishment keeps her contemporary rather than dated.**\n\nRegent invests in Voyager Class updates deliberately. The ships pioneered concepts the brand still values. Rather than letting them decline, Regent maintains them as showcase of what intimate Regent cruising offers.\n\nRecent refurbishments updated suites, public spaces, and dining venues. Materials, furnishings, and technology reflect current standards rather than 2003 vintage.\n\nThe ship feels classic rather than old. Design choices honor her heritage while updating functionality. The atmosphere reads as established excellence rather than aging infrastructure.\n\nFor condition assessment: Seven Seas Voyager demonstrates commitment to fleet-wide quality. The refurbishment investment signals intent to maintain these vessels for guests who prefer intimate scale.",
