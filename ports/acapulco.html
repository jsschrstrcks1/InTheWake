        <h1>Acapulco: Where Courage Dives Into Legend</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Acapulco was once the crown jewel of Mexico's Pacific coast — where Hollywood stars vacationed in the 1950s, where Elvis filmed <em>Fun in Acapulco</em>, where the golden age of Mexican tourism began. The city has weathered challenges over the decades, including Hurricane Otis in October 2023, which devastated much of the infrastructure. But the spirit of Acapulco — resilient, warm, and proud — endures. The cliff divers still dive. The bay still gleams. Recovery continues, and cruise ships have returned to support the city's revival.</p>

          <p>La Quebrada is what you came for, whether you realize it or not. Since 1934, professional divers have climbed barefoot up jagged rocks to a platform 135 feet above a narrow ocean cove (roughly the height of a 13-story building, or about 41 meters of pure courage, or precisely enough altitude to question every life decision that led to this moment). They wait for the incoming wave to surge water deep enough into the rocky channel. Then they dive — arms outstretched like crucifixes — plunging through the air into the churning Pacific. Timing is everything. Too early and they hit rocks. Too late and the wave recedes, leaving shallow water. They've been doing this for 90 years (approximately 32,850 days of gravity-defying tradition, or roughly the time it takes to become really, really good at falling gracefully). Every single dive is a held breath.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Watching a young diver — maybe 20 years old — climb to the highest platform as the sun set behind him. He kissed a small shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, crossed himself, and dove. The crowd gasped as one. He surfaced, raised a fist in triumph, and the cliff-side restaurant erupted in applause. That's Acapulco — courage passed down through generations, beauty earned through risk.
          </div>

          <p>Fort San Diego sits above the port, a perfectly preserved star-shaped Spanish fortress from 1616 that once guarded the Manila Galleon trade route. Inside, a museum tells the story of the Nao de China — Spanish ships that sailed from Acapulco to the Philippines and back, carrying silk, porcelain, and spices that shaped the colonial economy. The views from the ramparts sweep across Acapulco Bay. It's a quieter experience than the cliff divers, but no less important to understanding this city's place in history.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Terminal Marítima downtown — 15-minute walk to Zócalo (main plaza) (roughly the time it takes to listen to three pop songs, or about 900 seconds of tropical strolling, or just enough time to dodge seventeen street vendors selling silver jewelry)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> 15 min walk (approximately the time needed to realize you forgot to bring pesos, or about the length of two vendor negotiations, or roughly enough time to photograph the same palm tree from twelve different angles); taxis plentiful at port</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Mexican Peso (MXN); US Dollars accepted at many tourist spots; ATMs available; credit cards widely accepted</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Spanish; some English at tourist areas</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; organized tours recommended over independent driving</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Status:</strong> Hurricane Otis (Oct 2023) caused significant damage; recovery ongoing; check ship updates for current conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> November–April (dry season); May–October hot and humid with occasional rain</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">La Quebrada Cliff Divers</h4>
          <p>The iconic 135-foot cliff dives into narrow ocean cove (about the height of falling from the 13th floor while everyone watches, or roughly 41 meters of "nope," or precisely enough distance to recite the Lord's Prayer twice before impact). Shows daily at 1pm and evenings (7pm, 8pm, 9pm). Watch from public viewing area (small fee) or La Perla restaurant/bar (drinks required). Thrilling and unforgettable. Acapulco's signature experience since 1934. Don't miss this.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fort San Diego (Fuerte de San Diego)</h4>
          <p>1616 Spanish star-shaped fortress, now museum of Manila Galleon trade history. Excellent preservation, stunning bay views from ramparts. 10-min walk from port (roughly the time it takes to apply sunscreen to every exposed surface while walking uphill, or about 600 seconds of historical anticipation, or just enough time to wish you'd brought water). ~$5 entry (approximately the cost of one overpriced bottled water at the cruise port, or roughly 90 pesos of air-conditioned bliss). Allow 1-2 hours (about the time it takes to pretend you're a Spanish conquistador while secretly just enjoying the AC, or roughly 60-120 minutes of colonial history appreciation). Air-conditioned escape from heat with fascinating history.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Isla la Roqueta</h4>
          <p>Island nature reserve across from downtown. Glass-bottom boats from Playa Caleta. Snorkeling, swimming, beach restaurants, Virgen de los Mares underwater statue. 10-min boat ride (roughly the time it takes to realize you get seasick on small boats, or about 600 seconds of Pacific wave-hopping, or just enough time to spot seventeen fish through the glass bottom and pretend you know what species they are). ~$5-10 round-trip (approximately the cost of two tacos al pastor, or roughly 90-180 pesos of island adventure, or about the price of aquatic escapism). Allow 2-3 hours (about the time it takes to snorkel, eat, nap, and question why you don't live on an island, or roughly 120-180 minutes of tropical paradise). Family-friendly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Chapel of Peace (Capilla de la Paz)</h4>
          <p>Hilltop chapel with panoramic 360-degree views over Acapulco Bay. Accessible via taxi or tour. Non-denominational, open to all. Stunning photo opportunity. ~15-min drive from port (roughly the time it takes to have an entire conversation with your taxi driver using hand gestures and three Spanish words, or about 900 seconds of switchback road climbing, or just enough time to wonder if your driver knows where he's actually going). Check current accessibility post-hurricane.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Malecón Boardwalk</h4>
          <p>Scenic waterfront promenade along Acapulco Bay. Restaurants, vendors, street performers. Walk from port toward Zócalo. Good for people-watching and getting a feel for local life. Free and accessible.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Cathedral of Our Lady of Solitude</h4>
          <p>1930s cathedral on the Zócalo (main plaza). Blue Byzantine-inspired domes. Cool interior, beautiful architecture. 15-min walk from port (approximately the time it takes to remember you should have worn different shoes, or about 900 seconds of tropical sidewalk navigation, or roughly enough time to pass the same street vendor selling mangoes three times because you got slightly lost). Free entry. Combine with downtown exploration.</p>

            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Inexpensive but challenging for cruise visitors; routes complex</li>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>

            <li>Cliff diver shows at 1pm less crowded than evening performances</li>
            <li>Bring small bills (pesos or USD) for tipping divers — it's traditional and appreciated</li>
            <li>Fort San Diego air-conditioned and excellent midday escape from heat</li>
            <li>Drink bottled water only; avoid ice in drinks outside established restaurants</li>

            <li>Keep valuables locked on ship; bring only what you need for the day</li>
            <li>Sunscreen and hat essential — Pacific sun intense</li>
            <li>Evening cliff diving performances more dramatic with flaming torches at night shows</li>
          </ul>
