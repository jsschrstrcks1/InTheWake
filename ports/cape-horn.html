              <p>
                We woke to the captain's announcement: "Ladies and gentlemen,
                we have a window." Around Cape Horn, those words are rarer
                than calm seas—the convergence of Pacific and Atlantic creates
                weather that kills sailors and sinks ships. The Drake Passage
                had tossed us for two days. Now, inexplicably, the ocean lay
                flat as a lake, and we were going ashore.

                Climbing the wooden stairs from the beach to the memorial,
                the wind—always the wind—tried to push me back. At the top,
                the albatross sculpture cut a bird-shaped hole in the gray
                sky, a memorial to the ten thousand sailors who died rounding
                the Horn before the Panama Canal made it optional. The Chilean
                navy lighthouse keeper emerged to stamp our passports. We were
                at 55°58' South—beyond this, only Antarctica. The end of
                everything or the beginning, depending on your direction.

            <h2>About Cape Horn</h2>
            <p>
              Cape Horn (Cabo de Hornos) is the southernmost headland of the
              Tierra del Fuego archipelago in Chile. The steep cliff on Hornos
              Island marks where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans meet—a point
              of profound maritime significance for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the Panama Canal (1914), every ship traveling between
              Atlantic and Pacific had to round the Horn. The treacherous
              passage claimed an estimated 10,000+ sailors' lives and 800+
              ships. Today, it remains a pilgrimage for sailors and cruisers,
              a monument to human courage and the sea's indifference.

          <section class="port-section" id="landing">
            <h2>The Landing (When Possible)</h2>
            <p>
              If weather permits, cruise ships deploy Zodiacs to a small beach
              on Hornos Island. From there, wooden stairs ascend to the plateau
              where the monuments stand.
            </p>
            <h3>What You'll See</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Albatross Memorial</strong>: The iconic cut-out sculpture of an albatross in flight, honoring the mariners who died rounding the Horn.</li>
              <li><strong>Lighthouse</strong>: A Chilean navy lighthouse maintained by a keeper who lives on the island with their family.</li>
              <li><strong>Chapel</strong>: Small Stella Maris chapel.</li>
              <li><strong>Passport Stamp</strong>: The lighthouse keeper will stamp your passport with the official Cape Horn stamp.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Landing Statistics</h3>
            <p>
              Depending on season and weather patterns, landing success rates
              range from 25-50% of cruise attempts. Some ships never get the
              opportunity despite multiple tries. The experience is precious
              precisely because it's not guaranteed.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="port-section" id="if-no-landing">
            <h2>If Landing Isn't Possible</h2>
            <p>
              When weather prevents landing, ships typically sail as close as
              safely possible. You'll still see Horn Island and the headland—
              dramatic and atmospheric even from the ship. The captain may
              circle to give all passengers a view.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many consider "rounding the Horn"—sailing south of the cape—a
              significant achievement even without landing. You've still
              passed the legendary milestone.

          <section class="port-section" id="practical">
            <h2>Practical Information</h2>
            <h3>What to Wear</h3>
            <p>
              Assume extreme conditions. Wind is constant and fierce.
              Waterproof outer layers essential. Gloves, hat, neck gaiter.
              Dress warmer than you think—adrenaline won't protect you from
              hypothermia.
            </p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>
              Protect your camera from spray and rain. Time at the monuments
              is limited (typically 20-40 minutes). The albatross sculpture
              is THE shot—position yourself well quickly.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              The Zodiac landing on a rocky beach requires moderate mobility.
              Stairs to the memorial are steep and wet. If landing conditions
              are marginal, expedition staff will assess individual capability.
