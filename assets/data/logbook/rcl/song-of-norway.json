      "markdown": "**Song of Norway launched in November 1970 as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's first ship.**\n\nShe wasn't the first cruise ship ever built. But she was the first ship purpose-built for [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html), and she established the design philosophy that would define the company: modern, Scandinavian-inspired interiors, floor-to-ceiling windows, outdoor decks designed for sunshine and ocean views.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Entered service: November 7, 1970\n- Gross tonnage: 18,416 GT (originally 18,000 GT; stretched in 1978)\n- Capacity: 724 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Length: 534 feet (originally); stretched to 690 feet in 1978\n- Built by: Wärtsilä shipyard, Finland\n- Primary routes: Seven-night Caribbean loops from Miami\n- Signature feature: Viking Crown Lounge—a glass observation lounge perched above the ship's funnel\n- Retired: 1996 (sold, became Sun Viking, later scrapped 2004)\n\n**What made Song of Norway significant:**\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge became Royal Caribbean's signature. Every major ship in the fleet would feature some version of it—a high observation lounge with panoramic views. It's still there on modern ships, evolved but recognizable.\n\nShe proved the Scandinavian-modern design aesthetic worked for Caribbean cruising: light woods, clean lines, large windows, outdoor spaces that prioritized sun and sea. This wasn't ornate British ocean liner design—it was something new.\n\nSong of Norway's success led directly to [Song of America](/ships/rcl/song-of-america.html) (1982) and Nordic Prince, establishing Royal Caribbean as a legitimate competitor in Caribbean cruising."

      "markdown": "**Documented passenger praise (from reviews and historical records):**\n\n\"Clean, modern, bright. Not stuffy like the old ocean liners.\"\n\n\"The Viking Crown Lounge at night—drinks, live music, 360-degree views. You felt like you were floating above the ocean.\"\n\n\"Seven nights, affordable, reliable. She wasn't fancy, but she delivered exactly what she promised.\"\n\n\"First Caribbean cruise for thousands of Midwestern families. She made cruising accessible.\"\n\n**Industry impact:**\n\nSong of Norway established the seven-night Caribbean cruise as the industry standard. Before her, Caribbean cruising was more experimental. Song of Norway proved the route, the itinerary, and the ship design could sustain a profitable business.\n\nHer 1978 stretching (cutting the ship in half and inserting a 85-foot mid-section) pioneered the practice of ship lengthening—something Royal Caribbean and other lines would do repeatedly in the 1980s and 1990s to extend ship lifespans and add capacity.\n\nBy the time she was sold in 1996, Song of Norway had introduced hundreds of thousands of passengers to Caribbean cruising. Many went on to sail newer, larger ships—but they started with Song of Norway.\n\n**The Viking Crown Lounge legacy:**\n\nEvery [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) ship from 1970 through the mid-2000s featured some version of the Viking Crown Lounge. [Voyager class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) moved away from the external structure, but the concept—high observation lounge with panoramic views—remains central to Royal Caribbean design philosophy.\n\nSong of Norway died so that [Voyager](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), and [Icon](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) could live."
