        <h2>My South Pacific Day – A First-Person Account</h2>
        <p>Overwater bungalows, lagoons so turquoise they look photoshopped, and smiles that melt your heart – the South Pacific is cruising's end-game (5.0 across the board).</p>

        <p>In <strong>Bora Bora</strong> my perfect day is the jet-ski circumnavigation or a private lagoon tour with stingrays and sharks (they're friendly!). <strong>Moorea's</strong> Belvedere lookout and pineapple fields are stunning. <strong>Tahiti's</strong> black-sand beaches and waterfalls feel otherworldly.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Floating in Bora Bora's lagoon as a stingray glides beneath me and Mount Otemanu rises like a green cathedral from the water – the South Pacific doesn't just meet your paradise expectations, it quietly whispers that you've been dreaming too small your whole life.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Fiji's</strong> cloud-break surfing and kava ceremonies connect you to ancient traditions. <strong>Vanuatu's</strong> blue holes and active volcanoes are adventures waiting to happen. <strong>Nouméa's</strong> French-Pacific fusion croissants and protected lagoons blend European café culture with Melanesian warmth. Every island feels like winning the lottery.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Most South Pacific ports are <strong>tender ports</strong> with crystal-clear water rides to shore – the tender is half the fun. Book excursions through the ship or local operators at the dock. Water taxis and small boats are the primary transport between islands and attractions.</p>

      <!-- Word of Warning -->
      <section style="background:#fef9e7;border-left:5px solid #f4d03f;padding:1rem 1.25rem;margin:1.5rem 0;border-radius:8px;">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>A Positively Worded Word of Warning:</strong> The laid-back "island time" is the South Pacific's greatest luxury – let go of the watch and float in paradise longer than you ever thought possible.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details><summary>Is Bora Bora really as beautiful as the photos?</summary><p>More beautiful. The colors are so vivid they look enhanced, but it's all real. A lagoon tour with snorkeling is non-negotiable – you'll swim with rays and reef sharks in water so clear it's surreal.</p></details>
        <details><summary>What's a kava ceremony like in Fiji?</summary><p>Kava is a mildly sedative root drink central to Fijian culture. The ceremony is welcoming and communal. The taste is earthy (like muddy water, honestly) but the experience is unforgettable and the numbness is real.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Which South Pacific island is best for first-timers?</summary><p>Bora Bora is the iconic bucket-list choice. Fiji is more affordable with incredible snorkeling and culture. Moorea is quieter and equally beautiful with easier access from Tahiti.</p></details>
