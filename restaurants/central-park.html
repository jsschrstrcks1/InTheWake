      <h3>Central Park Review: A Garden Oasis at Sea</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Central Park exceeded every expectation I had going in. The concept of a real park with living plants in the middle of a cruise ship sounds like a gimmick until you experience it. Walking through in the evening with live music playing, trees softly lit, and the sky visible above is genuinely magical.</p>

      <h4>The Environment</h4>
      <p>The plantings are lush and mature—these aren't little potted plants but actual trees that have been growing for years. The landscape design creates different zones as you walk through, from open gathering areas to more intimate nooks. A dedicated horticulture team maintains everything, and it shows.</p>

      <h4>Dining</h4>
      <p>We had dinner at 150 Central Park (our anniversary splurge) and it was outstanding. The experience of dining in an intimate restaurant that opens onto the park is unique. We also grabbed breakfast at Park Cafe (free) which offers excellent pastries and made-to-order items.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Evenings are when Central Park really comes alive. Strolling musicians, soft lighting, and couples enjoying drinks at outdoor tables create a romantic ambiance. The Rising Tide Bar—a bar that literally rises between decks—is a fun novelty. We found ourselves returning every evening.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Central Park is reason enough to book an Oasis or Icon Class ship. It transforms the cruise experience by offering a space that feels genuinely different from typical ship environments. <strong>Rating: 5.0/5.</strong> Don't miss evening strolls and at least one specialty dining experience here.</p>
