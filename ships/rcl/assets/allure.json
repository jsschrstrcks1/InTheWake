      "markdown": "## Disclosure\nAffiliate links ahead. You pay what you’d pay on Royal Caribbean; your clicks help keep these free ship notes afloat.\n\n## Intro\nAllure of the Seas looked like a movie set — Boardwalk on one side, gardens on the other, and a whole family’s worth of possibilities in between. We sailed with teens, a grade-schooler, a toddler, and grandpa in a wheelchair. Verdict: everyone got a win.\n\n**Our price check:** Inside near **~$829 pp** when we booked; Balcony for grandparents closer to **~$1,199 pp** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nDoors opened, elevators appeared, and names were learned by day two. Crew offered help *right* — not pity, not performance — and pointed us toward the smoothest routes without making a fuss.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nThe ice show was a family jaw-dropper; the open-air high-diving venue under the stars gave us goosebumps. Parades on the Promenade, carousel rides at the Boardwalk, and late-night guitar in the pub stitched together a greatest-hits week.\n\n## Dining\n**Main Dining Room** handled our allergy with quiet confidence. **Chops** for steak night, **Giovanni’s** for pasta, **Izumi** for a playful detour; Windjammer kept snacks and smiles coming. Pro move: grab a garden bench in Central Park for a calm coffee.\n\n## Real Talk\nPool chairs go early; Wi-Fi slows **far out to sea/peak usage**. We adjusted and kept the fun rolling.\n\n## Accessible Seas\n- Elevators and wide routes to major venues → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/disability-at-sea.html\n- Pool/whirlpool lifts available on request\n- Accessible staterooms with roll-in showers → https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/ships/rcl/allure-of-the-seas.html#accessible\n- Crew proactively pointed out hard-surface alternatives when the crowd thickened.\n\n## Closing\nAllure felt like five vacations stacked into one ship. If your family spans toddlers to grandparents, it works.",
