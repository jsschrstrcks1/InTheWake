      "markdown": "**Vista launched in 2023 as Oceania's largest ship—establishing the Allura Class that represents the brand's evolution while maintaining culinary excellence.**\n\nAt 1,200 guests, Vista nearly doubles the capacity of Oceania's beloved R Class ships while preserving the intimate atmosphere that defines the brand. The challenge: scaling without diluting what made Oceania distinctive.\n\nThe ship introduces new venues and amenities impossible on smaller ships: expanded spa, additional dining options, larger staterooms. Yet the atmosphere remains country-club elegant rather than mega-ship overwhelming.\n\n[Allura](/ships/oceania/allura.html) follows as sister ship, confirming the Allura Class as Oceania's future direction. The brand is growing—but carefully, preserving core identity.\n\nFor fleet context: Vista tests whether Oceania's upper-premium formula can scale. Early indications suggest yes—guests report the same experience they loved on smaller ships, now with enhanced facilities.",

      "markdown": "**Oceania stakes reputation on 'Finest Cuisine at Sea.' Vista tests that claim at larger scale—and delivers.**\n\nThe Grand Dining Room maintains the quality that made Oceania famous. No reservations required. No upcharges for specialty restaurants. The open-seating model treats every meal as special occasion.\n\nJacques Pépin's influence pervades—his partnership with Oceania shapes menus, techniques, and culinary philosophy. The Culinary Center offers hands-on cooking classes in proper teaching kitchen.\n\nSpecialty venues expand on smaller ships' offerings: Toscana for Italian, Polo Grill for steakhouse, Red Ginger for Pan-Asian. All included. All excellent.\n\nRoom service delivers restaurant-quality meals anytime. The commitment to culinary quality extends beyond restaurants to every food encounter aboard.\n\nFor culinary priorities: Vista proves Oceania's claim survives scaling. The larger ship offers more dining options without sacrificing the quality that defines the brand.",

Vista preserves that balance at larger scale.**\n\nThe dress code—country club casual—captures the essence. No formal nights with tuxedos and gowns. No ultra-casual poolside attire in restaurants. The middle ground attracts guests who appreciate quality without performance.\n\nThe demographic skews older and more experienced. Fellow passengers have traveled extensively. Conversation flows easily over dinners that extend naturally. The social atmosphere rewards engagement without demanding it.\n\nVista's larger size provides more space per guest than mega-ships offer. The atmosphere never feels crowded or rushed. Deck space accommodates relaxation. Restaurants seat guests comfortably.\n\nFor couples seeking sophisticated relaxation: Vista delivers Oceania's proven formula with enhanced facilities. The larger ship doesn't sacrifice the intimate atmosphere that defines the brand.",
