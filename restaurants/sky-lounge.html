      <h3>Sky Lounge Review: Sunsets & Sophistication</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> We discovered Sky Lounge on our second sea day and it became our evening ritual — arrive before sunset, order cocktails, and watch the sky transform. It's exactly what a cruise lounge should be.</p>

      <h4>The View</h4>
      <p>The floor-to-ceiling windows are the star. We positioned ourselves facing west and watched a Caribbean sunset that cycled through every shade of orange, pink, and purple. The ocean stretched to the horizon in every direction. It's meditative — you forget you're on a ship until the gentle motion reminds you.</p>

      <h4>The Cocktails</h4>
      <p>The bartenders know their craft. I had a "Sky at Dusk" (their signature creation) that was perfectly balanced — not too sweet, with subtle smoke notes. My wife tried a classic French 75 that was textbook. The drink package worked here, which made experimenting easy.</p>

      <h4>The Evening Vibe</h4>
      <p>After sunset, the atmosphere shifted. A jazz trio started playing, conversation buzzed, and the space became more energetic without losing its elegance. By 10 PM there was dancing. It's not a nightclub — more like a sophisticated cocktail party where everyone's invited.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Sky Lounge became our favorite spot on the ship. The views alone are worth visiting; add good drinks and evening entertainment, and it's essential. Tip: arrive 30 minutes before sunset to claim window seats.</p>
