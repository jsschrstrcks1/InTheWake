          <summary><h2>My Thoughts: Chasing Hemingway's Ghost</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
              <p>The Bahamas begin here — a chain of 700 islands stretching southeast from this tiny archipelago just 50 miles off the Florida coast. As my ship approached Bimini, I could see why Hemingway fell in love with this place. The water shifted from deep Atlantic blue to impossible shades of turquoise and aquamarine, so clear I could see the sandy bottom from the deck. Bimini is barely a speck on the map: North Bimini and South Bimini together barely exceed seven square miles. Yet these islands punch far above their weight in legend and lore. Ernest Hemingway spent his summers here in the 1930s, battling marlin in the Gulf Stream and writing parts of what would become "Islands in the Stream."</p>

              <p>I stepped off at Resorts World Bimini, the purpose-built cruise facility that now welcomes most visitors to these islands. The resort sprawls along North Bimini's northern tip with pools, beach chairs, a casino, and all the amenities you'd expect from a modern cruise destination. However, I had my sights set elsewhere. I rented a golf cart for $60 — the standard transportation here — and headed south along King's Highway toward Alice Town. The road is barely one lane wide, lined with colorful clapboard buildings in shades of pink, yellow, and turquoise. This felt like the real Bimini, the island that existed before the cruise ships came.</p>

              <p>In Alice Town, I found what remained of Hemingway's Bimini. The original Compleat Angler bar, where he drank and brawled and held court over his catches, burned down in 2006. A rebuilt version carries on the tradition, its walls covered with black-and-white photographs of the great man holding fish larger than himself. I ordered a Kalik, the local Bahamian beer, and studied those images — marlin and tuna hauled from the Gulf Stream that still runs past these shores, unchanged since Hemingway's day. Though the bar is different, the water outside the window is exactly what he saw. That continuity moved me more than I expected.</p>

              <p>The waters off Bimini run deep and blue, the continental shelf dropping away just offshore where the Gulf Stream rushes north carrying everything from tuna to sailfish. I joined a snorkeling tour ($75) to see the famous Bimini Road, that mysterious underwater formation discovered in 1968. The boat ride out took just fifteen minutes, and then I slipped into water so clear it felt like floating in air. Below me, arranged in an unmistakable J-shape, lay massive rectangular limestone blocks — some as long as fifteen feet, fitted together with uncanny precision. Scientists debate whether it's natural beach rock fractured by geology, but swimming above those ancient-looking stones in fifteen feet of crystalline water, I understood why some people believe this is Atlantis.</p>

              <div class="poignant-highlight">
                <strong>The Moment I'll Remember:</strong> Floating face-down above the Bimini Road, watching sunlight ripple across stones that have sparked decades of mystery. Whether they're natural formations or something stranger, the experience of hovering above that geometric pattern in gin-clear water felt genuinely otherworldly. I stayed until the boat captain called me back, reluctant to leave the mystery behind.
              </div>

              <p>My afternoon took me to the beaches. Radio Beach, accessible by golf cart from Alice Town, offered soft sand and gentle waves perfect for swimming. I found a spot in the shade of a sea grape tree and watched pelicans dive for fish while the afternoon breeze kept the heat bearable. The beach had maybe a dozen people — nothing like the crowds at Resorts World. This quieter side of Bimini felt like discovering a secret, though locals surely know it well. For travelers with mobility needs, the resort beaches offer better accessibility with wheelchair-accessible pathways to the sand, though Radio Beach requires navigating unpaved paths.</p>

              <p>Before heading back to the ship, I stopped at a roadside stand for fresh conch salad ($12). The vendor prepared it while I watched — diced conch mixed with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and citrus, served in a foam cup with saltine crackers. It tasted like the sea itself, fresh and bright and impossibly local. In contrast to the resort's buffet options, this felt authentically Bahamian. I asked the vendor about Hemingway, and she laughed. "Every tourist asks about Hemingway," she said. "But he was just a fisherman who wrote books. The fishing is still here. The fish don't care about famous writers."</p>

              <p>I recommend Bimini for travelers seeking an easy taste of the Bahamas without the overwhelming scale of Nassau. Though the Resorts World facility dominates the cruise experience, venture beyond it and you'll find an island that still moves at its own pace. The snorkeling is exceptional, the beaches uncrowded, and Hemingway's ghost lingers in the rum bars of Alice Town. On the other hand, if you're seeking shopping, nightlife, or extensive cultural attractions, Bimini may feel limited. This is a place for sand between your toes and salt in your hair, for swimming above mysteries and drinking beer where legends once held court.</p>

          <summary><h2>Cruise Port Overview</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Resorts World Bimini serves as the primary cruise facility, a purpose-built destination on North Bimini's northern end designed specifically for cruise visitors. The resort includes a massive pool complex, beach access with loungers ($15-25 rental), a casino, multiple restaurants, and water sports rentals. Ships dock directly at the pier — no tendering required — and passengers can walk immediately into the resort complex.</p>

            <p>The facility operates as a self-contained beach day experience. You can easily spend your entire port call here without venturing further: swim in the pools, lounge on the beach, try the water sports, eat at the restaurants, and gamble at the casino. However, this means missing the authentic Bimini that exists beyond the resort gates. Alice Town, the main settlement, lies a short taxi ($10-15) or golf cart ride south.</p>

            <p>For accessibility, Resorts World offers paved pathways throughout the resort and wheelchair-accessible routes to the beach area. Beach wheelchairs may be available upon request — check with the resort when you arrive. The pools have lift access. Beyond the resort, Alice Town's infrastructure is basic, with some unpaved areas and limited accessibility accommodations.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Bimini is small enough that transportation options are simple but essential if you want to explore beyond the resort:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Golf Cart Rental ($50-70/day):</strong> The primary way to explore Bimini independently. Multiple rental stands operate near the cruise port. No special license required — if you can drive a car, you can drive a golf cart. King's Highway runs the length of North Bimini, making navigation simple. Most rentals include a basic map.</li>
              <li><strong>Taxi ($10-20):</strong> Available at the cruise port for rides to Alice Town or other destinations. Agree on price before departure. Good option for one-way trips if you plan to walk back or take a different route.</li>
              <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Feasible within Alice Town or the resort complex, but not practical for exploring the full island. The cruise port to Alice Town is about 2 miles — walkable but hot. Bring water and sun protection if walking.</li>
              <li><strong>Ferry to South Bimini ($5-10):</strong> A short ferry ride connects North and South Bimini. South Bimini offers quieter beaches and nature trails, plus the Bimini Biological Field Station studying lemon sharks.</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Resorts World Bimini offers the best accessibility infrastructure with paved paths and beach wheelchair options. Beyond the resort, roads are often unpaved or in rough condition. Golf carts can navigate most terrain, but wheelchair users will find limited options outside the resort area.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Resorts World Beach:</strong> Convenient but crowded on ship days. Lounger rentals $15-25. Water sports available. Good for families wanting easy access and amenities. Wheelchair-accessible pathways to sand.</li>
              <li><strong>Radio Beach:</strong> Local favorite south of Alice Town. Less developed, fewer amenities, but also fewer crowds. Soft sand and calm water. Accessible by golf cart; park along the road and walk in.</li>
              <li><strong>Blister Bay:</strong> On South Bimini, reached by ferry. Quieter and more remote. Good for those seeking solitude. Basic facilities only.</li>
              <li><strong>Honeymoon Harbour:</strong> Popular with stingray encounters — wild rays gather here and can be fed (bring squid from the fish market). Boat trip required ($40-60 excursion).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Water conditions:</strong> Generally calm with gentle waves. Water temperature stays warm year-round (75-85°F). Currents can be stronger on the Atlantic side — stick to marked swimming areas.</p>

          <summary><h2>Top Excursions &amp; Things to Do</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Popular snorkeling tours can fill up — book ship excursions ahead for guaranteed spots, or book with local operators at the port for flexibility. Independent exploration via golf cart is easy and rewarding.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Bimini Road Snorkeling ($60-80)</h4>
            <p>ESSENTIAL for the curious. The mysterious underwater formation of rectangular limestone blocks lies about a half-mile offshore in 15-20 feet of water. Whether ancient road, natural beach rock, or something stranger, swimming above those geometric stones is unforgettable. Tours last 2-3 hours including boat ride and snorkel time. Ship excursions and local operators both available. Book ahead in peak season for guaranteed return to ship.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sapona Shipwreck Snorkeling ($50-70)</h4>
            <p>A concrete ship wrecked during a 1926 hurricane now sits in shallow water south of the islands. The superstructure rises above the surface while fish swirl through the holds below. Excellent for snorkeling and photography. Often combined with Bimini Road tours. Water depth around the wreck is 10-15 feet — accessible for intermediate snorkelers.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Alice Town Walking Tour (Free-$25)</h4>
            <p>Explore Hemingway's Bimini on foot. Visit the rebuilt Compleat Angler bar with its historic photos, browse the small shops along King's Highway, and get a sense of local island life. Self-guided is free; guided tours ($20-25) add historical context. Allow 1-2 hours. Good activity for those wanting to escape the resort bubble.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Stingray Encounter at Honeymoon Harbour ($40-60)</h4>
            <p>Wild southern stingrays gather at this shallow sandbar where locals have fed them for years. Wade in waist-deep water as rays glide around you. Bring squid (available at the fish market, $5) or join a tour that provides food. Gentle and safe when you follow guides' instructions. Great for families with kids.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Deep Sea Fishing Charter ($400-800 half day)</h4>
            <p>Follow Hemingway's wake into the Gulf Stream for marlin, tuna, wahoo, and mahi-mahi. The continental shelf drops away just offshore, bringing big game fish within reach of small boats. Half-day charters for up to 4-6 people; full-day trips venture further. Book ahead through the resort or Alice Town charter offices.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Shark Research Center Visit ($10-15)</h4>
            <p>The Bimini Biological Field Station on South Bimini studies lemon sharks and other marine life in these pristine waters. Depending on timing and research schedules, visitors can sometimes observe the work and learn about shark conservation efforts. Take the ferry to South Bimini and arrange in advance for guided tours. Educational and unique — definitely not your typical cruise port activity, but memorable for those interested in marine biology.</p>

              <li><strong>Roadside Conch Stands ($8-15):</strong> Fresh conch salad prepared while you watch — diced conch with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and citrus. The most authentically Bahamian food you'll find. Look for stands along King's Highway in Alice Town.</li>
              <li><strong>Captain Bob's ($$):</strong> Local favorite in Alice Town serving cracked conch, fried fish, and Bahamian staples. Casual atmosphere, cold beer, views of the harbor. Budget $15-25 per person.</li>
              <li><strong>Stuart's Conch Stand ($):</strong> Famous for conch salad and scorched conch. Cash only. Simple setting, exceptional freshness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Local specialties:</strong> Conch (salad, cracked, or scorched), Bahamian cracked lobster, johnnycake, and pigeon peas and rice. Kalik is the local beer; try a Goombay Smash cocktail for island vibes.</p>

          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Bimini occupies an interesting space in the cruise world — close enough to Miami to visit on the shortest Bahamas itineraries, yet remote enough to feel like a genuine escape. The tension between Resorts World's modern cruise facility and Alice Town's sleepy charm creates two very different experiences available on the same island.</p>

            <p>For many passengers, the resort is enough: pools, beach, casino, restaurants, all without leaving the cruise company's carefully managed environment. There's nothing wrong with this approach. However, I found Bimini's soul lies beyond those gates — in the conch stands of Alice Town, the historic photos at the Compleat Angler, the mysterious stones of the Bimini Road, and the quiet beaches where locals outnumber tourists.</p>

            <p>The Hemingway connection gives Bimini a literary weight that most Bahamas islands lack. Though his bar burned down and his fishing records have long been surpassed, something of his restless spirit remains. Standing at the rebuilt Compleat Angler with a cold Kalik, looking at the same Gulf Stream waters he watched while writing novels that would change American literature, I felt connected to a larger story than my own port day.</p>

            <p>Bimini won't overwhelm you with activities or attractions. It's small, simple, and content to remain so. For travelers who want an easy beach day with resort amenities, it delivers. For those willing to rent a golf cart and explore, it offers something rarer — a glimpse of the Bahamas before the cruise ships transformed them, still visible in the colorful houses and unhurried rhythms of Alice Town.</p>

          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Bimini?</strong><br>A: Most cruise ships dock at Resorts World Bimini on North Bimini's northern end. The resort includes beaches, pools, casino, and restaurants. Ships dock directly — no tendering required.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is the Bimini Road?</strong><br>A: An underwater formation of large rectangular limestone blocks arranged in a J-shape, about a half-mile offshore in 15-20 feet of water. Some believe it's evidence of Atlantis; scientists debate whether it's natural beach rock. Either way, snorkeling above it is fascinating — the blocks are unmistakably geometric.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why is Bimini associated with Hemingway?</strong><br>A: Ernest Hemingway spent summers in Bimini during the 1930s, fishing for marlin in the Gulf Stream and writing. The Gulf Stream runs close to shore here, bringing big game fish within reach of small boats. He wrote parts of "Islands in the Stream" while staying on the island. The Compleat Angler bar (rebuilt after a fire) displays photos from his time there.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I get around Bimini?</strong><br>A: Golf carts are the standard transportation — rent one for $50-70/day at the cruise port. Taxis are also available for about $10-15 to Alice Town. The island is small enough to explore in a few hours by cart.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Bimini wheelchair accessible?</strong><br>A: Resorts World Bimini has paved pathways and accessible beach routes. Beyond the resort, infrastructure is basic with unpaved roads in many areas. Golf carts can help with mobility, but wheelchair accessibility outside the resort is limited. Beach wheelchairs may be available at the resort — inquire upon arrival.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Should I stay at the resort or explore the island?</strong><br>A: Both are valid choices. The resort offers convenience, amenities, and easy beach access. Exploring via golf cart reveals the authentic island — Alice Town's colorful streets, local food, and quieter beaches. I recommend doing both if time allows: morning at the resort, afternoon exploring by golf cart.</p>
