          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The coast of Senegal appeared through morning haze as our ship approached Dakar—Africa's westernmost point, where the continent reaches into the Atlantic like a hand extended in greeting. I had read about Teranga, the Senegalese concept of hospitality that supposedly permeates everything here, but words couldn't prepare me for what awaited. The air carried salt and smoke and something floral I couldn't identify as we docked at the busy commercial port, fishing boats bobbing alongside container ships, the city rising in tiers of white and ochre buildings behind.</p>

            <p>My first destination was Gorée Island, twenty minutes by ferry from the port. The boat was crowded with tourists and locals, children running between passengers, vendors selling cold drinks before we even cast off. When the island emerged from the haze—pastel colonial buildings climbing a rocky slope, bougainvillea cascading from balconies—it seemed impossibly peaceful. However, I knew what this place represented, and that knowledge weighted every step I took on its cobblestoned streets.</p>

            <p>The House of Slaves stands near the waterfront, pink walls faded by centuries of salt air. Inside, our guide—a dignified man named Boubacar who had given this tour for thirty years—led us through cramped cells where enslaved Africans once waited for ships that would carry them to the Americas. The rooms were small, dark, suffocating even now with doors open to the breeze. Boubacar's voice remained steady as he described conditions, numbers, the separation of families. When we reached the Door of No Return—that famous archway opening directly onto the sea—I found myself unable to speak.</p>

            <p>Standing in that doorway, looking out at waves crashing against rocks below, my breath caught in my chest. Through this frame, millions of human beings had passed, never to see Africa again. The scale of suffering was incomprehensible, yet here I stood in the physical space where it happened. My eyes filled with tears I didn't try to hide. Around me, other visitors wept openly—Americans, Europeans, Africans returning to confront their ancestors' trauma. Boubacar waited in silence, allowing the moment its weight. Some places demand grief, and Gorée is one of them.</p>

            <p>Afterward, I wandered the island's quiet streets, past art galleries and small museums, past homes where Senegalese families still live. The contrast between present tranquility and past horror felt almost unbearable. I bought a small painting from a local artist—abstract figures in blue and gold—and we talked about memory, about how Gorée has become a pilgrimage site for the African diaspora. "People come here to cry," he said simply, "and then they feel better. That is why we keep this place."</p>

            <p>Back in Dakar, I hired a taxi to the African Renaissance Monument, a 49-meter bronze statue that dominates the city's skyline. The monument depicts a man, woman, and child emerging from a volcano, facing west toward the diaspora. We climbed inside the statue's base and took an elevator to the observation deck in the man's head—surreal and awe-inspiring, looking out through a bronze forehead at the city below. The sculptor was Senegalese; the construction was controversial; the result is undeniably powerful. I stood there feeling the weight of African resilience, the insistence on rising despite everything.</p>

            <p>The afternoon found me at Lac Rose—the Pink Lake—about an hour from central Dakar. The lake's waters really do turn pink, tinted by algae that thrive in its extreme salinity. Salt harvesters worked in the shallows, their bodies coated white with crystite, baskets balanced on their heads. I waded in up to my knees, the water so dense I floated effortlessly. The taste of salt on my lips, the pink shimmer under afternoon sun, the sight of those workers continuing labor their grandparents knew—it all felt impossibly vivid, almost unreal.</p>

            <p>Evening brought me to Sandaga Market in central Dakar, where I negotiated for fabric ($15 for several meters of wax-print cotton) and tried thiéboudienne—Senegal's national dish of fish, rice, and vegetables in tomato sauce. The flavors were complex and savory: palm oil, tamarind, the heat of scotch bonnet peppers. I sat on a plastic chair at a tiny stall, surrounded by the sounds of Wolof conversation and mbalax music, feeling grateful beyond measure for this day.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing in the Door of No Return, waves crashing below, tears streaming down my face as I tried to comprehend the incomprehensible. My heart ached with accumulated sorrow—not just for those who passed through this portal but for their descendants, for all the ways that wound continues to shape our world. Boubacar placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "It is right to cry," he said. "But also remember—we are still here. Africa is still here." That quiet defiance, that insistence on survival and dignity, stays with me still.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Dakar taught me that some places exist primarily to witness, to remember, to grieve. What I learned here will never leave me: that confronting difficult truth is necessary, that hospitality can coexist with sorrow, and that the human capacity for resilience—the Senegalese determination to welcome strangers warmly despite everything their ancestors endured—is the most profound gift one people can offer another.</p>

            <p>Cruise ships dock at the Port of Dakar on the Cape Verde Peninsula, one of West Africa's busiest commercial ports. The cruise terminal offers basic facilities—restrooms, small shops, and a tourist information desk. Taxis gather at the port exit; negotiate prices before departing. The Gorée Island ferry terminal is a short taxi ride from the cruise pier.</p>

            <p>Currency is the West African CFA Franc (XOF); ATMs available in central Dakar but scarce on Gorée Island. Bring cash for market purchases and tips. French is the official language; Wolof widely spoken. English limited but improving in tourist areas. Weather is tropical—hot year-round with rainy season July-September. Wheelchair accessibility is limited throughout Dakar and challenging on Gorée's cobblestones.</p>

          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Dakar's position at Africa's westernmost point made it pivotal in the transatlantic slave trade. Gorée Island, just three kilometers offshore, served as a holding point for captured Africans awaiting ships to the Americas. The House of Slaves, built in 1776, has become a global symbol of that trade's horror—though historians debate the precise numbers who passed through this particular building, its emotional significance is undeniable.</p>

            <p>Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, and Dakar has since become West Africa's most cosmopolitan city. The concept of Teranga—roughly translated as hospitality but encompassing generosity, respect, and warmth toward strangers—defines Senegalese self-understanding. Visitors consistently note how welcomed they feel despite language barriers and cultural differences.</p>

            <p>The African Renaissance Monument, completed in 2010, sparked controversy for its $27 million cost in a nation with significant poverty. Yet it has become a source of pride and a symbol of African aspiration. The statue faces west, toward the diaspora, inviting those scattered by slavery to remember their origins and connection to the motherland.</p>

            <p>Modern Dakar pulses with creative energy—fashion, music, and art scenes that influence the continent and beyond. Mbalax music, pioneered by Youssou N'Dour, fills the streets. Contemporary African art commands international attention. This is a city looking forward while honoring its past, a balance few places achieve so gracefully.</p>

              <summary>Where do cruise ships dock in Dakar?</summary>
              <p>Ships dock at the Port of Dakar on the Cape Verde Peninsula, one of West Africa's largest commercial ports. The cruise terminal has basic facilities. Taxis gather at the port exit for transport to attractions including the Gorée Island ferry terminal, which is a short ride away.</p>
            </details>

              <summary>Should I visit Gorée Island?</summary>
              <p>Yes—Gorée Island is essential for understanding the transatlantic slave trade and its legacy. The House of Slaves with its Door of No Return is profoundly moving. The 20-minute ferry ride and 3-4 hours on the island are well worth the time for any visitor seeking to engage honestly with African heritage.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Dakar safe for tourists?</summary>
              <p>Dakar is considered one of West Africa's safest cities for tourists. Exercise normal precautions: watch belongings in crowded markets, avoid displaying expensive items, and stay aware of surroundings. The Senegalese culture of Teranga means visitors typically experience warmth and helpfulness rather than hostility.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What is the best time to visit Pink Lake?</summary>
              <p>The lake is pinkest from November to June when algae activity peaks and rainfall is minimal. Morning and late afternoon light enhance the color for photography. The lake may appear less pink during rainy season (July-September) or immediately after heavy rains.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do I need French to visit Dakar?</summary>
              <p>Basic French phrases help significantly—"Bonjour" (hello), "Merci" (thank you), "Combien?" (how much?)—but many Senegalese in tourist areas speak some English. Guides at major sites typically speak English. Learning a few Wolof words ("Jërejëf" for thank you) delights locals.</p>
