      "markdown": "**I'd cruised twenty ships. None had prepared me for floating above the ocean on a platform.**\n\nThe Magic Carpet sounds like marketing fiction until you're standing on it. A cantilevered deck the size of a tennis court, moving between decks, extending fourteen feet beyond the ship's edge. Nothing but glass between you and the sea below.\n\n[Celebrity Edge](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-edge.html) invented something genuinely new. Not bigger. Not flashier. New.\n\nAt Deck 16, the Magic Carpet becomes a bar suspended in sky. I ordered a martini and watched the Caribbean stretch infinitely. The platform moved slightly with the ship\u2014alive, responsive, real. Not a gimmick. An experience.\n\nAt Deck 2, the same platform transforms into a tender loading zone, then a restaurant, then whatever the moment requires. The engineering is remarkable; the experience is transcendent.\n\n'This shouldn't work,' an architect beside me observed. 'The structural requirements alone...' He trailed off, unable to explain what he was seeing.\n\n'It works,' I said. 'That's what matters.'\n\n**The truth:** Edge's Magic Carpet justifies seeking this ship specifically. No competitor has replicated it. Nothing else at sea compares. See [our Edge Class guide](/articles.html).\n\nI've cruised Edge three times now. Every voyage, I spend hours on the Magic Carpet. The innovation is real.",

I chose [Celebrity Edge](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-edge.html) for Eden.\n\nEden is a three-deck vertical garden, part restaurant, part lounge, part performance space. Living plants everywhere. Light filtering through glass. The boundary between inside and outside deliberately blurred.\n\nI sat there for hours every day. Watching performers rehearse. Watching light change. Watching plants grow in ways Sarah would have narrated.\n\n'The philodendrons are thriving,' she would have said. 'Look at that monstera\u2014someone knows what they're doing.'\n\nI heard her voice in Eden. Not ghost, not hallucination\u2014just memory finding space to breathe. The living things held me while I processed dead things.\n\nThe staff noticed. They brought water without asking. Left me alone without abandoning. Professional kindness for obvious grief.\n\n'My wife loved gardens,' I told a server on the final night.\n\n'Then she would have loved this one,' the server replied simply.\n\n**The lesson:** Edge's Eden serves grief that needs beauty.",

      "markdown": "**Celebrity Edge was built in 2018. The accessibility shows.**\n\nOlder ships retrofit accessibility. Edge integrated it from the start. The difference is visible in every corridor, every venue, every experience.\n\nThe [accessible cabin](/accessibility.html) exceeded every previous cruise. Roll-in shower with actual space. Lowered closet rods I could reach. Balcony threshold that didn't catch my wheels. Details that assume wheelchair users are guests, not problems.\n\nBut the ship-wide accessibility impressed me more. The Magic Carpet has designated wheelchair spaces with unobstructed views. Eden's levels connect via accessible routes that don't feel like service corridors. Even the Rooftop Garden\u2014outdoor space on Deck 15\u2014provides wheelchair access to experiences usually reserved for walking passengers.\n\n'You designed this for wheelchairs,' I told a crew member.\n\n'We designed this for everyone,' she corrected. 'Wheelchairs are part of everyone.'\n\nSimple statement. Revolutionary thinking. So many ships design for walking passengers and add wheelchair access. Edge designed for humans and included wheelchairs naturally.\n\nThe specialty dining venues accommodated my chair without reconfiguring rooms. The theaters have wheelchair seating that's genuinely good, not segregated. The pool lifts work\u2014actually work, every time I tried.\n\n**The truth:** Edge represents current accessibility thinking. If older ships have frustrated you, try a ship built this decade. See [our accessible cruising guide](/accessibility.html).\n\nI cruise Edge specifically now. Premium cruise experience with premium accessibility. Finally, both together.\n\n**The lesson:** Accessibility means equal dignity, not special treatment.",

By night two, I knew three other solo travelers by name. By night four, we'd formed a dinner group.\n\n'Edge attracts solo travelers,' one of them explained. 'The spaces are designed for it.'\n\nShe was right. Eden's lounge seating clustered strangers naturally. The Rooftop Garden had benches facing views, not each other\u2014comfortable for joining or staying alone. Even the main dining room's 'any time' dining meant I could arrive solo and be seated with others or alone, my choice.\n\nThe Retreat Lounge\u2014Celebrity's suite class\u2014wasn't for me. But the Sunset Bar offered similar tranquility for everyone. I watched Caribbean sunsets with solo travelers and couples alike, conversations forming and dissolving naturally.\n\n'You're solo?' a couple asked on the final evening.\n\n'I was,' I said.

'More protected, more private, more... I don't know. More intimate.'\n\nThe privacy mattered. No neighbors visible, no railings separating our experience from theirs. Just our window to the ocean, opening or closing as we chose. Romantic by design, not accident.\n\nWe watched three sunsets from our Infinite Veranda. Each one, I curled against my husband while the sky turned colors. No getting dressed, no finding deck chairs, no sharing the moment with strangers. Just us and the Caribbean.\n\n**The truth:** Infinite Verandas transform cabin experience. If you've always booked balconies, try Edge's innovation.

Dinner became experience without sacrificing culinary seriousness.\n\nBut Raw on 5 impressed me most.

Main dining room service matched our specialty dining experiences on Carnival. The included food exceeded what we'd paid upcharges for previously. We didn't need specialty restaurants; we chose them for variety, not quality rescue.\n\nThe difference culminated in the crowd. Edge passengers seemed... calmer. No pool deck wars for loungers. No rush for buffet lines.
