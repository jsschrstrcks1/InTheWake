    <p class="subtitle">Royal Caribbean — Comedy Club</p>

    <p class="answer-line"><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Comedy Live is Royal Caribbean's dedicated comedy venue featuring professional stand-up comedians. The club offers multiple shows nightly: family-friendly (PG) early shows for all ages and adults-only (R-rated) late-night shows. All comedy shows are complimentary.</p>

    <p class="fit-guidance"><strong>Best For:</strong> Comedy lovers, couples seeking evening entertainment, groups looking for laughs, adults who enjoy edgier humor (late shows), and families wanting shared entertainment (early shows).</p>

    <div class="key-facts">
      <h3>Key Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> All shows complimentary (drinks extra)</li>
        <li><strong>Show Types:</strong> Family-friendly (PG) and adults-only (R-rated)</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 45 minutes per show</li>
        <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Not required — first-come, first-served</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Shows:</strong> Typically 2-4 shows per evening</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="lede">Because laughter is the best souvenir.</p>
    <p class="blurb">Royal Caribbean takes comedy seriously, booking professional comedians who've worked major clubs and toured nationally. The intimate venue creates the perfect atmosphere for stand-up — close enough to feel the energy, small enough that every seat works. The two-show format means families can enjoy clean humor early, while adults can return later for no-holds-barred comedy. <a href="/restaurants.html">Return to the Restaurants & Venues hub →</a></p>

    <h3>Show Types</h3>

      <h4>Family-Friendly Shows (PG)</h4>
      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Typical Time: 8:00–9:30 PM</p>
      <p>Clean comedy suitable for all ages. Comedians deliver observational humor, family situations, travel jokes, and cruise-themed material without profanity or adult content. Great for watching with kids or if you prefer cleaner humor.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="show-card" style="border-left:3px solid #d9b382;padding-left:1rem;margin:1.5rem 0;">
      <h4>Adults-Only Shows (R-Rated)</h4>
      <p class="tiny muted" style="margin:-.25rem 0 .5rem;">Typical Time: 10:00 PM and later · 18+ only</p>
      <p>The gloves come off. These late-night shows feature adult language, mature themes, and edgier material. The comedians often save their best stuff for these shows, knowing the audience is ready for anything. Popular and often crowded — arrive early.</p>
    </article>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The Comedians</h3>
    <p>Royal Caribbean books working professionals — comedians who've performed at major clubs, appeared on TV, and tour nationally. Each sailing features different performers, and comedians often do multiple shows throughout the cruise with different material. Quality varies (as with any live comedy), but most shows deliver genuine laughs.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Pro Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Late shows fill up:</strong> Arrive 15 minutes early for adults-only shows</li>
      <li><strong>Sit near the front:</strong> If you're comfortable with potential interaction</li>
      <li><strong>Sit in back:</strong> If you want to avoid being picked on</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple nights:</strong> Different material each show — go more than once</li>
      <li><strong>Drink in hand:</strong> Comedy pairs well with cocktails</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">Show times and ratings vary by sailing. Check your daily Cruise Compass for specific schedules. Some ships may host comedy in different venues (Royal Theater, conference rooms) rather than a dedicated club.</p>

      <h3>Comedy Live Review: Laughing at Sea</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> I've been to comedy clubs on land, and I wasn't sure how cruise ship comedy would compare. I was pleasantly surprised — the comedian on our sailing was legitimately funny, the venue worked perfectly, and the vacation crowd was primed to laugh.</p>

      <h4>The Early Show</h4>
      <p>We caught the 8:30 PM family show with our teenagers. The comedian was a touring pro who's been on TV (I recognized him). His clean material was clever — lots of observational humor about cruise ships, travel, and family dynamics. Smart jokes that worked for adults while staying appropriate for kids. My 14-year-old laughed harder than I'd seen in months.</p>

      <h4>The Late Show</h4>
      <p>After the kids went back to the cabin, my wife and I returned for the 10:30 PM adults-only show. Same comedian, completely different act. The R-rated material was genuinely funny — relationship humor, adult situations, and yes, profanity used effectively. The crowd was energetic, drinks were flowing, and the laughter was constant. It felt like a proper comedy club.</p>

      <h4>The Venue</h4>
      <p>Comedy Live on Harmony is an intimate room with maybe 150 seats. The layout puts everyone close to the stage, which creates great energy. The lighting was appropriately dim, drinks were easy to order, and the sound system was perfect — important for comedy where timing matters.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.2/5.</strong> Comedy Live exceeded expectations. The two-show format is brilliant — families can enjoy together early, adults can return for edgier material later. Quality depends on the specific comedian, but our sailing had a pro who delivered. Worth attending multiple nights as the material changes.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary><strong>Are comedy shows free on Royal Caribbean?</strong></summary>
        <p>Yes, all comedy shows at Comedy Live are complimentary and included in your cruise fare. No reservations or tickets needed — just show up. Drinks from the bar are extra or covered by drink packages.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Are there family-friendly comedy shows?</strong></summary>
        <p>Yes! Royal Caribbean offers PG-rated family-friendly shows earlier in the evening (typically 8-9:30 PM) that are appropriate for all ages. Adults-only R-rated shows run later (10 PM+).</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>How good are cruise ship comedians?</strong></summary>
        <p>Royal Caribbean books working professionals — comedians who've performed at major clubs, appeared on TV, and tour nationally. Quality varies as with any live entertainment, but most shows feature genuinely talented performers. The vacation atmosphere helps — audiences are relaxed and ready to laugh.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Should I sit in front or back?</strong></summary>
        <p>Front rows risk audience interaction (getting picked on by the comedian). If you enjoy that, sit close. If you prefer to just watch, choose seats further back. Middle sections are usually safe.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Can I attend multiple comedy shows?</strong></summary>
        <p>Absolutely! Comedians typically change their material between shows, so attending multiple nights gives you different jokes. The early and late shows also feature different material since they're tailored to different audiences.</p>
