      "markdown": "**Most Galápagos ships were built for elsewhere. Flora was built for here.**\n\n[Celebrity Flora](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-flora.html) launched in 2019 as the first ship designed specifically for Galápagos by Celebrity. Every design decision serves these islands.\n\nThe outward-facing layout places wildlife viewing before everything. The stabilizers minimize motion in volcanic waters. The zodiac platforms were engineered for Galápagos landing conditions. Nothing was adapted; everything was intended.\n\n'Other ships visit Galápagos,' the expedition leader explained. 'Flora belongs to Galápagos.'\n\nThe difference shows constantly. Viewing angles that work for wildlife, not retrofit guesses. Deck layouts that serve expedition purpose. A ship that anticipated rather than accommodated.\n\nI've sailed other Galápagos vessels. Flora's purpose-built design creates advantages accumulated across every feature.\n\n**The truth:** Flora represents Galápagos expedition as destination rather than adaptation. The purpose-built design advantages accumulate into genuinely better experience. See [our Galápagos guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Flora for Galápagos specifically. The ship belongs here. The design proves it.",

      "markdown": "**Expedition cabins are usually where you sleep. Flora's became where I lived.**\n\n[Celebrity Flora's](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-flora.html) Sky Suites feature infinite verandas—the Edge-class innovation adapted for expedition. Floor-to-ceiling windows that transform into open air. The Galápagos enters your room.\n\nI watched sea lions from my veranda at dawn. Frigatebirds circled past my windows at dusk. The expedition continued in my suite. The wildlife didn't stop at the cabin door.\n\nThe design acknowledges what expedition guests want: constant connection to destination. The infinite veranda delivers that without forcing deck exposure. Wildlife viewing from bed. Sunset watching from the sofa.\n\n'I've never had a cabin this connected,' my wife observed.\n\n'Because this cabin was designed for connection,' I explained.\n\n**The lesson:** Flora's infinite verandas transform expedition cabins from rest stops to viewing stations. The rooms serve the destination. See [our stateroom guide](/articles.html).\n\nI book Sky Suite on Flora specifically. The infinite veranda justifies the upgrade. The wildlife comes inside.",

His health required comfort. The Galápagos remained a dream until he died.\n\n[Celebrity Flora](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-flora.html) delivered the luxury expedition he'd wanted.\n\nThe premium accommodation didn't diminish the wildlife. The service didn't distance me from Darwin's islands. The comfort honored what he'd hoped to experience.\n\nEvery sea lion sighting became tribute. Every tortoise encounter became memorial. I photographed what he would have photographed. I marveled where he would have marveled.\n\n'You're experiencing this for two,' a naturalist observed.\n\n'For two,' I confirmed. 'He would have loved this ship especially.'\n\nFlora's luxury wasn't excess—it was exactly what Daniel had sought. Expedition without suffering. Adventure without sacrifice.\n\n**The truth:** Flora serves grief seeking luxury expedition. The comfort honors those who valued both adventure and refinement. See [In the Wake of Grief](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html).\n\nI cruise Flora when I miss him. The luxury expedition he wanted became my pilgrimage.",

The accessibility assumes wheelchair users want wildlife access, not just cabin rest.\n\nThe zodiacs include accessibility options when conditions permit. The ship's layout provides viewing angles my chair can reach. The expedition team researched accessible landings.\n\nNot everything worked. Some islands excluded my chair entirely. But more worked than I'd expected. The purpose-built design included me in design specifications.\n\n'You made it to Galápagos,' my caregiver said, watching blue-footed boobies.\n\n'The ship made it possible,' I corrected.\n\nFlora's accessibility isn't perfect. Expedition has inherent mobility challenges. But the intention to include wheelchair users was evident throughout.\n\n**The lesson:** Flora provides genuine expedition accessibility. Not every experience works for wheels, but the ship tries harder than most. See [our accessible cruising guide](/accessibility.html).\n\nI cruise Flora when wheelchair expedition seems possible.

By day two, everyone recognized everyone. By day four, solo labels had dissolved into community.\n\nThe shared wonder accelerated connection. Snorkeling with sea lions together. Photographing tortoises together. Marveling at evolution together. The Galápagos demanded shared experience.\n\nThe luxury elevated rather than isolated. Premium dining meant conversations across beautifully set tables. The expedition lounge gathered passengers for naturalist talks. Solo space existed when wanted; community appeared when needed.\n\n'You came alone?' became 'You came with us.'\n\n'The ship made solo feel like family,' I told a new friend.\n\n'One hundred people sharing wonder,' she replied. 'How could it not?'\n\n**The truth:** Flora serves solo travelers through intimate scale and shared wonder. The luxury doesn't isolate; the expedition unites. See [our solo cruise guide](/solo.html).\n\nI cruise Flora solo specifically. The intimate luxury creates connection naturally.",

Seafood from surrounding waters, prepared with technique that showed genuine training. Wine pairings that demonstrated sommelier knowledge.\n\n'This shouldn't be possible on an expedition ship,' my dining companion observed.\n\n'Flora isn't just an expedition ship,' I explained. 'It's a luxury expedition ship.'\n\nThe intimate guest count—100 passengers—meant personalized attention. Dietary preferences remembered. Favorite wines noted. The dining experience became relationship over voyage course.\n\nDesserts showed real pastry training. Cheeses knew their origins. The quality gap between expedition norm and Flora's reality remained vast.\n\n**The lesson:** Flora delivers genuine luxury dining on expedition vessel. The galley sets flagship standards.

Here's why I chose Flora.**\n\nBoth [Flora](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-flora.html) and Xpedition carry 100 passengers through Galápagos. Both offer Celebrity service. Both provide excellent expedition experience. The difference is luxury level.\n\nFlora was purpose-built for Galápagos; Xpedition was converted. Flora's suites feature infinite verandas; Xpedition's are more modest. Flora's dining is flagship quality; Xpedition's is excellent but simpler.\n\n'Why pay more for Flora?' friends ask.\n\n'Because the luxury enhances without diminishing expedition,' I explain.\n\nThe wildlife access is identical. Both ships follow same itineraries, visit same islands, employ same caliber naturalists. The expedition is equal. The accommodation differs.\n\nXpedition serves travelers prioritizing expedition over accommodation. Flora serves travelers wanting both. Neither is wrong—just different priorities.\n\n**The lesson:** Flora offers luxury upgrade over Xpedition. Same expedition, different comfort level. See [our Galápagos comparison guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Flora when budget permits. The expedition experience is identical. The living experience is not.",

The naturalist explained the adaptation timeline. The finches weren't just small birds. The evolutionary pressure that diversified them became visible.\n\nDarwin's insight—natural selection—became comprehensible standing where he'd stood. The naturalists connected observation to understanding. Wildlife viewing became wildlife education.\n\n'I've never understood evolution like this,' a fellow passenger admitted.\n\n'Because you've never stood in its laboratory with a teacher,' the naturalist replied.\n\nEvery landing included interpretation. Every zodiac cruise included context. The expedition wasn't just access—it was education.\n\n**The lesson:** Flora's naturalists transform Galápagos from seeing to understanding. The interpretation justifies expedition cruising. See [our expedition guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Flora specifically for the naturalists. The wildlife is everywhere.

The islands' protection matters, and Flora's design supports rather than undermines it.\n\n'How can cruising be sustainable?' skeptics ask.\n\n'By building ships that minimize harm,' I explain.
