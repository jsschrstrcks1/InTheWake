      <h3>The Loose Cannon Review: Craft Cocktails and Live Music Done Right</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Loose Cannon is a cocktail bar and live music venue on select Virgin Voyages ships — combining craft-forward drinks with acoustic and band performances in an intimate, pub-style setting. It sits alongside On The Rocks as one of the ship's dedicated live music destinations, but with a broader musical range (jazz, acoustic, singer-songwriter, and pop covers alongside rock) and a more cocktail-focused bar program. Bar Tab applies; no cover charge.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The cocktail menu is more creative here than at most ship bars. The "Loose Cannon" signature (rum, lime, ginger beer, and a float of dark rum) is essentially an elevated dark and stormy and it is excellent — spicy, balanced, and strong. The negroni is properly bitter and well-stirred. The draft cocktail program (pre-batched for consistency and speed) is a smart innovation — the old fashioned and the margarita both arrive fast and well-made. The wine selection is modest but adequate. Where it falls short: the bar can get overwhelmed during popular live music sets, and the craft cocktail ambition slips when bartenders switch to speed mode. The beer selection is limited compared to Draught Haus. Some of the more creative cocktails are inconsistent depending on the bartender.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Bartenders here are cocktail-focused — they can discuss spirits, recommend pairings, and adjust drinks to taste. The service style is more pub-like than formal: conversational, friendly, and relaxed. During live music, table service is available from roaming servers, which is a welcome touch that lets you enjoy the performance without queuing at the bar. Between sets, the bartenders engage in genuine conversation.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The Loose Cannon has the energy of a well-designed neighborhood cocktail bar — intimate, warm-lit, with excellent acoustics for live music. The performers are consistently good and the musical variety keeps things interesting across multiple evenings. The crowd tends to be smaller and more attentive than at On The Rocks, creating a listening atmosphere rather than a party atmosphere. Where it falls short: the space is small and fills quickly during popular performances. Standing room becomes the norm by 10 PM. The intimate size means noise levels can spike, especially during louder band performances. The venue can feel cramped on busy evenings.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> The Loose Cannon delivers a quality combination of craft cocktails and live music in an intimate setting — the signature cocktail is excellent, the bartenders are knowledgeable, and the musical programming provides genuine variety. It falls short on capacity (too small for the demand), cocktail consistency during busy sets, and beer selection. <em>Tip:</em> visit during the first set of the evening (usually 8-9 PM) when the crowd is manageable and the bartenders still have time for proper craft cocktails.</p>
