        <h1>San Francisco: Where the Fog Writes the Story</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>San Francisco greets you with fog. Not the dreary kind that makes you want to stay indoors, but the theatrical kind that rolls through the Golden Gate like it's been waiting backstage for this exact performance. It pours over the bridge towers, swallows the bay in gray-white billows, and then — just when you think the whole city might disappear — burns off to reveal hills stacked with pastel Victorian houses, water sparkling like hammered pewter, and a skyline that somehow manages to feel both metropolitan and intimate.</p>

          <p>The James R. Herman Cruise Terminal sits right on The Embarcadero, where the city's working waterfront meets its tourist heart. You can walk to Fisherman's Wharf in fifteen minutes, following the waterfront promenade past joggers, cyclists, and locals walking dogs who've seen a thousand cruise ships come and go. The clang of cable car bells echoes from a few blocks inland. Sea lions bark from Pier 39 like a welcoming committee that takes itself very seriously. This is a city that wears its personality on its sleeve — or rather, in its fog, on its hills, and in the cheerful chaos of its streets.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing mid-span on the Golden Gate Bridge as the fog rolled in from the Pacific. One minute I could see clear to the Marin Headlands, the next I was wrapped in gray cloud so thick I could barely see the person walking ten feet ahead. The bridge towers disappeared into white. The foghorn bellowed its deep, mournful warning. And I understood why this bridge isn't just engineering — it's mythology. When you're inside the fog, suspended 220 feet above water you can't see, trusting a span that's vanished into cloud, you realize why San Francisco gets under people's skin. The city makes you believe in things you can't quite see.
          </div>

          <p>If you only do one thing, make it Alcatraz. But book your tickets the moment you know your cruise dates — this isn't a "we'll figure it out when we get there" attraction. The ferry ride from Pier 33 takes you across choppy bay water to an island that managed to be America's most notorious federal prison while sitting in view of one of America's most beautiful cities. The audio tour is extraordinary — narrated by former guards and inmates, it turns cell blocks and mess halls into living history. You'll hear stories of desperate escape attempts, daily routines, and the psychological weight of being so close to freedom you could see its lights at night.</p>

          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Golden Gate Bridge</h4>
          <p>The 1.7-mile suspension bridge isn't just an icon — it's an experience. Walk or bike across (sidewalk access free). Fort Point sits underneath the south end, a Civil War-era fort with stunning bridge views. Pedestrian entrance near toll plaza; allow 1-2 hours for walk across and back. Bring layers — it's windy and often foggy mid-span. The Bridge Pavilion visitor center offers history and photos.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Alcatraz Island</h4>
          <p>Former federal prison (1934-1963) on island in San Francisco Bay. Ferry from Pier 33 (15 min ride) includes excellent audio tour narrated by former guards and inmates. See cells where Al Capone and Robert Stroud lived, hear escape stories, explore grounds with bay views. BOOK 2-4 WEEKS IN ADVANCE — tickets sell out. Allow 2.5-3 hours total including ferry. Worth every penny.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fisherman's Wharf & Pier 39</h4>
          <p>Historic waterfront district — seafood restaurants, sourdough bread shops (Boudin Bakery makes bread bowls daily), sea lions hauled out on floating docks (barking chorus year-round), street performers. Pier 39 has shops and bay views. Touristy but genuinely fun. Walk from cruise terminal (15 min). Clam chowder in sourdough bread bowl is mandatory. Half-day browsing and eating.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Cable Cars</h4>
          <p>Historic moving landmarks — three lines still operating since 1870s. Powell-Hyde and Powell-Mason lines most scenic, climbing Nob Hill and Russian Hill with bay views. $8 per ride (pay conductor). Turnaround at Powell & Market gets crowded; jump on mid-route. Stand on running board if you dare. Gripmen manually operate brakes on steep hills — it's equal parts transit and performance art.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Coit Tower</h4>
          <p>210-foot Art Deco tower atop Telegraph Hill (1933). Panoramic 360-degree views of city, bay, bridges. Inside: stunning Depression-era WPA murals depicting California life. Elevator to top $10. Climb the Filbert Street steps through flower gardens to reach tower (alternative to taxi). Allow 1-2 hours. Views rival anything you'll pay more for.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">North Beach (Little Italy)</h4>
          <p>Italian neighborhood clinging to hillside — family-run restaurants, espresso cafes, City Lights Bookstore (Beat Generation landmark), Washington Square Park. Authentic trattorias, focaccia bakeries, old-school cafes where regulars argue about bocce. Walk from Fisherman's Wharf (20 min). Less touristy, more soul. Perfect for mid-afternoon cappuccino and people-watching.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hyde Street Pier & Maritime Museum</h4>
          <p>Historic ships you can board — 1886 square-rigger Balclutha, 1890s ferry Eureka, steam schooner, tugboat. Part of San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Also nearby: USS Pampanito WWII submarine at Pier 45 (self-guided audio tour), Musée Mécanique (antique arcade games, free entry). Combined tickets available. 2-3 hours for serious maritime enthusiasts.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Chinatown</h4>
          <p>Oldest Chinatown in North America — enter through Dragon Gate at Grant Avenue & Bush. Narrow alleys (Ross Alley, Waverly Place), temples with incense smoke curling skyward, herbal medicine shops, dim sum restaurants, bakeries selling egg tarts and pork buns. Tin How Temple (1852) up steep stairs. Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory hand-folds cookies. 15 min walk from Embarcadero. Allow 2-3 hours to explore properly.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Waterfront from terminal to Fisherman's Wharf very walkable (15 min flat walk along Embarcadero). Hills get steep inland — wear comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cable Cars:</strong> $8 per ride (cash or Clipper card). Powell-Hyde and Powell-Mason lines most useful for tourists. Expect lines at turnarounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Muni (Bus/Streetcar):</strong> $3 per ride; F-Market historic streetcar runs along Embarcadero to Fisherman's Wharf (frequent, scenic, convenient).</li>
            <li><strong>BART:</strong> Bay Area Rapid Transit — underground rail system. Embarcadero station 20 min walk from terminal; useful for reaching downtown or Mission District.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxi/Uber/Lyft:</strong> Readily available. Expect $15-25 for most tourist destinations from cruise terminal.</li>
            <li><strong>Alcatraz Ferry:</strong> Departs Pier 33 (5 min walk from cruise terminal). Book online weeks in advance through official Alcatraz Cruises only.</li>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dungeness Crab:</strong> November-June season — sweet, tender crabmeat served cracked on ice, in cioppino (seafood stew), or on sourdough rolls. Fisherman's Wharf specializes.</li>
            <li><strong>Clam Chowder in Sourdough Bread Bowl:</strong> Touristy but delicious — creamy New England-style chowder served in hollowed-out sourdough loaf. Boudin Bakery perfected it.</li>
            <li><strong>Sourdough Bread:</strong> San Francisco's signature — tangy wild-yeast bread made with local starter cultures. Boudin's been baking since 1849 Gold Rush.</li>
            <li><strong>Ghirardelli Chocolate:</strong> Local chocolate maker since 1852. Ghirardelli Square near Fisherman's Wharf has shops and ice cream fountain. Hot fudge sundaes legendary.</li>
            <li><strong>Mission-Style Burrito:</strong> San Francisco creation — oversized flour tortilla stuffed with rice, beans, meat, cheese, salsa, sour cream. La Taqueria in Mission District considered best.</li>
            <li><strong>Craft Beer & Wine:</strong> Local breweries (Anchor Steam, 21st Amendment) and nearby Napa/Sonoma wines widely available. Irish Coffee at Buena Vista Cafe (original 1952 recipe).</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Alcatraz tickets sell out 2-4 weeks ahead — book immediately when cruise is confirmed. Official site only: alcatrazcruises.com</li>
            <li>Layer clothing — Mark Twain never said "coldest winter I spent was summer in San Francisco," but he should have. Fog brings chill even in July.</li>
            <li>Cable cars get mobbed at turnarounds (Powell & Market). Walk a few blocks uphill and board mid-route for better chance of riding outside.</li>
            <li>Skip tourist trap restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf main drag — walk one block inland for better food and prices. Or embrace the kitsch with clam chowder bread bowl.</li>
            <li>Sea lions at Pier 39 hauled out year-round, but peak numbers (hundreds) arrive January-July. They're loud, smelly, and utterly entertaining.</li>
            <li>F-Market historic streetcar runs vintage streetcars along Embarcadero — cheaper than cable car ($3 vs $8), same great views, much shorter lines.</li>
            <li>Golden Gate Bridge walkway closes to pedestrians during high winds. Check weather/alerts before planning bridge walk.</li>
            <li>Chinatown dim sum best before 2 PM. Point at steamer carts, try everything, cash preferred at traditional spots.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: James R. Herman Cruise Terminal at Pier 27 on The Embarcadero. Modern facility on northern waterfront, walkable to Fisherman's Wharf (15 min) and downtown.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Do I need to book Alcatraz tickets in advance?</strong><br/>A: YES. Book 2-4 weeks ahead through official Alcatraz Cruises website. Tickets sell out, especially summer. Ferry departs Pier 33 (5 min walk from cruise terminal).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I walk to the Golden Gate Bridge?</strong><br/>A: It's 3.5 miles from cruise terminal to bridge — doable but long walk (1 hour+). Better: take bus, Uber, or bike rental. Once there, pedestrian walkway is free and spectacular.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to see the city on cruise day?</strong><br/>A: If you have Alcatraz tickets, that's your day (3 hours total). Without Alcatraz: walk waterfront to Fisherman's Wharf, ride cable car, explore North Beach or Chinatown, maybe Coit Tower. City is walkable but hilly.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Will the weather be foggy?</strong><br/>A: Maybe! Summer (June-August) is foggiest. September-October warmest and clearest. Bring layers regardless — fog can roll in any time. That's part of the charm.</p>
