          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the shuttle bus into a Spain I didn't expect—green hills rolling to the horizon instead of sunbaked plains, Atlantic mist hanging in the morning air instead of Mediterranean glare, the distant sound of bagpipes echoing through stone streets. The smell of salt and fresh rain mingled with woodsmoke from somewhere nearby. Gijón sits at the heart of Asturias, the Celtic fringe of Spain they call España Verde, where the Bay of Biscay crashes against a coastline that feels more Scottish than Spanish. I had come expecting another cruise port; I found something far stranger and more beautiful.</p>

            <p>We walked straight toward Cimadevilla, the old fisherman's quarter perched on a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. Narrow cobblestone lanes climbed between colorful houses, their painted shutters thrown open to catch the morning light. I could hear seagulls crying overhead and the rhythmic slap of waves against the harbor wall. The stones beneath my feet had been worn smooth by centuries of fishermen's boots. An elderly woman emerged from a doorway, nodded at us with quiet dignity, and continued on her way. This was no tourist performance—this was a neighborhood where people still lived their daily lives against a backdrop of extraordinary beauty.</p>

            <p>At the headland's summit stood Eduardo Chillida's masterpiece: Elogio del Horizonte, In Praise of the Horizon. The massive concrete sculpture rises against the sky like cupped hands offering the ocean to the heavens. I walked inside its curved embrace and felt the Atlantic wind roar through the opening, creating a sound somewhere between a whisper and a hymn, a low moan that seemed to come from the sea itself. The sculpture frames nothing but water and weather, emptiness stretching to the curve of the earth. Yet that emptiness felt impossibly full of meaning. I stood there for twenty minutes, watching the light shift, listening to the wind's song change pitch, feeling the mist on my face. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected encounter with beauty so profound it brought tears to my eyes.</p>

            <p>Descending from the headland, we discovered the Termas Romanas—ancient Roman baths from the first century AD, excavated right in the middle of downtown. I walked through the hypocaust system where hot air once warmed the floors, touched stones that Roman bathers had touched two thousand years ago. The cool underground chambers smelled of earth and age. Gijón has been a port for millennia, a place where people have always looked out at the horizon and wondered what lies beyond. The Romans called this region the edge of the known world. Standing in their bathhouse, I felt that familiar shiver of deep time, the vertigo of realizing how briefly we occupy this earth.</p>

            <p>Lunch introduced me to Asturian cider culture—an experience utterly unlike anywhere else in Spain. In a traditional sidrería, sawdust covering the floor to absorb spilled cider, the server performed the ritual of escanciar: holding the bottle high overhead and pouring a thin golden stream into a wide glass held at hip level, aerating the cider into a brief fizz. You receive just a small pour—a culín—which you drink immediately before the fizz fades. Then the process repeats. The cider itself tasted sharp and tart, nothing like the sweet commercial versions I knew. We ate fabada Asturiana, the region's signature white bean stew with chorizo and morcilla, hearty fare for a maritime climate where rain comes often and warmth comes from within. The meal cost €18 and felt like an education.</p>

            <p>In the afternoon we walked the length of San Lorenzo Beach, golden sand stretching for over a mile in a perfect arc. The water was cold—this is the Atlantic, not the Mediterranean—but locals surfed in wetsuits, children built sandcastles, elderly couples strolled the promenade arm in arm. The beach sits right in the city center, apartment buildings rising on one side and open ocean stretching to the other. However, what struck me most was the normalcy of it all: this wasn't a resort, it was simply where people lived. The sound of waves mixed with Spanish conversation, with the clatter of café tables, with a busker playing accordion somewhere along the promenade.</p>

            <p>Before returning to the shuttle, I climbed back to Chillida's sculpture one last time. The late afternoon light had turned the concrete golden, the sea pewter, the sky a wash of salmon and gray. I thought about how different this Spain was from the Spain of postcards and tourist brochures—how the Celtic influence persisted in the green hills and rainy weather, how the cider ritual felt more Irish than Iberian, how the bagpipes we'd heard earlier in the day seemed perfectly at home. This is what I learned in Gijón: that Spain is not one thing but many, that authenticity often hides in the places cruise ships rarely visit, and that sometimes the most profound beauty waits at the edge of the world, framed by curved concrete, blessed by Atlantic wind.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at El Musel, Gijón's industrial port about 6 kilometers north of the city center. The port itself is a working commercial facility—not scenic, but functional. Free shuttle buses provided by the cruise line run to Plaza Mayor in the heart of town, a journey of approximately 15 minutes. Some lines charge €5-8 for the shuttle; check your ship's policy before docking.</p>

            <p>From Plaza Mayor, everything worth seeing lies within walking distance. The old town, San Lorenzo Beach, Roman baths, and the Chillida sculpture on Cimadevilla headland are all reachable on foot. Gijón is compact and designed for pedestrians, making it one of the easier Spanish ports to explore independently.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate.</strong> The city center is relatively flat, but reaching the Elogio del Horizonte sculpture requires climbing the Cimadevilla headland—a steady uphill walk on cobblestones. The Roman baths are underground with stairs. San Lorenzo Beach promenade is flat and accessible. Wheelchair users will find the beach promenade and modern areas manageable, but the old town's cobblestones and headland climb present challenges. Budget 5-7 hours for a thorough exploration including the sculpture, beach, and a proper sidrería lunch.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Shuttle service:</strong> Free or low-cost shuttles (€5-8) run from El Musel port to Plaza Mayor. Check your cruise line's policy—some include the shuttle in port fees, others charge separately. Shuttles typically run continuously during port hours. The ride takes approximately 15 minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> Once in the city center, walking is the best way to experience Gijón. From Plaza Mayor to San Lorenzo Beach: 10 minutes. To the Roman baths: 5 minutes. To Cimadevilla headland and Chillida sculpture: 20-25 minutes (including the climb). The old quarter involves cobblestones and some hills. Comfortable shoes essential.</p>

            <p><strong>City buses:</strong> EMTUSA operates efficient city buses (€1.40 per ride). Useful for reaching Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura on the outskirts (bus line 1). Route maps available at Plaza Mayor tourist office. Buses accept cash or contactless payment.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at taxi ranks near Plaza Mayor and along major streets (€8-15 for most in-city journeys). Metered fares. Useful for Laboral or if mobility is a concern. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, arrange a pickup time with your driver.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> typically include highlights like the Chillida sculpture, old town walking tour, and cider house visit ($80-120). Going <strong>independent</strong> saves money and allows more flexibility—the city is easy to navigate without guides. However, for Oviedo day trips (the regional capital, 30 minutes away), organized excursions handle logistics well. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Oviedo visits as they fill quickly.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The beach promenade, Plaza Mayor, and modern shopping areas are accessible. The old town has challenging cobblestones. The Chillida sculpture requires climbing the headland—not wheelchair accessible. The Roman baths involve stairs. Some taxi operators provide accessible vehicles; arrange through the tourist office.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Gijón rewards <strong>independent</strong> exploration—the compact city center and straightforward layout make organized tours largely unnecessary. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer convenience for day trips to Oviedo or Covadonga, but for seeing Gijón itself, you'll do fine on your own. The essential experience—Chillida sculpture, old town, Roman baths, cider house, beach—takes 5-6 hours at a comfortable pace.</p>

            <h3>Elogio del Horizonte (Chillida Sculpture)</h3>
            <p>This is the must-see experience in Gijón. Eduardo Chillida's massive 1990 sculpture crowns the Cimadevilla headland, its curved concrete forms framing the Atlantic horizon. Free to visit, open always. The walk up takes 15-20 minutes from Plaza Mayor on cobblestones—bring sturdy shoes. The acoustic effects when wind passes through the sculpture are remarkable. Visit at different times if possible; the experience changes dramatically with light and weather. Sunset is magical. Allow 30-45 minutes to properly absorb the experience.</p>

            <h3>Cimadevilla Old Town</h3>
            <p>The ancient fisherman's quarter occupies the peninsula below the Chillida sculpture. Narrow lanes, colorful houses, hidden plazas, and centuries-old churches reward wandering without a fixed destination. The Palacio de Revillagigedo (€4 entry) houses contemporary art exhibitions in 18th-century baroque grandeur. Real residents still live here—you'll see laundry hanging from balconies, neighbors chatting in doorways. This is the soul of old Gijón. Allow 1-2 hours for exploring.</p>

            <h3>Termas Romanas (Roman Baths)</h3>
            <p>First-century Roman baths excavated beneath modern Gijón (€5 entry, €3 reduced). The underground museum reveals frigidarium, tepidarium, caldarium chambers and the ingenious hypocaust heating system. Informative displays explain Roman bathing culture. A remarkable connection to deep history in an unexpected location. Allow 45-60 minutes. Closed Mondays.</p>

            <h3>San Lorenzo Beach</h3>
            <p>Gijón's urban beach stretches 1.5 kilometers in a perfect golden arc. Blue Flag quality, though the Atlantic water stays brisk year-round. The beachfront promenade is ideal for walking, people-watching, and café-hopping. Surfers ride waves at the western end. Free to enjoy. The beach integrates seamlessly with city life—this is where Gijón relaxes.</p>

            <h3>Sidrería Experience</h3>
            <p>Asturian cider culture deserves dedicated time. Visit a traditional sidrería like Casa Trabanco or Tierra Astur (€15-25 for cider and tapas) to experience the escanciar pouring ritual. Servers pour from height, you drink the small portion immediately, repeat. Sawdust covers floors. The atmosphere is loud and convivial. Best experienced at lunch or early evening. <strong>Book ahead</strong> not required—walk in and claim a spot at the bar.</p>

            <h3>Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura</h3>
            <p>This enormous cultural complex (€5 tower access, exhibitions vary) occupies a massive 1950s-era building originally built as an orphanage. Now houses contemporary art, theaters, and science exhibitions. The architecture alone impresses—brutalist ambition on a staggering scale. The tower offers city panoramas. Bus 1 from Plaza Mayor (€1.40). Worth visiting if time permits and exhibitions interest you. Allow 2-3 hours including transit.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (EUR). ATMs widely available in the city center. Credit cards accepted at most restaurants and shops; smaller establishments and market vendors may prefer cash. Typical ATM withdrawal fee €3-5.</p>

            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Spanish (Castellano) and Asturian (Asturianu) are both spoken. English is less common than in major tourist cities—download a translation app and learn basic phrases. Locals respond warmly to efforts at Spanish.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Asturias earned its "Green Coast" name through frequent rain. Pack a light waterproof jacket even on sunny mornings. Locals say "Asturias has four seasons in one day"—and they're not exaggerating. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 25°C (77°F). The mild, maritime climate makes this coast refreshingly different from Mediterranean Spain.</p>

            <p><strong>Cider Etiquette:</strong> In sidrerías, drink your culín immediately after pouring—the fizz fades in seconds. Don't finish the last sip; leave a splash to rinse your glass by swirling and discarding onto the sawdust floor. This is tradition, not waste. Cider costs €3-5 per bottle, typically shared.</p>

            <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Roman baths close Mondays. Laboral hours vary; check before visiting. Sidrerías serve lunch 13:30-16:00 and dinner after 20:30—adjust to Spanish schedules. Sunday afternoons many shops close. Churches may close midday.</p>

            <p><strong>Local Specialties:</strong> Fabada Asturiana (white bean stew, €12-18), cachopo (breaded veal with ham and cheese, €15-20, often serves two), fresh seafood at marina restaurants (€20-35 per person). Cabrales blue cheese is local and excellent—try with honey.</p>

          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>Q: Is Gijón worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br />
            A: Absolutely. Gijón offers authentic Asturian culture without overwhelming crowds. The blend of Celtic heritage, Roman history, world-class sculpture, and genuine Spanish coastal life makes it one of northern Spain's most rewarding ports—particularly if you've experienced the Mediterranean cruise circuit before and want something different.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What is Elogio del Horizonte?</strong><br />
            A: Eduardo Chillida's 1990 concrete sculpture crowns the Cimadevilla headland. The massive curved forms frame the Atlantic horizon and create remarkable acoustic effects when wind passes through. It's become Gijón's symbol and is absolutely worth the climb—free to visit, open always, transformative at sunset.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do you pour Asturian cider?</strong><br />
            A: The technique is called escanciar. The server holds the bottle high overhead and pours a thin stream into a wide glass held at hip level. This aerates the flat cider, creating a brief fizz. You receive a small pour (culín) which you drink immediately before the fizz fades. Then repeat. It's part ritual, part theater, all Asturian tradition.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like?</strong><br />
            A: Maritime and changeable. This is Spain's "Green Coast"—it earns that verdant landscape through regular rain. Pack layers and a light waterproof jacket even in summer. Temperatures stay mild (rarely hot), fog is common, and conditions can shift within hours. The Celtic atmosphere makes this coast unique.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I walk from the cruise shuttle drop-off?</strong><br />
            A: Yes. From Plaza Mayor, everything worth seeing is walkable. San Lorenzo Beach: 10 minutes. Roman baths: 5 minutes. Chillida sculpture on Cimadevilla headland: 20-25 minutes including the climb. The city center is compact and pedestrian-friendly.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need in Gijón?</strong><br />
            A: A typical cruise day (6-8 hours) is perfect. Morning: Chillida sculpture and Cimadevilla old town. Lunch: sidrería experience. Afternoon: Roman baths, San Lorenzo Beach promenade. The city's walkable size works well for cruise visitors. If you have more time, add Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura.</p>
