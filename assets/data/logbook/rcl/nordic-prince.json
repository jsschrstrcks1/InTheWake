      "markdown": "**Nordic Prince launched on July 31, 1971 as Royal Caribbean's second ship.**\n\nShe wasn't the first. [Song of Norway](/ships/rcl/song-of-norway.html) (1970) pioneered the concept. But Nordic Prince proved it wasn't a fluke—that Royal Caribbean's vision of Scandinavian-modern design for Caribbean cruising could sustain a growing fleet.\n\nOn her maiden voyage, Nordic Prince departed Miami on the first 14-day cruise ever operated by Royal Caribbean: Nassau, San Juan, St. Thomas, Fort de France, Curaçao, La Guaira, Aruba, Montego Bay, Haiti. She pioneered the two-week Caribbean grand loop that would become a staple itinerary for decades.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Keel laid: July 9, 1970\n- Entered service: July 31, 1971\n- Original tonnage: 18,436 GT\n- Original capacity: 724 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Original length: 552 feet (168.3 meters)\n- Lengthened: June 1980 at Wärtsilä Helsinki (26-meter mid-section added)\n- Post-stretch: 23,149 GT, 1,194 passengers, 676 feet\n- Built by: Wärtsilä Koncernen AB, Helsinki, Finland\n- Signature feature: Viking Crown Lounge (signature glass observation lounge)\n- Retired from Royal Caribbean: 1995 (first of the original ships to be sold)\n- Subsequent names: Carousel, Aquamarine, Ocean Star Pacific\n- Final fate: Scrapped 2015, age 44\n\n**What made Nordic Prince significant:**\n\nShe validated the business model. Song of Norway proved the concept; Nordic Prince proved it could scale. When she was lengthened in 1980—the first Royal Caribbean ship to receive that treatment—she demonstrated that ships could be extended mid-life to increase capacity and profitability, a practice the industry would adopt widely.\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge on Nordic Prince was more refined than Song of Norway's prototype—accessible, welcoming, designed for extended time rather than quick visits. Passengers reported it as the gathering place after dinner: drinks, live music, dancing, panoramic Caribbean night views.\n\nNordic Prince pioneered the 14-day Caribbean itinerary that gave passengers time to genuinely unwind, not just sample ports. Two weeks at sea was luxury time—enough to disconnect from shore life, settle into ship rhythms, meet fellow passengers beyond polite greetings.",

      "markdown": "**Documented passenger memories (from cruise forums and historical records):**\n\n\"Our first cruise, 1973. Fourteen days. By day four we knew half the ship. By day fourteen we'd made friends we'd keep for years.\"\n\n\"The Viking Crown Lounge at sunset—watching the Caribbean turn gold and purple through floor-to-ceiling windows. You didn't want to be anywhere else.\"\n\n\"She wasn't flashy. Just clean, modern, comfortable. Scandinavian design before we knew what that meant.\"\n\n\"Formal nights felt genuinely elegant. The two-deck dining room, white-glove service, live orchestra. She made you feel like cruising was something special.\"\n\n\"After they lengthened her in 1980, she felt bigger but not crowded. Still intimate. You recognized faces.\"\n\n\"When Royal Caribbean sold her in 1995, it felt like losing an old friend. She was the first to go.\"\n\n**Historical context:**\n\nNordic Prince introduced hundreds of thousands of passengers to extended Caribbean cruising. Her 14-day itineraries allowed passengers to visit ports that shorter cruises couldn't reach—deeper into the Southern Caribbean, to islands most Americans had never heard of.\n\nShe was particularly beloved by retirees and honeymooners who had the time for two-week voyages. Many couples reported returning year after year, requesting the same stateroom, seeing the same crew members.\n\n**Industry legacy:**\n\nNordic Prince's 1980 lengthening pioneered the ship-stretching practice that would extend the careers of dozens of cruise ships throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The procedure—cutting the ship in half, inserting a prefabricated mid-section, reconnecting systems—became standard industry practice.\n\nWhen she was sold to Sun Cruises in 1995, the new owners removed her Viking Crown Lounge—a requirement from [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) to protect their signature design. The lounge was so identified with Royal Caribbean that losing it symbolized Nordic Prince's departure from the fleet.\n\nShe served another 20 years under various names and owners before finally being scrapped in 2015. Forty-four years from keel laying to breaking—a long life for a ship that helped prove cruising could be more than a niche industry.\n\n**In memoriam:**\n\nNordic Prince died so that [Voyager](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), and [Icon](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) could live. She validated the vision. She proved it could scale. She taught a generation what Caribbean cruising could be.",
