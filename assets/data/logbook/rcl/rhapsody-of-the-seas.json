It's been refurbished, but don't expect cutting-edge tech or newest venues. Cabins are smaller. Dining variety is limited. The pool deck is functional, not Instagram-worthy.\n\nBut if you want *cruising*\u2014not theme-parking at sea\u2014Rhapsody delivers. Attentive crew who remember your name. Traditional dining room with proper service. Manageable size where you can find the library, spa, or your cabin without a map. Glass-walled design for spectacular ocean views.\n\nRhapsody is the ship you choose when you understand what it's trying to be: a floating hotel for beautiful ports, designed for travelers who'd rather explore the Mediterranean than ride a surf simulator.\n\nSee [other Vision-class ships](/ships.html) for similar intimate experiences, or compare to [Radiance class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) for glass-wall design in a slightly larger package.",

      "markdown": "**Everyone talks about Alaska cruises like they're luxury-only. We did Alaska for $1,100 per person, all-in.**\n\nMy wife and I saved for three years for Alaska. We researched ships, read reviews, compared prices. The newer ships \u2014 [Ovation](/ships/rcl/ovation-of-the-seas.html), [Quantum](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) \u2014 were $2,500-3,000 per person for 7 nights. Beautiful ships, but out of our budget.\n\nRhapsody's Alaska sailing was $1,100. Same ports: Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Icy Strait Point. Same glaciers. Same whales. Same excursions.\n\nDifferent ship.\n\nRhapsody is Vision Class, built in 1997. Smaller (2,000 guests vs. 4,000 on newer ships). Fewer amenities (no robot bartenders or surf simulators). Older cabins. But here's what mattered in Alaska:\n\nThe scenery is outside the ship.\n\nWe spent maybe 2 hours per day in our cabin (sleeping). The rest of the time we were on deck watching glaciers calve, spotting whales, hiking in Juneau, riding the White Pass railway in Skagway. The ship was transportation and a bed. It didn't need to be cutting-edge.\n\nWhat Rhapsody did well:\n- **Viewing decks:** Plenty of outdoor space, never crowded, perfect for glacier watching\n- **Service:** Smaller ship meant crew remembered our names, preferences, stories\n- **[Main dining room](/ships/rcl/rhapsody-of-the-seas.html#dining-card):** Traditional dining, excellent food, attentive servers\n- **Glass elevators and Centrum:** Signature Vision Class design with panoramic views\n- **Port timing:** Same port calls as expensive ships, same shore excursion options\n\nWere the cabins tiny? Yes. Did we care? No. Was the pool deck packed on sunny days? Sometimes. Did that matter when we were watching humpback whales breach 50 feet from the ship? Not even a little.\n\nWe saved $1,400 per person by choosing Rhapsody over Ovation. Used that savings for excursions: helicopter glacier landing ($350), whale watching expedition ($180), salmon bake dinner ($80). Those experiences mattered infinitely more than having a robot bartender.\n\nAlaska is one of those destinations where the ship takes a backseat to the scenery. Save the money. Book the smaller ship. Spend the difference on experiences you'll actually remember.\n\nSee our [Alaska cruise guide](/ports.html) and [budget travel tips](/planning.html).",

      "core_insight": "Vision Class glass elevators and compact layout make navigation easier for those with limited mobility",
      "markdown": "**My mother is 78. She uses a walker. She was terrified of cruising.**\n\n\"Too big,\" she said when we suggested a family cruise. \"I'll get lost. I'll slow everyone down. I'll be stuck in the cabin.\"\n\nWe chose Rhapsody specifically because it's smaller and because of the glass elevators. Vision Class ships have this signature design: glass-walled elevators in the center atrium (the Centrum) that face outward as you ride. You can see where you're going. You can orient yourself.\n\nThat mattered more than we realized.\n\nMom could look out of the elevator and know where she was: \"Oh, that's the dining room level.\" \"That's where the shops are.\" \"That's our deck.\" The visual reference points gave her confidence. She wasn't trapped in a metal box wondering where she'd end up.\n\nThe ship's compact size helped too. Our cabin to the dining room: two-minute walk. Cabin to the Windjammer buffet: three minutes. Cabin to the pool deck: one elevator ride and a short walk. Mom could navigate independently without exhausting herself.\n\nThe crew noticed her walker day one and went out of their way to help. They'd hold elevator doors. They'd carry her tray at the buffet. They'd offer chairs in busy areas. Not in a pitying way \u2014 in a \"we see you and we've got you\" way.\n\nBy day three, Mom was walking to breakfast alone. By day five, she was joining the trivia contests in the Centrum. By the end of the cruise, she was staying up for the late-night shows.\n\n\"When are we booking the next one?\" she asked on disembarkation day.\n\nWe've sailed Rhapsody three times since. Different itineraries, same ship. Mom's 81 now. Still uses the walker. Still cruises confidently on Rhapsody.\n\n**Accessibility notes:** Royal Caribbean has accessible cabins with wider doors, roll-in showers, grab bars. Request them when booking. Smaller ships like Vision Class are easier to navigate than mega-ships. Glass elevators provide visual orientation that helps everyone, but especially those with cognitive or mobility concerns.\n\nSee our [accessible travel guide](/planning.html) and [senior cruising tips](/articles.html).",

      "title": "Park Cafe: The Hidden Gem of Vision Class",
      "persona_label": "Dining Discovery",
      "intended_reader": "Cruisers who tend to stick to main dining room and buffet",
      "core_insight": "Rhapsody's Park Cafe offers fresh, quality complimentary food that many guests overlook",
      "markdown": "**We didn't discover Park Cafe until day four. We'd been missing out.**\n\nMost people do the same thing on cruises: buffet for breakfast and lunch, main dining room for dinner. Maybe hit the pizza place late night. Repeat for seven days.\n\nWe were doing exactly that on Rhapsody until a crew member mentioned Park Cafe. \"It's near the Solarium,\" she said. \"You should try it for lunch.\"\n\nWe almost didn't. The buffet was fine. Why complicate things?\n\nDay four, we gave it a shot.\n\nPark Cafe is small \u2014 maybe 30 seats \u2014 tucked near the adults-only Solarium pool. The menu changes daily but focuses on fresh-made sandwiches, paninis, salads, and soups. Everything is made to order, not sitting under heat lamps.\n\nI got a caprese panini: fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic reduction, grilled on ciabatta. It was *good*. Not \"good for a cruise\" \u2014 just good. Better than most cafes on land.\n\nMy wife got a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken, feta, olives, and a lemon vinaigrette that actually tasted like lemons, not bottled dressing.\n\nWe sat outside by the Solarium pool (quiet, adults-only, peaceful) and ate real food in the sunshine while half the ship was crammed into the Windjammer buffet.\n\nWe went back every day for the rest of the cruise. Tried the Cuban sandwich (excellent). The tomato soup with grilled cheese (comfort food perfection). The Greek wrap (fresh, tangy, satisfying).\n\nHere's the secret: Park Cafe is complimentary. No extra charge. Same as the buffet or pizza place. But it's tucked away enough that most guests don't know it exists or don't bother trying it.\n\nTheir loss.\n\n**Why it works:** Small space means limited capacity, which means they can focus on quality. Made-to-order means fresh. Near the Solarium means quieter atmosphere. It's everything the buffet isn't: calm, fresh, personal.\n\nNot every Royal Caribbean ship has Park Cafe \u2014 it started on [Oasis Class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) and has been added to select ships including Rhapsody. If your ship has it, skip the buffet mob scene and try the cafe instead.\n\nSee our [complimentary dining guide](/restaurants.html) for more hidden gems.",
