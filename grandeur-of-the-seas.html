    <!-- WHY BOOK (merged copy) -->
    <section class="card" aria-labelledby="whyHeading">
      <h2 id="whyHeading">Why book Grandeur of the Seas?</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine drifting into a world where every sunrise promises a fresh adventure, and the ocean’s rhythm syncs perfectly with your own. That’s the quiet magic of <em>Grandeur of the Seas</em>, Royal Caribbean’s intimate Vision-class favorite—classic in character, vibrant in feel, and effortless to navigate. You’re never far from an ocean view, a live band, or a sincere hello from crew who remember your name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families find easy together-time here: kids claim bragging rights on the <strong>Rock Climbing Wall</strong>, teens stake out the arcade, and everyone reconnects over poolside movies under the stars. Couples lean into slow sunsets and unhurried dinners—whether that’s a five-course splurge at <strong>Chef’s Table</strong> or a relaxing evening in the glass-covered <strong>Solarium</strong> with cocktails that match the mood. First-timers and solo travelers appreciate the ship’s approachable scale: it delivers big-ship entertainment without the “where am I?” moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dining spans the globe, from easy, fresh choices at <strong>Windjammer</strong> to sushi and small plates at <strong>Izumi</strong>, with the <strong>Main Dining Room</strong> anchoring each evening’s ritual. After dinner, the curtain rises on productions like <em>Broadway Rhythm &amp; Rhyme</em>, while lounges buzz with comedians, game shows, and live music. It’s the sweet spot Royal does so well—daytime energy and nighttime unwind—crafted for travelers who want value without compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Itineraries from Tampa keep things sunny and simple: Western Caribbean days in Cozumel or Roatán, relaxed Bahamas escapes, and sea days designed for recharging. In an era of headline-grabbing mega-ships, <em>Grandeur</em> proves that smaller can mean richer—less walking, more doing, and genuine moments with crew who turn a good trip into a keeper.

      <h2 id="logbookHeading">A note from Ken’s Logbook — a personal review</h2>
      <p>
        We sailed <em>Grandeur of the Seas</em> in an ocean-view stateroom—bright - with views of epic sunrises; a great way to start each morning. Dining was a highlight: <strong>Chops Grille</strong> delivered a fantastic filet, and the <strong>Main Dining Room</strong> impressed with thoughtful pacing and spot-on recommendations. Service all around was warm and proactive: Miguel (Philippines) at Chops provided truly excellent, personable care; at Guest Services, Vincent D’Cruz resolved our requests quickly and professionally; and in <strong>Windjammer</strong>, Vergel noticed a morning pattern and brought fresh eggs to our table before we asked—a small kindness that says a lot about this crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tried <strong>Taste of Royal</strong>: the tuna tartare was tasty; shrimp could have used a touch more heat; the fried cheesecake stole the show. (Pro tip: the Saint Peter’s spritzer really pops if you squeeze the orange wedge.) Our Eastern Caribbean itinerary hit Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire. We snorkeled in Aruba (hello, flamingos), toured the Curaçao distillery and a sun-warmed cave, and in Bonaire took a quick taxi to <a href="https://buddydive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddy Dive Center</a>—great value rentals (as of Nov 2024), clear water, and a drop-off reef that rewards confident snorkelers and divers. Labadee beach time was still fun despite weather nixing our planned dive excursion. So we took in the Local Artists - who can be VERY assertive; a firm “no, thanks” works in at least three languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embark and debark in Fort Lauderdale were smooth, though port driving/parking can be confusing and pricey—off-port parking plus a taxi often beats the on-site rates. In the evenings, we caught <em>Broadway Rhythm &amp; Rhyme</em> and <em>Tango Buenos Aires</em>—the latter stood out with world-class dancing and vocals. Bottom line: <em>Grandeur</em> delivers that extra dose of personal connection big ships can’t replicate, backed by classic Royal fun and friendly, attentive service.
