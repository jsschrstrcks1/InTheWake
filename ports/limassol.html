        <h1>Limassol: Where Kings Married and Empires Fell</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Cyprus sits at the intersection of three continents, and Limassol remembers every empire that passed through. Greeks founded city-states here. Romans built amphitheaters that still echo with ancient dramas. Byzantine Christians erected basilicas. Crusader knights married queens in medieval chapels. The British left behind roundabouts and afternoon tea culture. And somewhere offshore, according to legend, Aphrodite rose from the sea foam in a shell — the goddess of love choosing this island as her birthplace. Standing in the amphitheater at Kourion, looking out over the Mediterranean, I understood why everyone wanted this place. Beauty attracts conquest.</p>

          <p>Limassol itself is Cyprus's second-largest city, a working port where cruise ships share the harbor with cargo vessels. The New Port operated by DP World is modern and efficient, about 4 km from the Old Town where medieval history concentrates into cobblestone streets. The city has reinvented itself as a resort destination, but step inside Limassol Castle and you're standing where Richard the Lionheart married Berengaria of Navarre in 1191 during the Third Crusade. The chapel is small, stone-walled, lit by narrow windows. You can almost hear the vows echoing off ancient walls — a king marrying a queen between battles, pausing war for love.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting in the amphitheater at Kourion Archaeological Site, watching a local theater troupe rehearse a Greek tragedy in the same space where actors performed 2,200 years ago. The acoustics are perfect — every whispered line carries to the top row. The Mediterranean stretches blue and infinite behind the stage. For a moment, time collapses. Ancient Greeks understood something about beauty and permanence that we've forgotten in our world of temporary structures and disposable entertainment. This theater was built to last forever, and it nearly has.
          </div>

          <p>The archaeological sites near Limassol aren't museum pieces behind glass — they're living spaces where you walk on Roman mosaics, climb temple steps worn smooth by Bronze Age pilgrims, and stand in amphitheaters that still host performances. Kourion's mosaics in the House of Eustolios show fish and birds and geometric patterns with colors that survived seventeen centuries. The Temple of Apollo Hylates nearby was a religious center when Moses was leading Israelites through deserts. History here isn't abstract — it's stone and mosaic and column foundations you can touch with your hands.</p>

Column foundations, priests' quarters, sacred baths visible. Peaceful setting among pine trees. Combined ticket with Kourion available. Allow 1 hour. The spiritual center of ancient Cyprus — atmosphere still reverent.</p>

Beach access nearby — combine archaeology with swimming.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kolossi Medieval Castle</h4>
          <p>Crusader stronghold 15 minutes west of Limassol — Knights of St. John headquarters in 14th-15th centuries.

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Shuttle Buses:</strong> Cruise lines often provide shuttles from New Port to Old Town. Check with ship for schedules and pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port; expect €15 to Old Town (10 min). Agree on fare before departure. Day hire for archaeological sites ~€100-150.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Bus:</strong> Bus route from port to city center €2 — economical but infrequent (check schedules). Not practical for archaeological sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available at port and in city (~€40-60/day). Best option for exploring Kourion, Kolossi, Amathus independently. Drive on left. Roads excellent.</li>
            <li><strong>Shore Excursions:</strong> Organized tours to Kourion/Apollo Temple or Paphos available through cruise line. Pre-booking recommended for guaranteed return.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Halloumi Cheese:</strong> Cyprus's signature squeaky cheese — grilled until golden, served warm. Made from sheep and goat milk. Salty, firm texture. Try it fresh from local producers.</li>
            <li><strong>Meze:</strong> Traditional Cypriot meal of many small dishes — hummus, tahini, olives, grilled vegetables, sausages, seafood, meat. Order for two to share. Allow 2+ hours for full experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Commandaria Wine:</strong> World's oldest named wine still in production (since 800 BC). Sweet dessert wine from sun-dried grapes. Crusader knights exported it across Europe. Kolossi Castle was production center.</li>
            <li><strong>Souvlaki:</strong> Grilled meat skewers (pork, chicken, lamb) in pita with tomato, onion, tzatziki. Fast, delicious, everywhere. Street food perfection.</li>
            <li><strong>Kleftiko:</strong> Slow-roasted lamb cooked for hours in sealed clay oven — falls off bone, intensely flavorful. Traditional shepherd's dish. Restaurant specialty.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Grilled octopus, calamari, sea bass, bream — Mediterranean catches prepared simply with lemon and olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cypriot Coffee:</strong> Similar to Greek/Turkish coffee — strong, thick, sweet. Served in small cups. Let grounds settle before drinking.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Kourion gets very hot midday — visit early morning or late afternoon. Bring hat, sunscreen, water. Limited shade among ruins.</li>
            <li>Combined archaeological ticket (Kourion + Apollo Temple + museum) saves money if visiting multiple sites. Available at first site entrance.</li>
            <li>Limassol Castle is small — 45 minutes sufficient for museum unless you read every placard. Air-conditioned refuge from heat.</li>
            <li>Commandaria wine from Kolossi area makes excellent souvenir — airport shops carry it, but better selection/prices in Limassol wine shops.</li>
            <li>Cyprus uses UK-style electrical plugs (Type G) — same as Britain. Bring adapter if needed for devices.</li>
            <li>Tap water safe to drink but heavily chlorinated. Bottled water widely available and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>If visiting Nicosia (Europe's last divided capital), allow full day — 1 hour drive each way plus border crossing time at Green Line.</li>
            <li>Meze portions are generous — one full meze often feeds two people comfortably. Ask waiter about portion sizes.</li>
            <li>Archaeological sites close earlier in winter (Nov-Mar) — verify hours before planning afternoon visits.</li>
          </ul>
