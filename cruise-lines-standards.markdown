# In The Wake Cruise Lines Standards (Sub-Document v2.233)

This sub-document defines rules for pages in /cruise-lines/ (e.g., /cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html). It is part of the modular "In The Wake Standards v2.233" and must be used with the [Main Standards](/standards/main-standards.md) for global rules (e.g., absolute URLs, versioning).

## Cruise Lines Page Structure
- **Scope**: /cruise-lines/ pages only.
- Include marketing blurbs (e.g., /data/royal_caribbean_brand_marketing_blurb.docx).
- Crosslink to ship pages in /ships/<line>/.
- Apply global rules (e.g., absolute URLs, SEO meta) from main standards.
