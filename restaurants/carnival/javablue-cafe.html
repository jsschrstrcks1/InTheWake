      <h3>JavaBlue Café Review: Carnival's Coffee and Pastry Stop</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> JavaBlue Café is Carnival's specialty coffee bar — the place you go when the complimentary drip coffee in the Lido isn't cutting it. Espresso drinks, lattes, smoothies, and a pastry case with cakes and cookies. Drinks are à la carte ($3-7 per drink) and not included in the Cheers! beverage package on most items, though policy has shifted — check your specific sailing.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The flat white is the best espresso drink — properly textured milk, decent crema, a legitimate coffee-shop experience. The mocha is indulgent and popular with the sweet-tooth crowd. The iced caramel latte is the go-to on port days when you want something cold. Smoothies are blended fresh and decent for a cruise ship. The pastry case has croissants, muffins, and individual cakes — the chocolate lava cake is the winner; the muffins are standard. Where it stumbles: the drip coffee (which is complimentary elsewhere on the ship) costs money here, which feels nickel-and-dime-y. And the espresso quality varies by barista — some pull excellent shots, others are still learning. The chai latte is overly sweet and tastes like syrup rather than actual chai.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Counter service — order, pay (or swipe your Sail &amp; Sign card), wait for your drink. Baristas are generally friendly and will customize (extra shot, oat milk if available, less syrup). Morning lines (7-9 a.m.) can be 5-10 minutes long on sea days. Mid-afternoon (2-4 p.m.) is the quietest window.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Clean, modern coffee-shop aesthetic with a few bistro tables and stools. It's a small space — not designed for lingering, more for grab-and-go. On some ships it's positioned near the atrium, which adds people-watching value. On others it's near the photo gallery, which is quieter. Either way, it's a pleasant 10-minute stop, not a destination.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.6/5.</strong> JavaBlue is a solid cruise-ship coffee bar — the flat white and iced caramel latte are genuinely good, and the chocolate lava cake is a nice pairing. It loses ground for the barista inconsistency, the overly sweet chai, and the feeling that you're paying $5-7 for something that should arguably be included in a beverage package. Still, for caffeine addicts who need real espresso at sea, it's the only option. <em>Tip:</em> order the flat white, skip the chai, and go at 2 p.m. to avoid the morning rush.</p>
