The R Class represents what Oceania meant before Marina and Allura Class expansion.\n\nThe intimate scale creates atmosphere impossible on larger ships. At 684 guests, community forms naturally. Crew recognize faces. Fellow passengers become familiar. The ship feels like traveling with acquaintances rather than strangers.\n\nNautica regularly refreshes through refurbishment—the ship looks current while maintaining classic R Class proportions and atmosphere.\n\nFor R Class loyalists: Nautica delivers the proven intimate formula. The larger ships may offer more, but the R Class provides something different—genuine intimacy that size enables.",

      "markdown": "**Nautica's deployment flexibility takes her from Alaska glaciers to Pacific islands—R Class intimacy in diverse environments.**\n\nAlaska deployments showcase the R Class advantage. At 684 guests, Nautica accesses ports that larger ships overwhelm. Smaller Southeast Alaska harbors welcome this scale. Wildlife viewing improves with fewer passengers competing for deck space.\n\nPacific and Asian itineraries demonstrate similar flexibility. Ports that cannot handle mega-ships welcome Nautica comfortably. The intimate scale becomes destination access advantage.\n\nOceania understands that R Class ships enable itineraries impossible for larger vessels. The deployment strategy deliberately places Nautica where her size serves destinations best.\n\nCulinary excellence travels regardless of destination. Whether in Alaska or Asia, the dining quality persists. Oceania's standards don't vary by region.\n\nFor adventure priorities: Nautica reaches places larger ships cannot. The intimate scale isn't limitation—it's opportunity for destinations that reward smaller-ship access.",

      "markdown": "**R Class ships have decades of service—but regular refurbishment keeps Nautica fresh rather than tired.**\n\nOceania invests in R Class refurbishment deliberately. The company understands that guests choosing intimate ships accept trade-offs but expect quality. Nautica's public spaces, staterooms, and dining venues reflect ongoing care.\n\nThe ship feels classic rather than outdated. Design choices honor the vessel's character while updating materials, furnishings, and technology. The atmosphere reads as refined rather than neglected.\n\nCompared to larger, newer ships, some limitations persist. Staterooms run smaller. Venues are fewer. Technology generations behind. But R Class guests accept these trade-offs knowingly—they come for intimacy, not newness.\n\nFor condition concerns: Nautica demonstrates Oceania's commitment to R Class fleet. The refurbishment investment signals intent to maintain these vessels for guests who love them.",
