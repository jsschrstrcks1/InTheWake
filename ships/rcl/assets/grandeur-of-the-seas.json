      "markdown": "### Authored Entry\nI have personally sailed *Grandeur of the Seas* for nine nights. These reflections come from that voyage — written from experience aboard the vessel and held to our editorial standards.\n\n## Stateroom & Views\nWe sailed *Grandeur of the Seas* in an ocean-view stateroom — bright, with views of epic sunrises; a great way to start each morning.\n\n## Dining & Service\nDining was a highlight: **Chops Grille** delivered a fantastic filet, and the **Main Dining Room** impressed with thoughtful pacing and spot-on recommendations. Service all around was warm and proactive: Miguel (Philippines) at Chops provided truly excellent, personable care; at Guest Services, Vincent D’Cruz resolved our requests quickly and professionally; and in **Windjammer**, Vergel noticed a morning pattern and brought fresh eggs to our table before we asked — a small kindness that says a lot about this crew.\n\n## Taste of Royal\nWe tried **Taste of Royal**: the tuna tartare was tasty; shrimp could have used a touch more heat; the fried cheesecake stole the show. *(Pro tip: the Saint Peter’s spritzer really pops if you squeeze the orange wedge.)*\n\n## Itinerary & Shores\nOur Eastern Caribbean itinerary hit Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire. We snorkeled in Aruba (hello, flamingos), toured the Curaçao distillery and a sun-warmed cave, and in Bonaire took a quick taxi to **[Buddy Dive Center](https://buddydive.com/)** — great-value rentals (as of Nov 2024), clear water, and a drop-off reef that rewards confident snorkelers and divers. Labadee beach time was still fun despite weather nixing our planned dive excursion. Local artists can be **very** assertive; a firm “no, thanks” works in at least three languages.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nEmbark and debark in Fort Lauderdale were smooth, though port driving/parking can be confusing and pricey — off-port parking plus a taxi often beats the on-site rates.\n\n## Evenings & Shows\nWe caught *Broadway Rhythm & Rhyme* and *Tango Buenos Aires* — the latter stood out with world-class dancing and vocals.\n\n## Bottom Line\n*Grandeur* delivers that extra dose of personal connection big ships can’t replicate, backed by classic Royal fun and friendly, attentive service."
