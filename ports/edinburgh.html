        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The castle appeared through morning mist as our taxi climbed from Leith toward the Old Town—a dark silhouette on volcanic rock that seemed to grow directly from the earth, commanding the skyline as it has for a thousand years. My wife squeezed my hand, and I understood immediately why Scots speak of Edinburgh with such fierce pride. The city doesn't merely contain history; it breathes it. Every cobblestone on the Royal Mile has witnessed centuries of kings and reformers, philosophers and poets, and today it would witness two more pilgrims drawn to Scotland's ancient heart.</p>

            <p>We began at the castle itself, purchasing tickets we'd wisely booked online the night before after reading how long the queues could grow on cruise days. The queue for walk-up tickets stretched down the esplanade, hundreds of visitors shuffling slowly forward while we walked past them, feeling perhaps a touch smug about our planning. The timed entry took us straight through the portcullis into a medieval world. The Honours of Scotland—crown, scepter, and sword of state—gleamed behind glass in the Crown Room, older than the English Crown Jewels and hidden during Cromwell's occupation in ways that still spark debate among historians. I stood before the Stone of Destiny, the coronation stone upon which Scottish kings were crowned for centuries before Edward I stole it and kept it in Westminster Abbey for seven hundred years. Its return to Scotland in 1996 still moves Scots to tears. The stone is just sandstone, yet it felt heavier than geology could explain.</p>

            <p>However, St. Margaret's Chapel changed everything. This tiny stone building—barely large enough for a dozen people—is the oldest surviving structure in Edinburgh, built in the 1130s by King David I to honor his mother. Light filtered through stained glass depicting Scotland's patron saints. An elderly woman sat quietly in the corner, rosary in weathered hands, lips moving in silent prayer. Nine centuries of devotion in that small space, and my heart swelled unexpectedly. I'm not particularly religious, yet I found myself sitting on the worn wooden bench, listening to the silence, feeling the weight of all those prayers pressing down through time. Tears came without warning. My wife found me there minutes later, touched my shoulder, and said nothing. Some moments don't require words.</p>

            <p>We walked the Royal Mile downhill, stopping at St. Giles' Cathedral where John Knox thundered reformation from the pulpit, forever changing Scottish Christianity. The smell of hops drifted from a nearby pub, mixing with the scent of fresh shortbread from a bakery doorway. Street performers played bagpipes on corners, the distinctive drone echoing off ancient stone walls. We descended into the Real Mary King's Close, where guides led us through preserved 17th-century streets literally buried beneath the modern city—rooms where plague victims died, where merchants haggled, where ordinary people lived lives now frozen in archaeological time. The air underground was cool and close, carrying the faint mustiness of centuries.</p>

            <p>Lunch at a whisky bar in Grassmarket introduced us to single malts we'd never encountered—Islay peat and Highland honey, Speyside sweetness and Lowland lightness. The bartender explained each dram with the passion of a sommelier, describing the water sources and cask treatments as if discussing old friends. At £8-15 per pour, this was education, not indulgence. I learned more about Scotch in that hour than in years of casual drinking, grateful for the privilege of tasting spirits where they were born.</p>

            <p>The afternoon found us at the free National Museum, where Dolly the sheep (the first cloned mammal) stands preserved alongside ancient Pictish stones carved with mysterious symbols that scholars still debate. The juxtaposition felt perfectly Edinburgh—cutting-edge science alongside Bronze Age mystery, all housed in a Victorian building of sweeping galleries and natural light. My wife lingered over Lewis Chessmen, those walrus ivory figures found on a Scottish beach in 1831, their expressions as alive as the day some medieval craftsman carved them. I found myself in the geology section, touching samples of Edinburgh's volcanic rock, understanding viscerally how the city grew from the earth itself. We could have spent days there. We had hours. But even hours revealed a nation's story told through objects both humble and magnificent, each one carrying the weight of someone's hands, someone's dreams, someone's ordinary extraordinary life frozen in time.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Sitting in St. Margaret's Chapel with tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by nine centuries of prayers in that tiny stone room. Looking back, Edinburgh taught me that some places hold more than architecture—they hold accumulated devotion, accumulated hope, accumulated meaning that transcends what eyes can see. I felt blessed to witness it, thankful that this city opened itself to us, even for a day.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Edinburgh has no dedicated cruise terminal—ships dock at several working ports serving the city. Most cruise lines use Leith, Edinburgh's historic port district 2 miles north of the Royal Mile. Some ships dock at South Queensferry beneath the iconic Forth Bridge, 10 miles west. Occasionally ships use Rosyth naval base across the Firth of Forth. Your ship will confirm docking location; transport arrangements vary accordingly.</p>

            <p>Leith offers the most convenient access—taxis to the Royal Mile cost approximately £10-15 ($12-18 USD), buses run frequently from Leith Walk, and most cruise lines provide shuttle buses ($15-20 round trip). South Queensferry requires longer transport (25-30 minutes to city center) but offers spectacular views of the Forth Bridge. Currency is British Pounds; cards are accepted nearly everywhere, though carrying some cash for street vendors and tips is advisable.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate to high.</strong> Edinburgh is hilly—the Royal Mile descends 300 feet from castle to Holyrood, and the Old Town involves significant climbing on cobblestones. Edinburgh Castle requires substantial stair climbing within the complex. The New Town is flatter but still involves hills. Comfortable walking shoes essential; heels impractical. Wheelchair users face challenges on cobblestones; some attractions offer accessible routes. Castle has limited accessibility—inquire in advance. Hop-on/hop-off buses provide rest between walking segments.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Shuttle buses:</strong> Most cruise lines offer shuttles from Leith to the Royal Mile ($15-20 round trip). From South Queensferry, ship shuttles are often the most practical option given the distance. Confirm drop-off/pickup locations and timing with your ship. <strong>Book ahead</strong> if spaces are limited, especially on large ships.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at all docking locations. From Leith to Royal Mile approximately £10-15 ($12-18 USD); from South Queensferry approximately £25-35 ($30-42 USD). Licensed black cabs can be hailed on the street. Uber operates in Edinburgh. For return trips, taxi ranks exist near major attractions, or pre-book through hotel concierges. Taxis handle luggage easily if you're exploring before rejoining the ship.</p>

            <p><strong>Public buses:</strong> Lothian Buses serve Leith extensively. Bus 22 runs from Leith to the Royal Mile. Single fares approximately £2 ($2.50 USD); day passes £4.50 ($5.50 USD). Exact change required or use contactless payment. Buses are reliable and frequent but can be crowded during peak hours.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The most rewarding way to experience Edinburgh once you reach the Old Town. The Royal Mile is 1.13 miles—allow 2-3 hours with stops. Wear comfortable shoes; cobblestones are uneven and can be slippery when wet. Walking from Leith to the Royal Mile (2 miles) is possible but involves uphill climbing. Stick to the Old Town for manageable cruise-day exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Hop-on/hop-off buses:</strong> Multiple operators run circuits past major attractions. Tickets approximately £18-22 ($22-27 USD) for 24 hours. Useful for rest between walking segments and covering ground efficiently. <strong>Book ahead</strong> online for small discounts. Audio commentary provides orientation to the city.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Edinburgh's Old Town presents significant challenges—cobblestones, steep hills, and historic buildings with limited modifications. Edinburgh Castle has an accessible route to the main attractions but requires advance arrangement. The National Museum is fully accessible. New Town is flatter and easier to navigate. Many tour buses have low-floor access. Contact attractions directly for specific accessibility information.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Edinburgh rewards both structured tours and independent exploration. A typical cruise call (8-10 hours) allows for Castle visit, Royal Mile exploration, and one or two additional attractions. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($80-150) provide <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and handle transport logistics. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration offers flexibility and often better value, especially from Leith. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Edinburgh Castle timed entry—queues can exceed an hour during peak season.</p>

            <h3>Edinburgh Castle</h3>
            <p>Scotland's most visited attraction, dominating the skyline from volcanic rock since the 12th century.

            <h3>Real Mary King's Close</h3>
            <p>Guided tours descend beneath the Royal Mile into preserved 17th-century streets buried when the City Chambers were built above.

            <h3>Holyrood Palace</h3>
            <p>Official Scottish residence of the British monarch at the foot of the Royal Mile. Mary Queen of Scots lived here; see her chambers and the room where her secretary was murdered before her eyes. Adjacent ruins of 12th-century Holyrood Abbey. Audio tour included. Tickets £18 adult ($22 USD). <strong>Book ahead</strong> during peak season. Allow 1.5-2 hours. Low to moderate stamina—some stairs. Mostly accessible; inquire in advance. Often combined with Royal Mile walk.</p>

            <h3>Arthur's Seat Hike</h3>
            <p>Volcanic peak (823 feet) in Holyrood Park offering panoramic views of Edinburgh, the Firth of Forth, and the Highlands on clear days. Multiple routes of varying difficulty; the main path from Holyrood takes 45-60 minutes each way. Free access. High stamina required—steep and rocky in places. Proper hiking shoes essential. Not accessible. Rewarding for fit visitors with time; skip if mobility is limited or weather poor. Views from base of Arthur's Seat are also impressive.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Castle Rock:</strong> The volcanic plug upon which Edinburgh Castle stands is 350 million years old—remnant of an ancient volcano eroded by glaciers that carved the distinctive "crag and tail" formation creating the ridge now called the Royal Mile. Humans have fortified this rock since at least the 2nd century AD. The current castle dates primarily from the 16th century, though St. Margaret's Chapel within its walls was built in the 1130s. The rock's strategic value made Edinburgh the obvious choice for Scotland's capital.</p>

            <p><strong>Whisky and Leith:</strong> Leith has been Edinburgh's port for centuries, and whisky made the district prosperous. By the 18th century, Leith's bonded warehouses aged Scotch before export to Europe and the world. The whisky trade built fortunes, funded wars, and spread Scottish culture globally. Today Leith has gentrified into restaurants and luxury flats, but the whisky connection remains—distilleries dot the surrounding countryside, and Edinburgh's whisky bars rank among the world's best.</p>

            <p><strong>The Scottish Enlightenment:</strong> Edinburgh in the 18th century became one of the world's intellectual capitals. David Hume, Adam Smith, and a constellation of philosophers, scientists, and thinkers made "Auld Reekie" a center of reason and inquiry. The New Town—built from 1767 as a planned Georgian district—housed these luminaries in elegant symmetry that contrasted with the medieval chaos of the Old Town. The city has never lost this intellectual character; Scottish universities remain world-renowned, and Edinburgh's Festival Fringe draws thinkers alongside performers each August.</p>

            <p><strong>Scottish independence:</strong> Scotland merged with England in 1707, surrendering its parliament in exchange for economic integration and debt relief. The independence question has never fully died. A devolved Scottish Parliament reconvened in 1999; the independence referendum of 2014 returned 45% "Yes" votes. Brexit has reignited debate—Scotland voted heavily to remain in the EU while England voted to leave. Visitors will encounter passionate views on all sides. Tread respectfully; this isn't abstract politics but deeply felt identity.</p>

              <summary>Is Edinburgh Castle worth visiting?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely—it's Scotland's most visited attraction for good reason. The Honours of Scotland (oldest British crown jewels), Stone of Destiny, St. Margaret's Chapel, and panoramic views justify the £19.50 ($24) admission.

              <summary>Can I walk the Royal Mile in a cruise day?</summary>
              <p>Yes—the Royal Mile is only 1.13 miles and is the heart of any Edinburgh visit. Allow 2-3 hours with stops at St. Giles' Cathedral, shops, and viewpoints. Combined with Edinburgh Castle, this makes a full but manageable day from Leith. Wear comfortable shoes; cobblestones are uneven.</p>

              <summary>Is Edinburgh accessible for wheelchair users?</summary>
              <p>Edinburgh's Old Town presents challenges—cobblestones, steep hills, and historic buildings with limited modifications. Edinburgh Castle has an accessible route (arrange in advance). The National Museum is fully accessible. The New Town is flatter. Contact specific attractions for detailed accessibility information before visiting.</p>

              <summary>What's the best whisky experience in Edinburgh?</summary>
              <p>The Scotch Whisky Experience on the Royal Mile offers a solid introduction (£19-32). For serious enthusiasts, Cadenhead's whisky shop (Royal Mile) stocks single-cask bottlings unavailable elsewhere. Whisky bars in Grassmarket and along the Royal Mile offer extensive tasting selections at £8-15 per dram.</p>

          <p class="author-note"><em>These soundings in another's wake reflect one family's experience. Edinburgh exceeded every expectation—ancient stones that truly speak, a castle that dominates in ways pictures cannot capture, and that tiny chapel where nine centuries of prayers reduced me to tears. Scotland's capital demands return visits. We will oblige.</em></p>
