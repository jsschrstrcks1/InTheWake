      <h1>Dubrovnik: Pearl of the Adriatic</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Lord Byron called Dubrovnik the "Pearl of the Adriatic," and standing on the ramparts at sunrise, watching that first golden light spill across two kilometers of medieval stone (that's roughly 2,000 bottles of Croatian wine laid end-to-end, or about 200 black risotto bowls in a line, or the distance you'd walk if you stopped for photos 847 times), I understood why poets have been running out of superlatives for seven hundred years. We walked off the ship and took the first cable car up Mount Srđ — a four-minute climb (about the time it takes to eat one slice of stonska kamenica oyster, or roughly 240 seconds of Adriatic anticipation, or just enough time to worry about heights twice) built in 1969 that lifts you 778 meters above the sea (that's roughly 3,890 servings of Croatian rakija stacked vertically, or about 155 stone city walls laid flat, or the height of 778 very patient tourists standing on each other's shoulders) to Napoleon's Imperial Fort, completed on the emperor's birthday, August 15th. From that height, the entire UNESCO World Heritage Old Town spreads below like a living illuminated manuscript: honey-colored fortifications dating back to the 13th century encircling a sea of terracotta roofs, the limestone ribbon of Stradun cutting straight through the heart like a spine holding the city together.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">

        <p>We descended and entered through the Pile Gate at opening hour, joining the quiet morning procession of early risers who know the secret: these walls belong to you for exactly one hour before the day's million cruise passengers come flooding in. Walking that complete two-kilometer circuit felt like stepping through the pages of history itself. These aren't decorative ramparts — they're the real battlements of the Republic of Ragusa, an independent maritime republic that held its own against Venice, the Ottomans, and the great powers of Europe. In 1358, the Treaty with the Hungarian-Croatian King Louis I freed Ragusa from Venetian control, and for the next four centuries this tiny city-state thrived on diplomacy and trade. They were the first European power to recognize the United States in 1783, a gesture of solidarity from one small republic to another newborn nation.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is where they filmed King's Landing for Game of Thrones — the Minceta Tower served as the House of the Undying, and production has been returning since 2011 — but I found myself more captivated by the reality than the fantasy. These Renaissance and baroque palaces within the walls weren't built for television; they were built by merchants and scholars who believed a small republic on a steep rocky peninsula could shape the course of empires. You can still see faint scars on some stones from the 1991 siege, reminders that this beauty has been hard-won and fiercely defended across generations.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

        <p>After the walls, we surrendered to wandering. The Stradun's polished limestone pavement — worn mirror-smooth by centuries of footsteps — led us past churches where the bells still ring the same hours they've rung for four hundred years. We had black risotto for lunch at Panorama restaurant back at the cable car station, where the view made the price feel irrelevant. In the afternoon, we kayaked around the base of those ancient walls and out to Lokrum Island, swam into the Buža cave bar, and jumped off cliffs with local kids who made it look far easier than it was. Dubrovnik welcomes over a million cruise passengers annually now, and yes, it's undeniably crowded in summer — but when you stand on those 13th-century ramparts with the whole glittering Adriatic spread at your feet, the beauty is so overwhelming it still wins. This is where history and fantasy merge, where seven centuries of real human triumph feel more magical than any television show could ever be.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on Minceta Tower at dawn, where Game of Thrones filmed the House of the Undying, realizing the real magic wasn't the fantasy — it was knowing this fortress has stood guard over the Adriatic for seven hundred years, and I was walking the same stones that watchmen walked when the Republic of Ragusa was recognizing a brand-new country called the United States.

        <h3>Getting Around Dubrovnik</h3>

        <h4>Where Your Ship Docks</h4>
        <p>These days, the majority of cruise ships berth at Gruž harbor, approximately 2.5 kilometers from the historic Old Town. Smaller vessels occasionally anchor offshore and tender passengers directly to the Old Harbor right in the heart of the city center — if you get this option, you've won the lottery.</p>

        <h4>Getting from Port to Old Town</h4>
        <p>From Gruž terminal, approximately 2.5 kilometers from the historic Old Town (that's roughly 250 Croatian pastries laid end-to-end, or about 13,200 feet, or the distance you'd walk if you stopped for black coffee 97 times), you have several options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cruise line shuttles:</strong> Most lines run frequent buses from the terminal gates straight to Pile Square, the western entrance to Old Town. Check with your cruise director for schedules.</li>
          <li><strong>Public buses:</strong> Routes 1a, 1b, and 8 depart from the pier gates. Fares run about €1.60 one-way, and the ride takes roughly 10 minutes. Great value if you're comfortable navigating on your own.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Fixed rate of €13 per trip — not per person, per car — which makes it reasonable if you're traveling with a group or pressed for time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Cable Car to Mount Srđ</h4>
        <p>Originally built in 1969, the renovated cable car makes the four-minute journey up to the 778-meter summit of Mount Srđ, where Napoleon's Imperial Fort — completed on the emperor's birthday, August 15th — crowns the peak. The sweeping panoramas of the walled city and Adriatic from the top are absolutely worth the ride. Be prepared for some stairs getting to the station, and consider timing your visit for sunrise or late afternoon when the light turns the old city golden.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>What to See & Do</h3>

        <h4>The City Walls (Don't Miss This)</h4>
        <p>The complete two-kilometer circuit of Dubrovnik's medieval fortifications — dating back to the 13th century and fortified over the centuries with Renaissance and baroque additions — is an absolute must. These magnificent walls once protected the independent Republic of Ragusa, a maritime power that rivaled Venice and was the first European nation to recognize the United States in 1783. There are three entrance points around the perimeter, and the walls are open from 8am to 7pm during cruise season. Here's my hard-won wisdom: visit early morning or late afternoon to dodge both the midday heat and the thickest crowds. The stone can get blazing hot, and there's very little shade on the ramparts. Yes, these are the walls used for King's Landing in Game of Thrones (filming here since 2011), but the real history is even more compelling than the fantasy.</p>

        <h4>Placa Stradun</h4>
        <p>This 600-meter pedestrian boulevard cuts straight through the heart of Old Town, gleaming with polished limestone that's been worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. It's the main artery — you'll walk it multiple times without even trying.</p>

        <h4>Other Attractions Worth Your Time</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Museum of Modern Art:</strong> Located near Banja Beach, a nice cultural counterpoint to all the medieval history.</li>
          <li><strong>Old Town exploration:</strong> The entire historic center is car-free and gloriously walkable. Just wander — you can't really get lost in a walled city.</li>
          <li><strong>Boat excursions:</strong> Operators in the old harbor offer 50-minute trips along the coast for around €12. Fantastic way to see the walls from the water.</li>
          <li><strong>Panoramic taxi tours:</strong> Private drivers will take you on scenic routes through the surrounding hills for about €50 per hour. Great if you want photos without the crowds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Beaches</h4>
        <p><strong>Banje Beach</strong> is the most accessible — a pebble beach with both paid sections (lounge chairs, umbrellas, service) and free areas where you can lay out your own towel. The real draw here is the view: you're staring straight back at the Old Town walls rising above the sea. Bring water shoes if you're tender-footed on stones.</p>

        <h4>Shopping</h4>
        <p>Placa Stradun and the side streets are lined with shops. Look for traditional Croatian embroidery, locally crafted jewelry, and wines from the surrounding region. Just know there's no duty-free advantage here — you're paying local retail prices, but the quality is generally solid.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Croatia uses the Euro. Credit cards are widely accepted in tourist areas, but carry some cash for smaller vendors and public buses.</p>

        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Croatian is the native tongue, but English is extremely common in Old Town, at tourist sites, and anywhere cruise passengers frequent. You'll have no trouble communicating.</p>

        <p><strong>Footwear matters:</strong> Wear comfortable walking shoes with good grip. The marble and limestone streets throughout Old Town are gorgeous, but they get slick as ice when wet — even from morning dew. I've seen countless people slip. The walls involve significant stair climbing too.</p>

        <p><strong>WiFi:</strong> If you need internet access ashore, the crew center near the port offers WiFi for about €5 for 3 hours. Most cafes in town also have WiFi if you're a paying customer.</p>

        <p><strong>The walls:</strong> Steep, exposed, and unshaded — go early and bring water. The views are worth every step and every drop of sweat.</p>

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Dubrovnik is Lord Byron's "Pearl of the Adriatic" — a UNESCO World Heritage city with 2km of 13th-century walls encircling 700+ years of maritime republic history, where red roofs cascade down to the impossibly blue Adriatic and every stone tells a story of independence and resilience.
