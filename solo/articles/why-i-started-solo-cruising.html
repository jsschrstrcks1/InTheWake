  <h1>Why I Started Solo Cruising (and Built a Community)</h1>
  <p class="dek">From that first solo gangway to a thriving community — lessons, safety, and the unexpected joy of sailing on your own terms.</p>

  <p>I booked my first solo cruise because I was tired of waiting for everyone else’s schedule. I stayed for the freedom — coffee at sunrise, new friends by lunch, and a quiet deck chair when I needed to breathe.</p>

  <p class="pill disclosure"><strong>Author’s note:</strong> These are lessons from real sailings and real meetups — what worked, what didn’t, and what I tell every first-timer who messages the group.</p>

  <h2>Why I Went Solo</h2>
  <p>I wanted a reset — a trip that didn’t hinge on anyone else’s calendar. Onboard, I found something more: a community of people who weren’t afraid to try new things, and a rhythm I could set for myself.</p>

  <h2>What I Wish I’d Known</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Go to the solo meetup on day one.</strong> Friendships form fast.</li>
    <li><strong>Ship excursions are worth it in certain ports.</strong> The ship will wait for them.</li>
    <li><strong>Pack light but smart.</strong> <a href="https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/packing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s a list I use</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety, Belonging, and Joy</h2>
  <p>I learned I could be both independent and connected. Morning journaling on the balcony; dinner with new friends; a show, or early lights out. Solo doesn’t mean alone — it means you get to choose.</p>
