      <h1>Bermuda: My Pink Sand Paradise</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>The ship docks inside a fortress — actual 19th-century stone walls and cannons everywhere. The Dockyard has great museums and shops, but we hopped the ferry to Hamilton first for pastel buildings and Front Street vibes, then public bus #7 straight to Horseshoe Bay.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">

        <p>Nothing prepares you for that first sight of the beach — the sand is actually pink (crushed shells + coral), and the water is the color of a Tiffany box. We tucked ourselves into a cove between limestone rocks and spent hours floating in bath-warm water so clear we watched baby sergeant major fish nibble algae off our fingers.</p>

        <p>Afternoon rum swizzle at Swizzle Inn (yes, "Swizzle Inn, swagger out") — Bermuda's dangerously drinkable rum, dark rum, Gosling's Black Seal ginger beer, fruit juices. Paired with shark hash — minced shark meat on toast — sounds weird, tastes amazing.</p>

        <p>We took the ferry back at golden hour; the Great Sound looked like liquid gold with sailboats racing.</p>

        <p>The pros: the cleanest, safest, and most polite island I've ever visited.</p>
        <p>The cons: expensive (but absolutely worth it).</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Lying on my stomach on that pink sand so fine it squeaked underfoot, watching a Bermuda longtail bird dive straight into the water like an arrow for fish.

        <h3>The Cruise Port: Royal Naval Dockyard</h3>
        <p>Your vessel arrives at King's Wharf, positioned at the island's western end within what was once the British Royal Navy's most significant naval facility beyond the United Kingdom. The historic dockyard has been reimagined as a vibrant tourist hub while retaining its 19th-century fortifications and military architecture.</p>

        <p>Walking these limestone ramparts, I couldn't shake the weight of history beneath my feet. After Britain lost the American colonies in 1783, they needed a secure naval base between Halifax and the West Indies — somewhere to project power across the Atlantic. Construction began in 1795, largely by enslaved laborers and convicts who carved this fortress from solid coral rock. For more than a century and a half, the Royal Navy called this place the "Gibraltar of the West," their strategic anchor in the western Atlantic.</p>

        <p>The most sobering moment came when I learned what happened here during the War of 1812. In August 1814, over 5,000 British troops deployed from this very dockyard, sailed north, and laid siege to Washington D.C. and Baltimore. I stood at the wharf imagining those warships departing these same stone berths — and realized that somewhere out there on the water, Francis Scott Key was held captive aboard a ship from this fleet when he penned "The Star Spangled Banner." History wasn't just taught here; it was launched from these docks.</p>

        <p>The Royal Navy finally departed in 1951, and the facility officially closed in 1995. Today, the port features two adjacent berthing facilities — King's Wharf and the newer Heritage Wharf (opened in 2009 and renovated in 2023) — both offering immediate access to shops, dining establishments, the National Museum of Bermuda, and the ferry terminal. Step off your ship and you're already inside one of Bermuda's premier attractions, with restaurants, retail stores, and historical exhibits within walking distance of your gangway. The cruise season typically runs from April through mid-November, when ships dock right against the old fortress walls.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Bermuda's Famous Pink Sand Beaches</h3>
        <p>The island's signature beaches owe their distinctive rosy hue to crushed shells of tiny red sea creatures called foraminifera — single-celled organisms with bright pink or red shells that live beneath coral reefs. When these microscopic shells break down and mix with white quartz sand and coral fragments, they create those famous shades ranging from pale blush to deep salmon depending on the light. I scooped up a handful and studied it closely; you can actually see the individual pink grains mixed throughout.</p>

        <p><strong>Horseshoe Bay Beach</strong> stands as the most celebrated stretch of shoreline, consistently appearing on international "best beaches" rankings. Located in Southampton Parish, this south shore gem offers stunning soft pink sand against brilliant turquoise waters, dramatic limestone rock formations creating natural sheltered areas, and full amenities including chair and umbrella rentals, snorkel equipment, and boogie boards. It's the most photographed beach in Bermuda for good reason — that combination of pink sand and aquamarine water looks almost unreal.</p>
        <p>The beach sits approximately 35 minutes from the Dockyard via public bus, or you can book a shuttle service for around $16 per person. The journey itself showcases Bermuda's pastel cottages and lush vegetation.</p>

        <p><strong>Warwick Long Bay</strong> provides a quieter alternative — a half-mile expanse of pink sand with fewer crowds, backed by rugged cliffs and dunes. A scenic coastal trail connects this beach to Horseshoe Bay for those wanting to explore both locations.</p>

        <p><strong>Snorkel Park Beach</strong> sits right near the port — a man-made lagoon that's perfect if you're short on time or want to maximize your hours ashore without long transit. Protected waters, beach bar, water sports rentals, and you can walk back to your ship in ten minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Jobson's Cove</strong> offers an intimate experience in a small, protected inlet where calm, shallow waters make it ideal for relaxed swimming and snorkeling. This hidden gem requires a short walk but rewards visitors with exceptional tranquility.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Transportation & Getting Around</h3>
        <p>Bermuda operates an excellent public transportation system that's both affordable and scenic. The ferry service offers two key routes from the Dockyard: the Blue Route reaches Hamilton, the capital city, in approximately 20 minutes, while the Orange Route travels to the historic town of St. George's in about 40 minutes. Both routes provide spectacular water views across the Great Sound.</p>
        <p>Public buses connect the entire island, with Route #7 specifically serving the famous south shore beaches. Day passes offer unlimited travel and excellent value for cruise visitors planning multiple stops.</p>
        <p>Scooter rentals remain popular with visitors, though it's essential to remember that Bermuda follows British driving conventions — you'll be operating on the left side of the road. The island maintains strict regulations prohibiting rental cars to tourists, making scooters, buses, ferries, and taxis the primary transportation options.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Must-See Attractions</h3>
        <p><strong>National Museum of Bermuda:</strong> Located right at the Dockyard within The Keep — the former fortress complex at the heart of the naval base — this institution ranks as the island's premier land-based attraction. The museum chronicles Bermuda's maritime heritage, naval history, and cultural evolution through extensive exhibits. Don't miss Commissioner's House, the oldest cast iron frame residential building in the Western Hemisphere, which now houses museum galleries with sweeping views across the dockyard and Great Sound.</p>

        <p><strong>Glass Beach:</strong> Approximately 30 minutes on foot from the cruise terminal, this unique cove features shoreline covered in polished sea glass — smooth, frosted fragments in blues, greens, and browns, tumbled by decades of wave action.</p>

        <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> The island's capital city offers upscale shopping along Front Street, diverse dining options, pastel-colored colonial architecture, and a distinctly British atmosphere blended with island warmth.</p>

        <p><strong>St. George's:</strong> This UNESCO World Heritage site preserves Bermuda's original settlement, featuring narrow lanes, historic churches, colonial buildings, and authentic 17th-century charm.</p>

        <p><strong>Shipwreck Snorkeling:</strong> With over 300 documented wrecks in surrounding waters, Bermuda offers exceptional underwater exploration. The Constellation and Montana wrecks are particularly accessible and popular with snorkelers of all skill levels.</p>

        <h3>Practical Information for Visitors</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Essential details before stepping ashore.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Though Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory, U.S. dollars are widely accepted throughout the island, typically at a one-to-one exchange rate with the Bermuda dollar.</p>

        <p><strong>Cost Considerations:</strong> Bermuda's prices run significantly higher than typical Caribbean destinations. Budget accordingly for meals, transportation, and activities — this is a premium destination with costs reflecting European pricing rather than Caribbean rates.</p>

        <p><strong>Dress Expectations:</strong> The island maintains somewhat formal standards, particularly in Hamilton's restaurants and business districts. Proper attire is expected — beachwear stays at the beach, and upscale dining venues require appropriate dress.</p>

        <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Despite its mid-Atlantic location, Bermuda can be noticeably cooler than Caribbean islands, particularly during shoulder seasons. Bring a light jacket or sweater, especially for evening activities.</p>

        <p><strong>Port Call Duration:</strong> Many cruise itineraries feature extended Bermuda visits spanning two or even three days, giving you ample opportunity to explore beyond the immediate port area and truly experience the island's diverse attractions.</p>

        <strong>Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake.</strong> This guide draws from published accounts, fellow cruisers, and careful research — but it does not yet carry the weight of my own anchor.
