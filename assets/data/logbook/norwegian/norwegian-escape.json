By the time we boarded Escape, she'd convinced herself she couldn't do anything.\n\nThe [ropes course](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-escape.html) was my idea. Maya's therapist had suggested physical challenges\u2014'embodied accomplishment,' she called it. The course suspended over the ocean looked terrifying. That was the point.\n\nMaya refused the first three days. I didn't push. But I'd see her watching from below, studying others navigate the obstacles.\n\nDay four, she approached the crew. 'Can I just... try the first part?'\n\nThe instructor, Carlos, didn't promise easy. 'It's scary,' he said. 'That's what makes it worth doing.'\n\nMaya made it halfway before freezing on the plank walk. Suspended ten stories up, ocean churning below, she couldn't move forward or back. I watched from the deck, fighting every instinct to rescue her.\n\nCarlos sat on the platform with her. Didn't touch her. Didn't push. Just sat. 'When you're ready,' he said. 'No rush. The ocean isn't going anywhere.'\n\nTwenty minutes later, Maya moved. One step. Then another. By the time she reached the end, she was shaking\u2014but smiling.\n\n'I didn't think I could,' she said, crying into my shoulder.\n\n'But you did.'\n\n**The lesson:** Escape's ropes course isn't adventure tourism\u2014it's therapy at height.",

Not going felt worse.\n\n[The Waterfront](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-escape.html) saved me.\n\nThis outdoor promenade wrapped around the ship let me be alone without being isolated. I'd sit with coffee, watching the Caribbean slide past, sometimes crying, sometimes just breathing. Other passengers walked by without staring. The crew learned my name but not my story.\n\nOne evening, a bartender named Maria noticed me sitting in the same spot for the third night. She didn't ask if I was okay\u2014she could see I wasn't. Instead, she brought a rum punch and said: 'My mother passed three years ago. The ocean helped. It helps everyone eventually.'\n\nI couldn't respond.

'You need to play,' she said. 'Not fancy dinners. Play. Like children.'\n\nThe [Aqua Park](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-escape.html) seemed ridiculous. We were forty-three.

When she emerged at the bottom, sputtering and laughing, she looked like the girl I'd married.\n\n'Your turn!' she yelled up.\n\nI went. And kept going.
