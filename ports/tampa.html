            <summary><h2>My Logbook: Where Cigars Built a City</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p class="author-disclaimer"><em>I visited Tampa in 2023 — my first sailing from this underrated Gulf Coast homeport.</em></p>
            <p>I've sailed from Tampa, and this port surprised me in ways I didn't expect. While Miami and Port Canaveral grab the headlines, Tampa quietly offers one of Florida's most rewarding pre-cruise experiences. The Gulf Coast setting feels different from the Atlantic ports — more relaxed, less frantic, with a working-city authenticity that I find refreshing. And then there's Ybor City, which became my favorite unexpected discovery.</p>
            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/tampa/tampa-panorama.webp" alt="Historic Columbia Restaurant in Ybor City with Spanish tile work and ornate interior, Florida's oldest restaurant since 1905" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Columbia Restaurant — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I walked the brick streets of Ybor City the afternoon before my cruise, and I kept thinking about the thousands of hands that once rolled cigars in these buildings. In 1886, Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his cigar operations from Key West to this palmetto-covered tract northeast of Tampa. The decision transformed everything. Cuban workers followed, then Spaniards and Italians, each wave of immigrants bringing their own mutual aid societies, newspapers, and traditions. By 1900, Tampa had claimed the title "Cigar Capital of the World" — and they meant it.</p>
            <p>The numbers still astonish me. At the industry's peak in 1929, more than 200 factories employed thousands of skilled workers who hand-rolled an astounding 500 million cigars in a single year. I stood in front of one of those old factory buildings — now a boutique hotel — and tried to imagine the scene: workers bent over their rolling tables, lectores reading newspapers aloud to keep them informed and entertained, the air thick with the sweet scent of Cuban tobacco. The cigar industry didn't just employ people; it created an entire culture.</p>
            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/tampa/tampa-hero.webp" alt="Port Tampa Bay cruise terminal with Royal Caribbean ship docked and Tampa skyline visible in the background" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Port Tampa Bay — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What moves me about Ybor City is how it refused to disappear. The cigar industry declined through the Great Depression and beyond — machines replaced hands, tastes changed, factories closed. By the 1970s, the district was dangerous and abandoned. But in the late 1990s, preservation efforts and investment brought the brick streets back to life. Today I walk past cigar shops where craftsmen still roll by hand, using the same techniques those Cuban masters brought over a century ago. The Columbia Restaurant has served Cuban food since 1905, and I had one of the best Cuban sandwiches of my life at their original location.</p>
            <p>The Port of Tampa cruise terminals sit on the Channel District waterfront, and I find myself drawn to this working waterfront heritage. This was once the domain of longshoremen and maritime workers who unloaded Cuban tobacco bound for Ybor City's cigar factories. Ships from Havana arrived with precious tobacco leaves, their cargo destined for the hands of those master cigar rollers just blocks away. The economic chain connected Cuban fields to Tampa factories to American smokers — a transatlantic industry built on skill and tobacco.</p>
            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting in the Columbia Restaurant, surrounded by hand-painted Spanish tiles and ornate ironwork, eating a Cuban sandwich with salami (the Tampa way), knowing that this same room has served these same sandwiches to cigar workers, politicians, and now cruise travelers for over a century. The continuity of place matters here. My eyes filled with unexpected tears—something about those century-old tiles and the knowledge that so many hands had made so many sandwiches in this very spot. My heart swelled with gratitude for places that endure.
            </div>
            <p>I also explored the Tampa Riverwalk before my sailing — 2.6 miles of paved waterfront path connecting museums, parks, and restaurants along the Hillsborough River. The free TECO Line streetcar made getting around effortless, connecting the port area to downtown and Ybor City every 15 minutes. Yet for an underrated cruise port, Tampa offers remarkable urban exploring. The Florida Aquarium sits right on the waterfront near the terminals, and I watched sea turtles glide through tanks while waiting for my embarkation time.</p>
            <p>Tampa also connected me to Cuba in unexpected ways. The Rough Riders departed from here in 1898, Theodore Roosevelt's volunteer cavalry heading to fight in the Spanish-American War. The cigar workers had Cuban roots, maintained Cuban traditions, read Cuban newspapers. The Cuban sandwich itself — that glorious combination of ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard on Cuban bread — was born here, in the cafes where cigar workers took their lunch breaks. Tampa's Cuban heritage runs deep, though it's less obvious than in Miami.</p>
            <p>Port Tampa Bay now handles over a million cruise passengers annually, with Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and Celebrity all sailing from here. The parking rates are among the best in Florida — $17 per day compared to significantly more at other major ports. Tampa International Airport is just 20-25 minutes away, making logistics simple. I've told friends that Tampa deserves more attention from cruisers, and Ybor City alone justifies arriving a day early.</p>
            <p>What I appreciate most about Tampa as a homeport is how the city embraces its maritime heritage. While other Florida ports feel like isolated terminals disconnected from their cities, Tampa integrates the cruise experience into the urban fabric. The free TECO streetcar, the waterfront Riverwalk, the proximity of Ybor City — everything connects. When I walk from my hotel to the cruise terminal, I'm not just passing through parking lots. I'm passing through a living city with stories to tell.</p>

            <p>Looking back at my Tampa visits, I realize this city taught me something about persistence. The cigar workers came, built something beautiful, saw it almost disappear, and then watched it revive. The lesson isn't about nostalgia—it's about believing that what matters can survive, if enough people care enough to keep it alive.</p>

Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and Celebrity all sail from here, offering Western Caribbean, Eastern Caribbean, Cuba, and Mexican Riviera itineraries. The port handles over one million cruise passengers annually, making it a major Florida homeport despite less name recognition than Miami or Port Canaveral.</p>

            <li><strong>Tampa Riverwalk:</strong> 2.6-mile urban waterfront path — not a swimming area but ideal for walking, jogging, or biking. Free to access.</li>
            <li><strong>Ben T. Davis:</strong> Small urban area on the Courtney Campbell Causeway with Tampa skyline views. Free parking. Good for quick sunset visit.</li>
            <li><strong>Davis Islands:</strong> Quiet neighborhood spot near downtown with Tampa Bay views. Wheelchair accessible ramp. Free parking.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: Gulf water temperatures range from 60°F (winter) to 88°F (summer). Summer is swimming season; winter is better for walks.</p>

            <summary><h2>Pre-Cruise Activities and Things to Do</h2></summary>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Most Tampa attractions can be explored independent of ship excursions — the free TECO streetcar makes Ybor City easy to reach on your own. Book ahead for Busch Gardens during peak season. Florida Aquarium offers walk-up tickets but online booking saves time.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ybor City National Historic District</h4>
          <p>This is my top recommendation for Tampa pre-cruise exploring. Founded in 1886 by cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez Ybor, this National Historic Landmark District was once the "Cigar Capital of the World." Walk the brick streets, watch hand-rolled cigar demonstrations at local shops, and eat at the Columbia Restaurant (Florida's oldest, since 1905). The free TECO streetcar connects Ybor to the port area every 15 minutes. Free to explore; allow 2-4 hours for a proper visit.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Busch Gardens Tampa Bay</h4>
          <p>African-themed park with world-class roller coasters including SheiKra (90-degree drop), Iron Gwazi (tallest hybrid coaster), and Cheetah Hunt. Also excellent animal exhibits and live shows. Allow full day. Book tickets in advance through buschgardens.com — significant savings over gate prices. Located 30 minutes from port.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Florida Aquarium</h4>
          <p>Right on the waterfront near cruise terminals — 20,000+ animals including sharks, sea turtles, penguins, and river otters. Touch tanks and interactive exhibits make it family-friendly. Wheelchair accessible throughout. Allow 2-3 hours. Walk-up tickets available but online booking saves time.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">ZooTampa at Lowry Park</h4>
          <p>Florida's manatee rehabilitation center guarantees manatee sightings plus 1,000+ animals. The Straz Family Manatee Rescue Center opens in 2026 with expanded facilities. Best manatee viewing December-March. Allow half day. Book tickets online for best prices.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">The Dalí Museum (St. Petersburg)</h4>
          <p>World's most comprehensive collection of Salvador Dalí's work — stunning building with spiral staircase and over 2,400 objects. Located 30 minutes from Tampa in downtown St. Petersburg. Allow 2-3 hours. Reserve tickets in advance through thedali.org, especially weekends.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tampa Riverwalk</h4>
          <p>2.6-mile paved waterfront path connecting museums, parks, restaurants, and the Convention Center. Free to access. Bike rentals available. The walk from port area to Armature Works takes about 45 minutes at a leisurely pace. This renovated trolley barn houses multiple vendors under one roof with excellent Tampa Bay views.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Clearwater Day Trip</h4>
          <p>30 minutes west via the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Consistently rated America's best Gulf destination by TripAdvisor. Pier 60 features nightly sunset celebrations with street performers and artisans. Independent visit easy by car or rideshare; no ship excursion needed. The crystal-clear Gulf water is ideal for swimming, snorkeling, or just floating in the warm waves.</p>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>Tampa is a major American city with all modern conveniences. Currency is US dollars, and credit cards are accepted everywhere. The city is flat and walkable in the downtown and Ybor City areas. The free TECO streetcar makes exploring remarkably easy — connecting the cruise terminal area to Ybor City every 15 minutes. Comfortable walking shoes recommended for brick streets in Ybor.</p>
          <p>Tampa is generally safe for tourists, with well-patrolled downtown and Ybor City areas. Ybor's entertainment district can get rowdy late at night on weekends, but daytime exploring is family-friendly. The Riverwalk is well-maintained and popular with locals. Standard urban awareness applies.</p>
          <p>Cell service is excellent throughout Tampa. Free WiFi available at hotels, cafes, and many public spaces. Uber and Lyft operate extensively. Accessibility is good — both cruise terminals accommodate wheelchairs, and major attractions offer accessible options. Tipping follows standard US norms: 18-20% at restaurants, $2-3 per bag for porters, and 15-20% for taxis. Tampa Airport (TPA) is one of the nation's best-rated airports for efficiency.</p>

            <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <p><strong>Q: Which cruise lines sail from Tampa?</strong><br>A: Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and Celebrity all sail from Port Tampa Bay. Ships depart for Western Caribbean, Eastern Caribbean, Cuba, and Mexican Riviera itineraries. The port handles over one million passengers annually.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How far is Tampa Airport from the cruise port?</strong><br>A: Tampa International Airport (TPA) is just 20-25 minutes from the cruise port — one of the easiest airport-to-port connections in Florida. Uber/Lyft runs $15-25. Several hotels offer free cruise shuttles including Hampton Inn Ybor City.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Tampa vs. Port Canaveral — which is better?</strong><br>A: Tampa offers easier parking ($17/day), less congestion, and Ybor City's unique heritage. Port Canaveral is closer to Orlando theme parks and Kennedy Space Center. Choose based on whether you want theme park access or a more relaxed, culturally rich pre-cruise experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Ybor City worth visiting before a Tampa cruise?</strong><br>A: Absolutely — this is my top recommendation. The National Historic Landmark District was the "Cigar Capital of the World." Cuban sandwiches, hand-rolled cigars, and the free TECO streetcar makes it easy to explore. The Columbia Restaurant (since 1905) is worth the visit alone.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How much is cruise port parking in Tampa?</strong><br>A: Port Tampa Bay garage costs $17/day — some of the best rates among major Florida cruise ports. Off-site lots offer rates as low as $11/day with shuttle service. Reserve ahead during peak sailing dates and holidays.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Will rain ruin my port day?</strong><br>A: Brief showers are common in many destinations but rarely last long enough to significantly impact your day.

          <p class="pier-note">Port Tampa Bay's cruise terminals are in the Channelside district on Garrison Channel. The Florida Aquarium and Sparkman Wharf are within easy walking distance. The Tampa Riverwalk connects to downtown attractions along the Hillsborough River. Ybor City, Tampa's historic Latin quarter, is about 10 minutes by taxi or streetcar. The TECO Line Streetcar runs from near the port to Ybor City.</p>

        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. The details reflect what I found on the ground, though ports change—always verify current conditions for your voyage.</p>
