        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship at Greenock into Scottish air—cool, damp, carrying the scent of rain that had just stopped and the promise of more to come. The sky hung low and gray, but streaks of brightness broke through where the sun tried to assert itself against the clouds. This is Scotland's welcome: moody, atmospheric, impossibly romantic even when the weather refuses to cooperate. The Clyde estuary stretched before me, its waters slate-colored under the clouds, and I could already feel the pull of Glasgow waiting forty minutes away by train.</p>

            <p>Nobody comes to Greenock for Greenock—I'll be honest about that. This is a gateway port, a place where ships dock because the river is deep enough and the train to Glasgow runs frequently and reliably. However, there is something noble about Greenock's working-class authenticity, its red brick buildings and industrial heritage, its claim to James Watt, inventor of the modern steam engine. The town doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. I appreciated that frankness even as I hurried toward the train station, eager to reach the city that had filled my imagination since childhood.</p>

            <p>Glasgow Cathedral stopped me cold. The medieval stone nave soared upward into shadows, light filtering through ancient stained glass in colors that time has softened to something almost unearthly. I descended to the lower church, a crypt-like space where St. Mungo lies buried, the patron saint of a city that has never forgotten its religious roots. A volunteer organist was practicing Bach, the music echoing off stones that have stood since the twelfth century. Tears pricked my eyes unexpectedly—not from sadness but from the accumulated weight of all those centuries of prayer and praise, still resonating in that sacred space. My heart swelled with gratitude for the privilege of standing where so many pilgrims had stood before me.</p>

            <p>Yet it was the Kelvingrove that truly captured my heart. The museum rises like a Spanish cathedral on the banks of the Kelvin River, red sandstone glowing warmly even under gray skies. Inside, Salvador Dalí's Christ of Saint John of the Cross hangs in hushed reverence—a painting so luminous it seems to generate its own light, drawing visitors into contemplative silence. I wandered through galleries of Scottish art and Egyptian antiquities, past suits of armor polished to mirror brightness and natural history specimens arranged with Victorian precision, past families with children pointing at dinosaur skeletons and students sketching in well-worn notebooks. An organ began playing somewhere in the building's vast interior, the sound drifting through halls like a blessing. The museum is free, which still astonishes me. Glasgow simply gives away one of Europe's finest collections because culture, they believe, should belong to everyone. I spent hours there, losing track of time in that red sandstone cathedral of curiosity.</p>

            <p>Lunch came at a Glasgow pub—proper fish and chips with mushy peas for £12, washed down with a pint of local ale. The cod arrived in batter so crisp it shattered at the first bite, the flesh inside white and flaky and tasting faintly of the sea. Around me, office workers ate their lunch and students argued about football, the sound of Glasgow accents rising and falling like music. I thought about how different this felt from the polished tourist experiences in so many ports—this was real life, a city going about its business, and I was simply a guest at their table. I felt blessed to have discovered this warm, unpretentious welcome.</p>

            <p>The train back to Greenock passed through landscapes that explained why Scotland has inspired so many poets and painters. Green hills rolled toward distant mountains wreathed in mist, their flanks dotted with sheep like scattered cotton. Stone walls divided fields into ancient patterns that predated memory. The sky cleared briefly, and suddenly everything glowed with that particular Scottish light—golden and ethereal, the kind of light that makes you believe in magic and miracles and the old stories. I understood then why so many Scottish emigrants carried these landscapes in their hearts across oceans, and why they named new places Nova Scotia and Caledonia, trying to recreate what could never truly be replaced. The beauty was almost painful in its perfection.</p>

            <p>Greenock welcomed me back with rain—of course—but I didn't mind. The drops felt like a benediction after all I had seen and felt. Scotland had given me medieval cathedrals and world-class art, fish and chips and honest conversation, landscapes that will haunt my dreams for years to come. The ship waited at the Ocean Terminal, its lights glowing warm and inviting against the darkening Scottish sky, ready to carry me onward to the next adventure. I climbed the gangway feeling profoundly grateful for this gateway that had opened onto so much wonder.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at Greenock Ocean Terminal, a modern facility on the Clyde estuary approximately 25 miles west of Glasgow. The terminal offers basic amenities and shuttle service to Greenock town center and the train station. Most passengers use Greenock as a gateway to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Loch Lomond, or other Scottish destinations rather than exploring the town itself.</p>

            <p>The train station (Greenock Central or Greenock West) is a short walk or shuttle ride from the terminal. ScotRail trains run frequently to Glasgow Central (40-50 minutes, £6-8). From Glasgow, connections to Edinburgh, Stirling, and beyond are straightforward. Ship excursions also depart from the terminal to various Scottish destinations.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Getting to Glasgow requires minimal physical effort—just the train ride. Glasgow itself is walkable but hilly in places, so comfortable shoes are essential. Kelvingrove Museum and the city center are manageable for most mobility levels. Loch Lomond excursions involve coach travel with walking at various stops. Wheelchair users will find Glasgow reasonably accessible; Greenock itself has uneven pavements in places. Budget 8-10 hours for a Glasgow day trip or organized Highland excursion.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Train to Glasgow:</strong> The best option for most visitors. ScotRail trains from Greenock Central or West to Glasgow Central take 40-50 minutes and cost £6-8 each way. Buy tickets at the station or online at scotrail.co.uk. Trains run approximately every 30 minutes. Check return schedules to ensure you're back before the ship departs.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxi to Glasgow:</strong> Approximately £40-50 each way, taking 40-45 minutes depending on traffic. Useful for groups of 3-4 who can split the cost. Arrange return pickup or take the train back.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer convenient packages to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Loch Lomond, and Stirling Castle ($80-200). Going <strong>independent</strong> to Glasgow is easy and cheaper—the train is reliable and Glasgow is very walkable. For Edinburgh (1.5-2 hours away), organized tours handle the logistics better. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular Loch Lomond tours. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, note train times carefully or use ship excursions.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking in Greenock:</strong> The town center is walkable from the terminal (15-20 minutes or use the shuttle). The McLean Museum and James Watt sites are accessible on foot. Greenock has its own charm but limited attractions compared to Glasgow.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The Ocean Terminal is accessible with level boarding. Trains to Glasgow have accessibility features including level access at many stations. Glasgow itself is reasonably accessible with dropped curbs and accessible public transport, though some areas are hilly. Kelvingrove Museum is fully accessible. Historic sites like Glasgow Cathedral have some stairs and uneven surfaces.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Greenock is a gateway port—the best experiences lie in Glasgow and beyond. <strong>Independent</strong> travel to Glasgow is straightforward and rewarding. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> make sense for Edinburgh, Loch Lomond, or Stirling where logistics are more complex. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for popular Highland tours.</p>

            <h3>Glasgow City Exploration</h3>
            <p>Scotland's largest city offers world-class attractions within easy reach. Take the train (40 minutes, £6-8) and explore independently. Start at Glasgow Cathedral (free)—medieval stone masterpiece with atmospheric crypt. Walk to Kelvingrove Museum (free)—one of Europe's finest collections including Dalí, Mackintosh, and natural history. Explore George Square and Merchant City's Victorian architecture. Visit the Riverside Museum (free) for transport history. Budget £15-25 for lunch at a traditional pub. Allow full day. Return trains run until evening.</p>

            <h3>Kelvingrove Museum</h3>
            <p>Glasgow's crown jewel deserves special attention. The red sandstone building alone is worth the visit, but inside you'll find Salvador Dalí's Christ of Saint John of the Cross, Charles Rennie Mackintosh designs, Scottish Colourist paintings, Egyptian mummies, and natural history displays. Completely free. The organ recitals at 1pm on most days are wonderful. Café on site for lunch (£10-15). Tram from Glasgow Central or pleasant 20-minute walk through Kelvingrove Park. Allow 2-3 hours minimum.</p>

            <h3>Loch Lomond & Trossachs</h3>
            <p>Scotland's most famous loch lies about an hour north of Greenock—"bonnie banks" immortalized in song, surrounded by Highland scenery. Ship excursions ($90-150) typically include coach journey through stunning landscapes, time in the village of Luss, and sometimes a boat cruise on the loch. Independent travel is possible but ship tours handle logistics efficiently and ensure timely return. Allow full day. Best in clear weather when the views are spectacular.</p>

            <h3>Stirling Castle</h3>
            <p>Dramatic hilltop fortress where Scottish history was forged. William Wallace and Robert the Bruce both fought here for Scottish independence. The Renaissance palace, Great Hall, and chapel are beautifully restored. Spectacular views over the Highlands from the ramparts. Located 1.5 hours from Greenock by coach. Ship excursions ($100-150) often combine Stirling with Loch Lomond or other sites. Entry approximately £18. Allow full day including travel. History enthusiasts will find this essential.</p>

            <h3>Edinburgh Day Trip</h3>
            <p>Scotland's capital is achievable from Greenock but ambitious—1.5-2 hours each way means 3-4 hours of travel. Ship excursions ($150-200) maximize your time with direct coach transport. Independent travel requires train to Glasgow, then Glasgow to Edinburgh. If you want Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile, organized tours make better use of limited time. Consider saving Edinburgh for a dedicated visit if your itinerary allows.</p>

            <h3>Whisky Distillery Tours</h3>
            <p>Several distilleries within reach of Greenock offer tours and tastings. Auchentoshan (Lowland single malt) is closest—about 30 minutes toward Glasgow. Ship excursions to Highland distilleries combine whisky education with scenic landscapes. Expect £15-25 for distillery tours including tasting. Must be 18+ for tastings. Don't drive afterward—use organized tours or designated drivers.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> British Pound Sterling (£ / GBP). Credit and debit cards accepted nearly everywhere. Contactless payment widely used. ATMs available but rarely needed for day trips.</p>

            <p><strong>Language:</strong> English with Scottish accents that can be challenging for some visitors. Glaswegians are famously friendly and will happily slow down or clarify. "Aye" means yes, "wee" means small.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Scottish weather is famously unpredictable—rain can arrive at any moment, even in summer. Temperatures 12-18°C (54-64°F) in summer, colder in spring and autumn. Pack layers and a waterproof jacket regardless of the forecast. As Scots say: "If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes."</p>

            <p><strong>Food & Drink:</strong> Fish and chips at Glasgow pubs (£10-15) are excellent. Full Scottish breakfast includes haggis, black pudding, and tattie scones. Cullen skink is creamy smoked haddock soup—perfect on cold days. Scotch whisky tastings available throughout Glasgow. Irn-Bru is Scotland's beloved orange soft drink. Tablet is intensely sweet Scottish fudge.</p>

            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> Not obligatory in UK but appreciated. Round up at pubs, 10% at restaurants for good service. Taxi drivers don't expect tips but appreciate rounding up.</p>

            <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Glasgow offers excellent shopping—Buchanan Street for high street brands, Merchant City for independent shops. Whisky, tartan items, and Scottish crafts make good souvenirs. Edinburgh Crystal and Harris Tweed are quality Scottish products.</p>
