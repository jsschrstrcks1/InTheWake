      "markdown": "**Royal Princess debuted in 2013 as the first Royal Class ship, introducing innovations that defined Princess Cruises through [Discovery Princess](/ships/princess/discovery-princess.html) a decade later.**\n\nThe ship established the Royal Class template: the Piazza atrium bringing Italian plaza ambiance aboard, the SeaWalk glass-bottomed walkway extending over the ocean, and the overwater bar and lounge creating new entertainment spaces.\n\nMost significantly, Royal Princess previewed OceanMedallion technology that would later become MedallionClass fleet-wide. The wearable device that unlocks doors, enables touchless payments, and locates family members began its journey here.\n\nAt 142,000 gross tons and 3,560 passengers, Royal Princess represented the largest Princess ship at her debut. That scale now feels mid-fleet after [Sun Princess](/ships/princess/sun-princess.html), but remains larger than classic vessels like [Coral Princess](/ships/princess/coral-princess.html).\n\nFor Princess loyalists, Royal Princess holds special significance. She bridges the intimate grand-class era and the mega-ship future. Sailing her means experiencing the moment Princess decided to grow—and how they chose to do it.",

      "markdown": "**Step onto glass sixty feet above the ocean. Watch waves pass beneath your feet. Royal Princess's SeaWalk delivers precisely this vertigo-inducing experience.**\n\nThe glass-bottomed walkway extends twenty-eight feet beyond the ship's edge on Deck 16. Below, nothing but air and ocean. The perspective transforms how you see the ship—suddenly massive, suddenly fragile, suddenly extraordinarily engineered.\n\nFirst-timers often hesitate at the entrance. The brain protests walking on glass over open water. But once you commit, the view rewards courage. Sunset strolls on SeaWalk become addictive. Morning coffee while watching dolphins below becomes ritual.\n\nThe design has been replicated across Royal Class—[Regal Princess](/ships/princess/regal-princess.html), [Majestic Princess](/ships/princess/majestic-princess.html), and subsequent sisters all include SeaWalk. But Royal Princess originated the concept.\n\nFor adventure-seekers who don't need waterslides or surf simulators, SeaWalk offers gentler thrills. The excitement comes from perspective shift, not physical challenge. You walk on glass over ocean. That's quite enough adventure for many of us.",

      "markdown": "**Royal Princess sails Mediterranean waters seasonally, and her Royal Class size proves ideal for European ports that larger ships overwhelm.**\n\nAt 3,560 guests, Royal Princess lands in a sweet spot for Mediterranean cruising. Large enough for variety—multiple dining venues, entertainment options, pool areas—yet small enough for smooth operations in historic ports.\n\nCivitavecchia for Rome works well. Livorno for Florence docks directly. Barcelona, Marseille, and Naples handle Royal Class efficiently without the capacity concerns that mega-ships create.\n\nThe MedallionClass technology particularly shines in port-intensive itineraries. Disembarkation flows smoothly. Re-boarding requires seconds. The efficiencies compound over a week of daily ports.\n\nRoyal Princess's Piazza captures Mediterranean atmosphere intentionally. The Italian plaza design feels natural when sailing Italian and Spanish waters. You transit from shipboard café to Roman café without jarring contrast.\n\nFor Mediterranean priorities: Royal Princess offers Princess quality at Princess scale in waters Princess understands. The combination delivers reliably.",

      "markdown": "**We sailed Royal Princess on her inaugural Mediterranean season. We've returned three times since. Here's why she keeps bringing us back.**\n\nThe ship has aged well. A decade of operation means refined operations—crew understand traffic flow, entertainment timing, dining rhythms. The inaugural-season learning curve ended long ago.\n\nRoyal Class technology matured alongside the ship. The OceanMedallion that felt gimmicky in 2013 now feels essential. We unlock doors, order drinks, and find each other effortlessly. The technology recedes into seamless experience.\n\nThe Piazza remains our favorite onboard space. Italian café atmosphere, live music, human-scale gathering. We've celebrated anniversaries here, made friends over prosecco here, watched rainy days pass comfortably here.\n\nThe ship's size still works for us. Large enough for variety, intimate enough for community. We recognize fellow passengers by day three. The servers learn our preferences. The experience personalizes naturally.\n\nNewer Princess ships offer more features. [Sun Princess](/ships/princess/sun-princess.html) has the Sphere. But Royal Princess has what we want: proven quality, familiar excellence, the comfort of returning somewhere that feels like home.",
