      "markdown": "**Grand Princess debuted in 1998 as the world's largest cruise ship—and established the design philosophy that shaped Princess Cruises for a generation.**\n\nAt 109,000 gross tons, Grand Princess seemed impossibly massive when she launched. That scale now appears mid-sized against Sphere Class behemoths, but the ambition was revolutionary for its era.\n\nMore importantly, Grand Princess established the design vocabulary Princess would use for two decades. Movies Under the Stars began here. The wedding chapel appeared here. The Skywalkers Nightclub on Deck 17 created nightlife high above the ocean.\n\nThe Grand Class design spawned five sister ships: [Crown Princess](/ships/princess/crown-princess.html), [Emerald Princess](/ships/princess/emerald-princess.html), [Ruby Princess](/ships/princess/ruby-princess.html), and others. The template proved durable.\n\nFor travelers who appreciate maritime heritage, Grand Princess represents a turning point. She's the ship that transformed Princess from classic cruise line to modern competitor. Every subsequent Princess innovation traces roots to what Grand Princess proved possible.",

      "markdown": "**In March 2020, Grand Princess became unwilling international news when she was held off San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic's early days.**\n\nPassengers watched from their cabins as the world debated their fate. The ship circled off the California coast while authorities determined protocols that didn't yet exist. The images—helicopters delivering tests, passengers waving from balconies—defined the pandemic's early maritime impact.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for passengers and crew. But it also demonstrated Princess's crisis management capabilities. Eventually, organized disembarkation, medical protocols, and passenger care proved that the industry could adapt to unprecedented challenges.\n\nGrand Princess returned to service when cruising resumed. She sails today, carrying passengers who may or may not know her history. The ship that represented crisis now represents resilience.\n\nFor travelers: Grand Princess's 2020 experience informed every cruise line's pandemic response. The protocols developed there protected millions of subsequent passengers. History happened aboard, and the industry learned.",

      "markdown": "**Grand Princess was cutting-edge in 1998. Today she's a value proposition—Princess quality at pricing that reflects her age.**\n\nWhat you get: Princess service standards, which remain fleet-wide. Proper dining rooms with trained servers. Entertainment programming. Movies Under the Stars. The core cruise experience that Princess has refined for decades.\n\nWhat you trade: The newest technology. The latest venues. The innovations that Royal Class or Sphere Class ships provide. Grand Princess has been refurbished, but she cannot match what newer ships offer.\n\nThe calculation is personal. If Princess atmosphere matters more than Princess innovation, Grand Princess delivers at lower cost. The savings can fund better cabins, more specialty dining, or additional cruises.\n\nThe passenger demographic tends older and more experienced. Fellow travelers know what cruising offers and value it accordingly. The conversations differ from first-timer-heavy itineraries.\n\nFor value-conscious cruisers: Grand Princess offers the opportunity to experience Princess's service culture without premium pricing for newest ships.",
