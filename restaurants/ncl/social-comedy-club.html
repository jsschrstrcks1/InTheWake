      <h3>Social Comedy & Night Club Review: Double Duty Done Well</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Social Comedy & Night Club is a dual-purpose venue on Prima and Viva class ships — comedy club in the early evening, nightclub after 10 p.m. It's NCL's updated take on entertainment spaces, combining two functions that share the same room. Drinks are served by cocktail waitstaff or available at the bar, covered by the beverage package or priced individually.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>Standard NCL bar card for both modes. During comedy shows, beer and simple mixed drinks are the fastest orders — the cocktail servers can't handle complex drinks in a dark theater efficiently. Rum-and-Coke, Vodka Soda, and draft beer dominate. During nightclub mode, it's shots, frozen drinks, and Vodka-Redbull territory. The bar area at the back of the room serves both functions. No comedy-themed cocktails, no nightclub specials — just the same card as every other bar. A missed opportunity to create "The Punchline" or a signature shot, but NCL hasn't gone there yet.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>During comedy shows, cocktail servers navigate the room efficiently — quiet, discreet, professional. They're well-trained for the environment. During nightclub mode, the bar gets busy but service is fast. The dual-function means the staff pivot from calm table service to high-energy nightclub pouring in the same evening — impressive versatility. Wait times are reasonable in both modes.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The room is purpose-built for the dual function and it works. During comedy shows, the lighting drops to stage-focused, seating is theater-style with cocktail tables, and the intimacy is real — the comedian can see every face. The sound system is excellent. After the transition to nightclub mode, the lights go LED, the DJ booth activates, the dance floor opens up, and the energy shifts completely. The transformation is impressive — same room, different universe. On Prima and Viva, the space is larger and more polished than the Headliners setup on older ships. It gets warm with a full house in either mode.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> Social succeeds as a dual-purpose venue — the comedy is consistently entertaining and the nightclub transformation is impressive. Drinks are functional but generic. It loses points for the standard drink menu across both modes and the lack of any venue-specific cocktail program. <em>Tip:</em> See the late-night adults-only comedy show, then stay as the venue transitions to nightclub — the energy carries over and you're already in the best seats.</p>
