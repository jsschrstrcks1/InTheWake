          <h2>My Logbook: Venice of America</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've sailed from Fort Lauderdale, and what struck me immediately was how different Port Everglades felt from Miami. Despite being only 30 miles north, the atmosphere was calmer, the traffic lighter, and the embarkation process remarkably smooth. Port Everglades handles over 4 million passengers annually — making it Florida's second-busiest cruise port — yet somehow maintains a more manageable feel than its bigger neighbor to the south.</p>
            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/ft-lauderdale/port-everglades-terminal.webp" alt="Port Everglades cruise terminal with Royal Caribbean ship docked and palm trees lining the waterfront" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Port Everglades — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The night before my sailing, I walked along Las Olas Boulevard as the sun set over the Intracoastal Waterway. This elegant street connects downtown Fort Lauderdale to the beach, and I found myself stopping at nearly every block to admire the art galleries, boutique shops, and sidewalk cafes. The architecture has a Mediterranean quality that surprised me — terra cotta roofs, wrought-iron balconies, bougainvillea spilling over walls. Though Fort Lauderdale lacks Miami's Art Deco fame, Las Olas has its own sophisticated beauty.</p>
            <p>Fort Lauderdale calls itself the "Venice of America," and after taking a Water Taxi through the canal system, I understand why. The city has over 300 miles of navigable waterways — more than Venice, Italy. My Water Taxi wove past mega-yachts at private docks, waterfront mansions with pools overlooking the canal, and small restaurants where boats pulled up like cars at a drive-through. The Water Taxi system isn't just a tour — it's actual transportation, connecting beach hotels, Las Olas, and downtown stops.</p>

              <figcaption>Water Taxi canals — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The morning of my cruise, I arrived at Port Everglades around 11am. But what struck me was the efficiency. Porters grabbed my bags curbside, security moved quickly, and I was walking the gangway within 90 minutes of parking my car. Compare that to some larger ports where the process can stretch to three hours. The terminals themselves are modern and air-conditioned — a blessing in Florida's humidity.</p>
            <p>What I appreciate most about Fort Lauderdale as a homeport is the beach access. Fort Lauderdale Beach stretches for 7 miles along A1A, with a beachfront promenade perfect for morning runs or sunset walks. Unlike South Beach's party atmosphere, Fort Lauderdale Beach has a more relaxed, upscale feel. Yet families are everywhere, and the water is typically calmer than the Atlantic beaches further north. I spent my pre-cruise afternoon floating in the warm turquoise water, thinking about how lucky cruisers are to have this as their departure point.</p>
            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting at a waterfront table on Las Olas as a parade of boats cruised past — sailboats, fishing boats, mega-yachts, and the Water Taxi all sharing the same canal. The sunset painted everything gold, and I thought: this is what Florida is supposed to be, before the crowds and the theme parks. Old Florida glamour meets modern convenience.
            </div>
            <p>I also explored Hollywood Beach, just 15 minutes south of the port. The Hollywood Broadwalk is a 2.5-mile brick promenade along the beach with a distinctly different character — more laid-back, more European with its beachfront cafes and bike lanes. Some cruisers prefer Hollywood to Fort Lauderdale Beach precisely because it feels less commercial. The Margaritaville Beach Resort anchors one end, but the rest of the Broadwalk maintains a charming, almost old-fashioned beach town atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The Everglades are only 45 minutes west, and I've done the airboat tours on previous visits. Gliding through sawgrass marshes, spotting alligators sunning themselves on the banks, watching great blue herons launch into flight — it's a world apart from the beach and boulevards. If you have a full pre-cruise day, the Everglades make an excellent half-day adventure before you trade Florida's wilderness for the Caribbean's islands.</p>
            <p>Port Everglades serves as homeport for Royal Caribbean's largest ships, including Oasis-class vessels. Celebrity, Princess, Holland America, Cunard, and Seabourn all sail from here regularly. However, the port handles this volume gracefully — perhaps because the terminals are spread along several miles of waterfront rather than concentrated in one massive complex. Each terminal feels almost like its own small port.</p>
            <p>What I tell friends considering Fort Lauderdale versus Miami: if you want nightlife and South Beach energy, choose Miami. If you want easier logistics, better parking rates, and an equally beautiful beach with a more relaxed vibe, choose Fort Lauderdale. The airport is close to both, though Fort Lauderdale's airport-to-port connection is slightly smoother. For me, the choice is clear — I'll take the Venice of America's canals over Miami's traffic every time.</p>
            <p>I should mention the food scene, which exceeded my expectations. Las Olas alone offers everything from casual sidewalk pizza to upscale Italian, and the waterfront restaurants serve some of Florida's freshest seafood. I had stone crab claws at Coconuts by the Water while boats docked steps away — the kind of quintessentially Florida experience that makes pre-cruise days here special. Hollywood Beach has its own charming restaurants along the Broadwalk, with a more European feel and outdoor seating facing the ocean.</p>

        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Port Everglades operates multiple cruise terminals along the Intracoastal Waterway in southeast Fort Lauderdale. The port handles over 4 million cruise passengers annually — Florida's second-busiest after Miami. Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Princess, Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, and Silversea all homeport here, with ships departing for Caribbean, Bahamas, and transatlantic itineraries.</p>
          <figure class="logbook-image">

          </figure>
          <p>All terminals are wheelchair accessible with modern facilities. Embarkation typically runs 11am-4pm. The port address is 1850 Eller Drive, Fort Lauderdale FL 33316 — though specific terminal addresses vary by cruise line. Drop luggage curbside with porters ($2-3 tip per bag) before parking. Currency is US dollars, and the port area offers restrooms and water. Fort Lauderdale Beach is 10 minutes away.</p>

          <h2>Sandy Shores</h2>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale offers some of Florida's best coastlines with warm Atlantic water and well-maintained facilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fort Lauderdale Public Area (10 min):</strong> 7 miles of pristine sand along A1A. Beachfront promenade with cafes and restaurants. Metered parking ($3/hour) or public lots. Calmer waves than further north, great for swimming.</li>
            <li><strong>Hollywood Broadwalk (15 min):</strong> 2.5-mile brick promenade with European beach town atmosphere. Less commercial than Fort Lauderdale, excellent for families. Free access; parking $2-5/hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Hugh Taylor Birch State Park:</strong> 180-acre urban oasis with beach access, nature trails, and kayak rentals. $6 vehicle entry. Quieter alternative to main tourist strips.</li>
            <li><strong>Dania Coastal Area (10 min):</strong> Smaller, less crowded option near Port Everglades. Free parking on weekdays. Popular with locals.</li>
            <li><strong>Pompano Area (20 min north):</strong> Fishing pier and wide sandy stretches. Less touristy atmosphere. Excellent for a quieter pre-cruise morning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: Atlantic water temperatures range from 72°F (winter) to 84°F (summer). Swimming is excellent year-round, though winter mornings can feel cool.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Cruise Activities and Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Most Fort Lauderdale attractions can be explored independent of ship excursions — the Water Taxi system makes canal touring easy on your own. Book ahead for Everglades airboat tours during peak season. Beach access is always free.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Las Olas Boulevard</h4>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale's premier street connects downtown to the beach. Art galleries, boutiques, sidewalk cafes, and upscale dining stretch for blocks. The architecture has Mediterranean flair — terra cotta roofs and bougainvillea-draped walls. Free to explore; allow 2-3 hours for shopping and a meal. Evening visits offer beautiful sunset views over the Intracoastal.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Water Taxi Canal Tours</h4>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale has over 300 miles of navigable waterways — more canals than Venice. The Water Taxi system offers all-day passes ($28) to hop on and off at various stops, touring past mega-yachts, waterfront mansions, and restaurant docks. Independent exploration is easy; no ship excursion needed. Boats run every 30 minutes.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Everglades Airboat Adventures</h4>
          <p>Sawgrass Recreation Park and other operators offer 45-minute to 2-hour airboat tours through the Everglades, just 45 minutes west of Fort Lauderdale. Glide through sawgrass marshes, spot alligators sunning on banks, watch great blue herons take flight, and experience authentic Florida wilderness completely different from the beach. Book ahead during peak season through operator websites. Half-day tours fit easily into a pre-cruise morning and leave time for lunch before embarkation.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">NSU Art Museum</h4>
          <p>One of the largest contemporary art museums in Florida, featuring works by major American and international artists. Located on Las Olas Boulevard. Allow 2 hours. Wheelchair accessible throughout. Book tickets online for best prices.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fort Lauderdale Coastal Promenade</h4>
          <p>Seven miles of beachfront walkway along A1A, perfect for morning runs, cycling, or sunset strolls. Street performers, cafes, and beach volleyball courts line the route. Free to access. Bike rentals available at several locations. The promenade connects multiple beach areas and parking lots.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Bonnet House Museum &amp; Gardens</h4>
          <p>35-acre historic estate with subtropical gardens, art collection, and wildlife (monkeys live on the grounds!). Guided tours explain the eccentric artists who built this oasis. Allow 2 hours. Book ahead through bonnethouse.org. A hidden gem most tourists miss.</p>
          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hollywood Broadwalk</h4>
          <p>Just 15 minutes south of Port Everglades, this 2.5-mile brick promenade offers a more laid-back alternative to Fort Lauderdale Beach. European-style beachfront cafes, bike lanes, and beach volleyball courts line the route. The Margaritaville Beach Resort anchors one end, but the rest maintains old-fashioned beach town charm. Free to access; parking $2-5/hour. Perfect for a relaxed pre-cruise morning walk.</p>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale is a major American city with all modern conveniences. Currency is US dollars, and credit cards are accepted everywhere. The beach and Las Olas areas are walkable and well-maintained. The Water Taxi system makes exploring canals remarkably easy — day passes work like a hop-on hop-off tour.</p>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale is generally safe for tourists, with well-patrolled beach and downtown areas. However, as with any major city, use standard urban awareness. The beach promenade is popular with joggers and cyclists at all hours. Las Olas feels upscale and secure, even late evening.</p>
          <p>Cell service is excellent throughout Fort Lauderdale. Free WiFi available at hotels, cafes, and many beach establishments. Uber and Lyft operate extensively and work well for getting between the beach, Las Olas, and the port. Accessibility is good — beach wheelchairs available at some access points, and major attractions accommodate mobility needs. Most restaurants along Las Olas have outdoor seating accessible from street level. Tipping follows standard US norms: 18-20% at full-service locations, $2-3 per bag for cruise porters.</p>
