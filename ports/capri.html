        <h1>Capri: The Island That Stopped Time</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Emperor Tiberius ruled the Roman Empire from this island. Not Rome — Capri. He built twelve villas across these cliffs, governed the known world from terraced gardens overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea, and never went back. After one visit, I understood completely. Capri doesn't feel like Italy. It feels like the Mediterranean distilled to its absolute essence — vertical limestone cliffs plunging into water so blue it rewrites your internal definition of the color, villages that cling to rock faces like ambitious barnacles, and an atmosphere of cultivated leisure that's been perfected over two thousand years.</p>

          <p>Your ship won't dock here. Capri is too beautiful, too vertical, too stubbornly itself to accommodate cruise terminals. Ships anchor offshore, and you tender to Marina Grande, the working harbor where fishermen still mend nets between ferry arrivals. The ride in reveals why this island captivated everyone from Roman emperors to Graham Greene — sheer cliffs rising six hundred feet straight from the sea, whitewashed houses cascading down slopes at angles that defy both gravity and building codes, and those three limestone sea stacks called the Faraglioni rising from the water like the ruins of a giant's cathedral.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting in the tiny rowboat outside the Blue Grotto entrance, watching the boatman time the waves. The opening is maybe three feet high at low tide — you lie flat in the boat while he pulls you through on a chain bolted to the rock. Then you're inside, and the whole world turns blue. Not painted blue, not filtered blue, but a luminous electric azure that seems to emanate from the water itself, refracting through the underwater cave entrance. It lasts five minutes before they pull you back out. Five minutes that rewire something in your brain about what water can look like when sunlight meets geology in exactly the right way.
          </div>

          <p>But here's the secret they don't tell you: Capri is more than the Grotto. The Monte Solaro chairlift carries you twelve minutes straight up to the island's highest point, your legs dangling over gardens and goat paths and increasingly astonishing views. At the summit, the entire Bay of Naples spreads below — Sorrento to the north, Vesuvius smoking faintly on the horizon, the Amalfi Coast serrating the shoreline. You're suspended between sea and sky, and you understand why emperors chose this specific rock in this specific sea to build their paradise.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you tender ashore.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Tender port — ships anchor offshore; tender boats to Marina Grande (20-30 min depending on conditions)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Town:</strong> Capri town is 450 feet above Marina Grande; funicular railway 5 min ride (€2.20 one way)</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Yes — tendering required; can be first or last off depending on ship tender ticket system</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (€); ATMs in Capri town; credit cards widely accepted; Marina Grande has exchange offices</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Italian; English spoken in tourist areas, shops, and restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>Getting from Mainland:</strong> 30 min hydrofoil from Sorrento (~€20 one way); ferries from Naples (40-80 min depending on vessel type)</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> April-June and September-October (warm, fewer crowds); July-August extremely crowded; winter many businesses close</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurza)</h4>
          <p>Capri's most famous attraction — a sea cave where sunlight entering through an underwater opening creates an otherworldly electric blue glow. Transfer to small rowboats (2 passengers + boatman) at cave entrance. €18 total (€12 rowboat + €6 entrance). Best light noon-2pm. CRITICAL: Closes frequently due to weather (cannot book in advance). Wait times can reach 2 hours in high season. You get about 5 minutes inside. Worth it if conditions align and crowds are manageable, but don't build your entire day around it — the Grotto is temperamental.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Monte Solaro Chairlift</h4>
          <p>Single-person chairlift to Capri's highest point (1,932 feet). Twelve-minute ride from Anacapri over gardens, cliffs, and increasingly spectacular views. 360-degree panorama at summit — Bay of Naples, Sorrento Peninsula, Vesuvius, Amalfi Coast, Faraglioni rocks, Ischia island. €12 round trip. Operating hours weather-dependent. Don't miss this — it's the island's most reliably magnificent experience. Bring layers; it's windier at the top.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">La Piazzetta (Piazza Umberto I)</h4>
          <p>Capri town's legendary central square — the living room of the Mediterranean jet set since the 1950s. Tiny plaza surrounded by cafés where espresso costs €8 but people-watching is priceless. This is where Jackie Kennedy sipped Campari, where Sophia Loren still occasionally appears, where dolce vita was perfected. Outrageously expensive, utterly charming, completely worth one overpriced drink just to absorb the atmosphere. Arrive at funicular top, turn left.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Gardens of Augustus (Giardini di Augusto)</h4>
          <p>Terraced botanical gardens on cliff edge with postcard views of the Faraglioni sea stacks and Via Krupp switchback road carved into the cliff. Flowering pergolas, Mediterranean flora, strategically placed benches for contemplation. €1 entry. From La Piazzetta, 10-minute walk via Via Vittorio Emanuele and Via Matteotti. Connects to famous Via Krupp (currently closed to foot traffic but visible from gardens). Allow 30-45 minutes.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Faraglioni Rocks</h4>
          <p>Three iconic limestone sea stacks rising 300+ feet from the water — Capri's geological signature. Stella (connected to island), Faraglione di Mezzo (with natural arch), and Faraglione di Fuori (outermost). Boat tours circle the stacks and pass through the arch. View from Gardens of Augustus or boat tour around island (€18-25, 1-hour trips from Marina Grande). Swimming near the stacks is a rite of passage for confident swimmers.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Villa San Michele (Anacapri)</h4>
          <p>Swedish doctor Axel Munthe's spectacular villa and gardens perched on cliff edge in Anacapri. Roman artifacts, classical sculpture, pergola walkway with jaw-dropping views toward Sorrento. The Sphinx terrace feels like the edge of the world. €10 entry. Reflective and beautiful. Bus to Anacapri from Capri town (€2.20), then 5-minute walk. Allow 1 hour minimum. Open daily April-October; limited winter hours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Via Camerelle</h4>
          <p>Capri town's luxury shopping street — Gucci, Prada, Hermès, Ferragamo, and artisan boutiques selling handmade sandals (Capri's leather sandals are legendary). Window shopping is free; actually shopping requires serious funds. The street itself is beautiful — narrow, whitewashed, flower-draped. Begins just off La Piazzetta. Even if you don't buy, the craftsmanship and style are worth observing.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Funicular:</strong> Marina Grande to Capri town (450 feet elevation) — 5 min ride, €2.20 one way. Runs every 15 min, 6:30am-9pm (extended in summer). First thing you'll use after tendering ashore.</li>
            <li><strong>Bus:</strong> Frequent service Capri town to Anacapri (€2.20); also serves Marina Piccola and other points. Can be crowded. Buy tickets at tobacco shops (tabacchi) before boarding.</li>
            <li><strong>Convertible Taxis:</strong> Iconic open-air taxis for island tours (€80-120/hour for up to 4 passengers). Fun for those who don't mind spending, but island is small enough to navigate independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Capri town is compact and pedestrian-friendly. Anacapri requires bus or taxi (20-minute drive, steep winding road). Comfortable shoes essential — island is vertical.</li>
            <li><strong>Boat Tours:</strong> Marina Grande operators offer island circumnavigation tours (1 hour, €18-25). See Faraglioni rocks, coastal caves, swimming stops. Book morning of departure.</li>

          <h3>Local Food &amp; Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Limoncello:</strong> Lemon liqueur invented on Capri using island's famous lemons. Served ice-cold as digestivo. Every shop sells it; quality varies. Try before buying.</li>
            <li><strong>Caprese Salad:</strong> Named for this island — fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil. Simple perfection. Order it where it was born.</li>
            <li><strong>Torta Caprese:</strong> Flourless chocolate almond cake, moist and rich. Invented here. Every café has its version. Pairs beautifully with espresso.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Marina Grande restaurants specialize — grilled fish, seafood pasta, octopus salad. Eat near the water for freshness and views.</li>
            <li><strong>Ravioli Capresi:</strong> Capri-style ravioli filled with caciotta cheese and marjoram. Regional specialty. Served with tomato sauce or simple butter and sage.</li>
            <li><strong>Granite:</strong> Italian ice dessert, often lemon or coffee. Perfect for cooling down after climbing the island's many stairs.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Blue Grotto closes frequently (rain, wind, high waves, rough seas). Don't plan your entire day around it. If it's open and waits are under 30 minutes, go. Otherwise, enjoy the island's many other wonders.</li>
            <li>First tender off gets less crowded Grotto and chairlift. Last tender off enjoys La Piazzetta at sunset when day-trippers depart. Choose your strategy.</li>
            <li>Monte Solaro chairlift is the island's most reliable wow moment. Weather permitting, prioritize this over the unpredictable Grotto.</li>
            <li>La Piazzetta café prices are absurd (€8 espresso, €15 spritz). You're paying for the setting. Budget accordingly or skip the square's cafés entirely.</li>
            <li>Boatmen at Blue Grotto may ask aggressively for tips. Tipping is optional but expected (~€2-5). Decide in advance to avoid awkwardness.</li>
            <li>Capri's famous handmade leather sandals (custom-fitted while you wait) make memorable souvenirs. Shops on Via Camerelle; expect €80-150.</li>
            <li>Bathrooms at Marina Grande are pay toilets (€1). Use ship facilities before tendering if possible.</li>
            <li>Wear comfortable walking shoes. Capri is beautiful but vertical — cobblestones, stairs, slopes everywhere. Fashion battles function here.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Do cruise ships dock at Capri?</strong><br/>A: No, Capri is a tender port. Ships anchor offshore; tender boats transport passengers to Marina Grande (20-30 min). Some itineraries dock in Sorrento or Naples with Capri as a hydrofoil excursion.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is the Blue Grotto worth it?</strong><br/>A: The blue light is genuinely spectacular, but waits can reach 2 hours for a 5-minute experience. It costs €18 and closes frequently due to weather. Go if conditions align, but don't sacrifice other experiences waiting for it.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to get to Capri town from Marina Grande?</strong><br/>A: Funicular railway — 5-minute ride, €2.20 one way, runs every 15 minutes. Far superior to buses or taxis. Station is steps from tender landing.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I see both Capri town and Anacapri in one day?</strong><br/>A: Yes, but it's rushed. Buses connect the two (€2.20, 20 min). For one day, I'd prioritize Capri town, La Piazzetta, Gardens of Augustus, then bus to Anacapri for Monte Solaro chairlift if time allows.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What if the weather is bad?</strong><br/>A: Tendering can be canceled if seas are rough. Blue Grotto closes at the slightest weather hiccup. Monte Solaro chairlift closes in high winds. La Piazzetta, shopping, and cafés remain delightful in any weather. Capri rewards flexibility.</p>
