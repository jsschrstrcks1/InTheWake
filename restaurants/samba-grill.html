  <h2>Booking & Pro Tips</h2>
  <ul class="bulleted">
    <li><strong>Go hungry, start light:</strong> Hit salads sparingly so you can focus on the rodizio stars.</li>
    <li><strong>Call your doneness:</strong> When picanha or lamb arrives, specify “medium-rare” and wait for the next slice if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Use the service disk:</strong> Green = keep meats coming; Red = pause. Don’t be shy — it controls your pacing.</li>
    <li><strong>Value play:</strong> If offered, the sea-day lunch is the budget win; dinner is the full show.</li>
    <li><strong>Pair smart:</strong> Caipirinha or a dry red works well; the Refreshment/Deluxe package can be a savings lever.</li>

  <h2>Our Review: Samba Grill on Allure of the Seas (2025)</h2>
  <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Samba Grill delivers a lively, value-forward take on the Brazilian steakhouse format with plenty of crowd-pleasing meats and a relaxed pace that suits cruise nights. Go in with realistic expectations — this is a fun rodizio, not a fine-dining steakhouse — and you’ll leave happy, full, and likely planning a return visit.</p>

  <p><strong>Setting & first impressions.</strong> Tucked away from Allure’s busiest corridors, Samba feels like a welcome exhale. Lighting is warm, tables are well-spaced, and the hum of conversation never completely drowns out the sizzle from the pass. Service starts at the buffet: a focused spread of salads, cheeses, and sides that’s more “solid support act” than headliner. A few bites of pão de queijo and a modest salad are all you need before the skewers begin to roll.</p>

  <p><strong>The meats — where Samba earns its stripes.</strong> Picanha is the cut to watch for: well-seasoned crust, clean beef flavor, and a juicy center when carved medium-rare. Ask your gaucho, and they’ll happily return when a fresh skewer is ready — the difference is noticeable. Fraldinha brings a looser grain and a punch of chimichurri; it’s flavorful, if a touch chewier by nature. The bacon-wrapped chicken is unapologetically indulgent: salty, smoky, and exactly the kind of bite that wins over teens and casual diners. Pork loin arrives rosy and aromatic with rosemary; the beef ribs, served in smaller carved chunks, lean rich and sticky. Lamb appears less frequently on busy evenings; when timed right, it’s tender with a mint-herb lift, but it’s the one cut where pacing matters most. If something lands past your preferred doneness, say so — staff are gracious about timing a better slice.</p>

  <p><strong>Buffet & sides.</strong> The antipasto lineup won’t outshine the meat, but it’s fresh and functional: a crisp Caesar, a pleasant Greek salad with briny feta, and a simple Caprese that works best when tomatoes are at their peak. Feijoada is a nice touch — hearty and lightly smoky — and pairs well with any of the beef cuts. Grilled vegetables and polenta give you texture and variety without weighing things down. Desserts are classic cruise comfort (flan, cheesecake, mousse). If you still have room, the flan is the best balance of flavor and portion.</p>

  <p><strong>Service & pacing.</strong> Samba uses a service disk (green to keep meats coming; red to pause), which makes it easy to control flow. On our visit, gauchos circled steadily without feeling rushed, and our server checked in often to target cuts we hadn’t seen yet. When the dining room filled, rarer meats did slow a bit; a quick ask brought the next skewer to our table within minutes. Drink service kept up — the caipirinha is bright, limey, and not overly sweet — and water refills were quietly efficient.</p>

  <p><strong>Value & comparisons.</strong> At <em>$34.99</em> for dinner, Samba undercuts most steakhouses at sea while offering a wider variety of proteins. The trade-off is precision: you’re not getting Chops-level searing on a single premium steak, but you are getting breadth — picanha, lamb, pork, chicken, ribs — and control over how much of each you want. With a 3-meal dining package, the effective cost drops further, making Samba one of the better “fill-up and have fun” specialty choices on Allure or Radiance. If you’ve done land-based rodizios, you’ll find the spirit intact, with cruise-scale adjustments.</p>

  <p><strong>Best way to dine.</strong> Book an earlier seating if you like faster rotations and hotter slices; later seatings feel livelier but can see more variance in doneness as skewers turn over. Start light at the buffet, call your doneness on arrival of each skewer, and use the disk to manage tempo. Two to three passes of favorites is plenty — you’ll appreciate dessert more if you stop one bite before full.</p>

  <p><strong>Verdict.</strong> Samba Grill is a spirited, social dinner that earns its cover with variety and generosity. It’s not trying to be a white-tablecloth temple to beef; it’s an upbeat Brazilian feast at sea. Go for the picanha and the vibe, stay for a second caipirinha, and roll out content.</p>

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0 / 5 — Excellent value and fun service; occasional overcooking and a basic buffet keep it from must-book status for purists, but it’s an easy recommendation for groups and package holders.</p>
