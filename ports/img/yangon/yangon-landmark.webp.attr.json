The building, located on the corner of Bo Aung Kyaw Street and Strand Road in Kyauktada Township, houses the central post office of Yangon.\nGeneral Post Office was built in 1908 by AC Martin &amp; Company, and housed the headquarters of Bulloch Brothers &amp; Company, a Scottish rice trading firm founded by James and George Bulloch. The company was liquidated in 1933, and was subsequently acquired and repurposed in 1936 by the colonial government as the general post office for Rangoon.",
