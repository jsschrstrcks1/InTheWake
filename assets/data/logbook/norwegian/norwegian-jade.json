The Greece I'd imagined\u2014white villages, quiet harbors, authentic tavernas\u2014existed only after the mega-ships left.\n\n[Norwegian Jade](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-jade.html) changed everything.\n\nAt 2,400 passengers, Jade visits Greek ports that larger vessels skip. We docked in harbors where the ship was the event, not one of three floating cities. Villagers waved. Restaurants had tables available. The Greece I'd imagined actually existed.\n\nIn Corfu, we walked through old town without following cruise ship crowds. In Katakolon, we accessed ancient Olympia without competing for space. In Santorini, we tendered to the caldera with hundreds, not thousands.\n\n'This is the Greece people describe,' my husband observed.\n\n'This is the Greece larger ships prevent,' I realized.\n\n**The truth:** Jade's size unlocks authentic Greek Island experiences. Smaller ship means smaller ports, smaller crowds, genuine destinations.\n\nI cruise Jade's Greek itineraries specifically now. The islands haven't changed.
