You might be ready if you can tolerate the idea of joy coexisting with grief, fear and hope can live together, you're booking for yourself not from pressure, and you can imagine sitting on a balcony and simply breathing. It may be too soon if you're in deep shock (typically first 3-6 months), can't imagine beauty without only pain, booking to escape responsibilities, or money is extremely tight."

Choose based on the day, not an identity. You can switch between them during the cruise. If someone asks about your spouse, you owe no one your story—use responses like 'Traveling solo this time' or 'They passed away.'"

Sit on aisles during shows, use 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. Crew see grieving passengers regularly and are trained to offer quiet help. Triggers aren't failure—triggers are love that still has weight."

Both, not one or the other. You are not betraying their memory by living—you are honoring them by carrying their memory into beauty."

You don't have to wear your grief as your identity. At sea, you can be just another passenger enjoying the sunset—or you can share with those who feel safe."
