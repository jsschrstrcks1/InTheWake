            <div class="logbook-entry__content">
              <p>
                The French arrived in Akaroa in 1840, just days too late—
                British sovereignty had been declared. But they stayed, and
                their influence persists in the street names (Rue Lavaud,
                Rue Jolie), the architecture, and a certain je ne sais quoi
                that makes this tiny South Island village feel transported
                from Normandy. Except the harbour is a flooded volcanic
                crater, the hills are implausibly green, and the wildlife
                is distinctly antipodean.
              </p>
              <p class="logbook-entry__highlight">
                Hector's dolphins—the world's smallest, found only in New
                Zealand waters—surfaced beside our boat in pairs and trios,
                their rounded dorsal fins unmistakable. They're curious
                creatures, approaching swimmers with apparent delight, rolling
                and playing in the wake. To share water with something so
                rare felt like a privilege; there are fewer than 10,000 left
                in the world.

            <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
            <p>
              Akaroa Harbour is a drowned volcanic crater providing sheltered
              anchorage. Cruise ships anchor mid-harbour and tender passengers
              to the main wharf in the village centre. Everything is walkable
              from the landing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Weather Note:</strong> The harbour entrance can funnel
              strong winds. Tendering may be delayed or cancelled in rough
              weather. The ship may relocate to Lyttelton (Christchurch) as
              backup.
            </p>

          <section class="port-section" id="attractions">
            <h2>What to Do</h2>
            <h3>Dolphin Encounters</h3>
            <p>
              The main attraction. Hector's dolphins live year-round in the
              harbour. Tours range from swimming with dolphins (weather and
              conditions permitting) to cruises that guarantee sightings.
              Black Cat Cruises and Akaroa Dolphins are the main operators.
              Book through ship excursions or in advance independently.
            </p>
            <h3>Village Walk</h3>
            <p>
              Akaroa village is charming and compact. French street names,
              colonial cottages, craft galleries, and cafés line the waterfront.
              The Akaroa Museum covers Maori, French, and British settler history.
              St. Patrick's Church (1864) is the oldest Catholic church in
              the South Island.
            </p>
            <h3>Giants House</h3>
            <p>
              Eccentric private garden filled with mosaic sculptures, terraces,
              and art. Part gallery, part fantasy—worth the small entrance fee.
            </p>
            <h3>Banks Peninsula Walks</h3>
            <p>
              For active visitors, tracks lead to volcanic crater rim viewpoints.
              The Purple Peak walk offers harbour panoramas. Check conditions
              and time before committing—some walks require half-days.

            <h2>Christchurch Excursion</h2>
            <p>
              New Zealand's largest South Island city is about 1.5 hours from
              Akaroa. Ship excursions visit:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Transitional Cathedral</strong>: The famous "Cardboard Cathedral" built after the 2011 earthquake.</li>
              <li><strong>Quake City</strong>: Museum documenting the earthquakes and recovery.</li>
              <li><strong>Botanic Gardens</strong>: Beautiful Victorian gardens along the Avon River.</li>
              <li><strong>Re:START Mall</strong>: Container shops that marked the city's renewal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The city remains in recovery but offers powerful stories of resilience.</p>

              <details class="faq-item"><summary>What if weather cancels tendering?</summary><p>Ships may relocate to Lyttelton (Christchurch) as backup. You'll visit Christchurch instead of Akaroa. Both are worthwhile.</p></details>
              <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why is there French influence here?</summary><p>French colonists arrived in 1840, shortly after British sovereignty was declared. They stayed and their descendants maintained French traditions, though Akaroa became British territory.</p></details>
