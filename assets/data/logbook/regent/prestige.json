[Seven Seas Explorer](/ships/regent/seven-seas-explorer.html) established the template. [Seven Seas Splendor](/ships/regent/seven-seas-splendor.html) and [Seven Seas Grandeur](/ships/regent/seven-seas-grandeur.html) refined it. Prestige will advance the evolution further.\n\nDesign improvements will address what Explorer Class experience revealed. Traffic patterns, venue proportions, suite layouts—every element will reflect accumulated learning.\n\nThe larger capacity enables features impossible at smaller scale. Expanded specialty dining. Enhanced entertainment spaces. More suite categories. Size becomes opportunity.\n\nFor design appreciation: Seven Seas Prestige will represent Regent's most ambitious design statement. The ship will define what ultra-luxury means for the next decade.",
