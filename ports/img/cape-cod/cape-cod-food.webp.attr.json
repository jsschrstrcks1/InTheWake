  "description": "NPS Collections: The Wampanoag called them ibimi, meaning \u201cbitter berry,\u201d and used them as food, medicine and dye. The Pilgrims branded them \u201ccraneberries,\u201d believing their flower, stem and petals to resemble the head, neck and bill of a crane. The historical record tells also of such obscure names as fenberry, mossberry and even bearberry. To us they are cranberries and their cultivation has been a mainstay of autumn on Cape Cod for centuries. This historic postcard shows cranberry pickers at work on a bog in Truro, c. 1900. Before the advent of mechanical harvesting in the 1940s, cranberry picking was a hard, labor-intensive process that relied upon the efficient use of hand tools, namely a scoop (or rake) and a snapping machine. Throughout the early 20th century, much of the manual labor on cranberry bogs was done by Cape Verdean immigrants and their descendants, some of whom appear in the scene above.\n<ul><li>Keywords: history; nps collections; black and white; collections; cranberry pickers; harvest</li></ul>",
