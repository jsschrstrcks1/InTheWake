          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship into tropical air thick with humidity and the scent of the Guayas River—brown and muddy, carrying the sediment of the Andes down toward the Pacific. The port at Puerto Marítimo was industrial and utilitarian, a far cry from the polished cruise terminals of the Caribbean. However, this is South America, unvarnished and real, and I felt immediately that I had arrived somewhere authentic. A taxi driver named Carlos offered his services, and within minutes we were weaving through the chaotic streets of Ecuador's largest city, horns honking, street vendors calling out their wares, life spilling onto every corner.</p>

            <p>Guayaquil surprised me. The city has transformed itself over the past two decades, turning a neglected waterfront into the magnificent Malecón 2000—a two-mile promenade along the river lined with gardens, monuments, playgrounds, and markets. I walked the length of it as morning light turned the river to gold, watching joggers and families and couples strolling hand in hand. The Moorish clock tower at the end, surrounded by fountains and palms, looked like something transplanted from another century. Yet it was the iguanas that stopped me in my tracks—giant green iguanas lounging on every bench and pathway, completely unbothered by the humans walking past. This is a city where prehistoric-looking creatures sunbathe in urban parks, and nobody thinks it strange.</p>

            <p>Las Peñas, the colonial neighborhood clinging to Santa Ana Hill, stole my heart completely. I climbed the 444 painted steps, each one a different color, past art galleries and cafés and houses that have stood since the 1800s. Halfway up I stopped to catch my breath and turned to look at the city spread below—red rooftops, green palms, the brown ribbon of the river, and beyond it all the distant shimmer of the Pacific. At the top, a lighthouse and chapel offered panoramic views that seemed to take in half of Ecuador. Tears pricked my eyes unexpectedly—not from the climb but from the beauty of this working city that has fought so hard to reinvent itself.</p>

            <p>Lunch came at a restaurant overlooking the river—ceviche de camarón, raw shrimp cured in lime juice with red onion and cilantro, served with crunchy corn kernels and sweet plantain chips. The flavors were electric: tart and fresh and spicy, the shrimp so fresh they must have been swimming that morning. Around me, Ecuadorian families celebrated Sunday lunch with plates of encebollado (fish soup with onion) and arroz con menestra (rice with lentils). The sounds of Spanish conversation mixed with cumbia music from a nearby speaker. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected feast, this immersion in a culture so vibrant and generous.</p>

            <p>Yet it was the Iguana Park—officially Seminario Park—that I will remember longest. Hundreds of land iguanas of all sizes live in this small plaza beside the ornate Metropolitan Cathedral, descendants of iguanas brought here decades ago. I sat on a bench and watched them climb trees and sun themselves on statues and waddle across pathways with complete impunity. Children fed them bits of lettuce while parents took photographs. A large male with an orange crest climbed onto the bench beside me and regarded me with ancient, unblinking eyes. We sat together for a long moment, this creature and I, two species sharing a bench in a South American city, and I thought about how strange and wonderful travel can be.</p>

            <p>The afternoon took me to the MAAC museum, where pre-Columbian artifacts told stories of civilizations that flourished here long before the Spanish arrived. Gold ornaments, ceramic vessels, stone carvings—evidence of cultures as sophisticated as anything in Europe at the time. I learned about the Valdivia people who created some of the oldest pottery in the Americas, about the Manteño who traded up and down the Pacific coast in balsa rafts. This land has been home to humans for ten thousand years. Guayaquil is just the latest chapter in a very long story.</p>

            <p>This is what Guayaquil taught me: that cities can reinvent themselves, that beauty can emerge from determination and hard work. Twenty years ago, the waterfront was dangerous and neglected; now families stroll safely under palm trees while iguanas doze in the sun. I learned that South America offers something the Caribbean cannot—the pulse of real cities with real problems and real triumphs, places that haven't been polished for tourists but welcome them anyway with genuine warmth.</p>

            <p>I felt blessed and privileged to have discovered this complicated, beautiful city. The taxi back to the port passed through neighborhoods rich and poor, past churches and markets and schools letting out for the day. Carlos told me about his children, about his hopes for Ecuador, about how much the city has changed in his lifetime. I climbed back aboard the ship as the sun set over the Guayas River, carrying with me the taste of ceviche, the image of that iguana's ancient eyes, and a deeper understanding of what it means to be a city reborn.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at Puerto Marítimo, Guayaquil's commercial port on the Guayas River. The terminal area is industrial and functional rather than tourist-oriented. Taxi services and organized excursions meet arriving ships, but there's nothing within walking distance of the port itself. Plan to use transportation to reach the city center.</p>

            <p>The city center is about 20-30 minutes from the port by taxi, depending on traffic. The main attractions—Malecón 2000, Iguana Park, and Las Peñas—are all within walking distance of each other once you reach downtown. Guayaquil is Ecuador's largest city (population 3+ million), so traffic can be heavy, especially during rush hours.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Walking Malecón 2000 and visiting Iguana Park requires minimal effort. Climbing the 444 steps to the top of Las Peñas is moderately strenuous—take breaks and bring water. The city center is generally flat and walkable. Wheelchair users will find Malecón 2000 fully accessible; Las Peñas is not wheelchair accessible due to stairs. Budget 6-8 hours for a satisfying exploration of the main attractions.</p>

        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> The primary option for cruise visitors. Licensed yellow taxis are safe and abundant. Negotiate fares before entering—expect $15-25 from port to city center. Full-day taxi tours ($60-100) offer convenience and local knowledge. Some drivers speak English; Spanish phrases help. Always confirm the price before departing.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer city tours, Las Peñas visits, and combination packages ($50-120). Going <strong>independent</strong> by taxi is straightforward and often cheaper. <strong>Book ahead</strong> only necessary for specific tours beyond the city. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, confirm return timing with your taxi driver or use ship tours.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Once in the city center, the main attractions are within walking distance of each other. Malecón 2000, Iguana Park, and the base of Las Peñas are all within a 15-minute walk. The area is generally safe during daylight hours.</p>

            <p><strong>Metrovía:</strong> Guayaquil's bus rapid transit system is efficient and cheap ($0.30) but can be confusing for visitors and crowded during rush hours. Not recommended for cruise visitors with limited time.</p>

            <p><strong>Uber/Cabify:</strong> Ride-sharing apps work in Guayaquil and can be more convenient than street taxis. Prices are comparable or slightly cheaper. Useful for getting back to the port.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Malecón 2000 is fully accessible with smooth paved surfaces and ramps. Iguana Park is accessible. Las Peñas involves 444 stairs and is not wheelchair accessible. Downtown sidewalks can be uneven. Most museums have accessibility features. Consider ship excursions that specify accessibility options for mobility-impaired visitors.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Guayaquil's attractions are concentrated in the city center and easily accessible. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> provide convenience and English-speaking guides. Going <strong>independent</strong> by taxi is straightforward and allows flexibility. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for specialized tours to cacao farms or mangrove reserves.</p>

            <h3>Malecón 2000</h3>
            <p>Guayaquil's crown jewel—a two-mile waterfront promenade transformed from dangerous neglect into a beautiful public space. Gardens, fountains, monuments, playgrounds, and markets line the Guayas River. The Moorish clock tower (La Rotonda) is the iconic landmark. Free access. Food vendors and restaurants throughout. Allow 1-2 hours for a leisurely walk. Best in morning or late afternoon when temperatures are cooler. Safe and family-friendly.</p>

            <h3>Las Peñas</h3>
            <p>The historic colonial neighborhood climbing Santa Ana Hill. Climb 444 colorful painted steps past art galleries, cafés, and restored 19th-century houses. At the summit: a lighthouse, chapel, and panoramic views of the city, river, and Pacific. Free access. The climb takes 20-30 minutes at a moderate pace—take breaks and bring water. Best in morning before the heat. Allow 1.5-2 hours including descent. Not accessible for wheelchairs or those with mobility issues.</p>

            <h3>Iguana Park (Seminario Park)</h3>
            <p>A small plaza beside the Metropolitan Cathedral where hundreds of land iguanas roam freely. The iguanas are accustomed to humans and often approach hoping for lettuce. Children can feed them (vendors sell lettuce). The adjacent cathedral is worth a visit. Free access. Allow 30-45 minutes. Best combined with Malecón 2000 (5-minute walk). Unique photo opportunities with these prehistoric-looking creatures.</p>

            <h3>MAAC Museum</h3>
            <p>The Anthropological and Contemporary Art Museum at the northern end of Malecón 2000. Excellent collection of pre-Columbian artifacts including gold work, ceramics, and textiles from ancient Ecuadorian cultures. Contemporary art galleries upstairs. Free admission. Allow 1-2 hours. Air-conditioned—a welcome break from the heat. English information available. Essential for understanding Ecuador's deep cultural roots.</p>

            <h3>Cacao Farm Tours</h3>
            <p>Ecuador produces some of the world's finest cacao. Day trips to cacao farms in the surrounding countryside offer tours of the cultivation and processing. Tastings of different chocolate varieties included. Ship excursions ($80-150) or arrange through local operators. Full-day experience (6-8 hours). Must be booked in advance. Fascinating for chocolate enthusiasts and those interested in sustainable agriculture.</p>

            <h3>Cerro Blanco Reserve</h3>
            <p>Protected tropical dry forest 15km west of the city. Hiking trails through forest that once covered much of the coastal region. Wildlife includes howler monkeys, peccaries, and over 200 bird species. Guided tours required ($15-25). Allow half-day including transport. Moderate hiking required. Ship excursions ($70-100) available. Best for nature enthusiasts and birdwatchers seeking alternatives to urban attractions.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> US Dollar (USD). Ecuador adopted the dollar in 2000, making transactions simple for American visitors. Credit cards accepted at major establishments. ATMs dispense dollars. Small vendors and taxis prefer cash. Prices are generally lower than in the US.</p>

            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Spanish is the official language. English is limited outside hotels and tour agencies. Basic Spanish phrases are helpful: "gracias" (thank you), "por favor" (please), "cuánto cuesta" (how much). Translation apps work well.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Tropical climate with wet season December-May and dry season June-November. Temperatures 25-32°C (77-90°F) year-round with high humidity. Morning often starts overcast, clearing by midday. Bring sunscreen, hat, and water regardless of season.</p>

            <p><strong>Food & Drink:</strong> Ceviche de camarón (shrimp ceviche, $6-12) is the signature dish—fresh and tangy. Encebollado (fish soup, $4-8) is local comfort food. Arroz con menestra (rice with lentils and meat, $5-10) is hearty and filling. Patacones (fried plantain chips) accompany most meals. Fresh tropical fruit juices ($1-3) are everywhere. Local beer Pilsener ($2-4) is refreshing in the heat.</p>

            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> 10% service charge often included at restaurants. Additional tips appreciated but not expected. Tip taxi drivers and guides $2-5 for good service. Hotel porters $1 per bag.</p>

            <p><strong>Safety:</strong> Guayaquil has improved dramatically but standard urban precautions apply. Stay in tourist areas during daylight. Don't display expensive jewelry or electronics. Use licensed taxis or ride-sharing apps. The Malecón and Las Peñas are safe and well-patrolled.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What currency does Guayaquil use?</strong><br />
            A: US Dollar (USD). Ecuador adopted the dollar in 2000, making transactions easy for American visitors. No currency exchange needed.</p>
