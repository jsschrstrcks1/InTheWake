      "markdown": "**I'm not easily impressed by cruise ship tech. Robot bartenders? Gimmick. Virtual balconies? Fine, but not transformative. Apps for everything? Annoying when they glitch.**\n\nBut Two70 on Anthem delivered something genuinely special that completely changed my perspective on what cruise entertainment could be.\n\nIt's a two-story venue at the aft of the ship. During the day: floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning ocean views. Perfect for reading, coffee, quiet conversation with new friends. At night: those windows become massive video screens. Robotic screens descend from the ceiling. The entire space transforms into a multimedia theater unlike anything I've experienced on land or sea.\n\nThe shows blend live performers—dancers, aerialists, musicians—with video projections that cover walls and ceiling, and choreography that uses the entire space. It's genuinely immersive without being gimmicky. Theatrical without being cheesy. Every show we attended left the audience genuinely impressed.\n\nI saw three different Two70 shows during my cruise. \"Spectra's Cabaret\" was the standout—live music, aerialists performing against shifting video backdrops, transitions that used the robotic screens to create depth and movement. My spouse (who hates cruise entertainment) leaned over mid-show: \"This is actually good.\"\n\nThe tech *serves* the performance instead of replacing it. That's rare on cruise ships, where innovation often means \"look what we can do\" instead of \"look what this enables.\"\n\nCompare Two70 to the Bionic Bar (robotic bartenders): the robots are fun to watch once, but the drinks aren't better. Two70's tech makes the shows *better*—you couldn't create those performances without the video walls and robotic screens.\n\nIf you sail Anthem, don't skip Two70. Book show reservations early through the app (seating fills fast). Arrive at least 10 minutes before showtime for good seats. And actually pay attention—this isn't background entertainment you half-watch while scrolling your phone.\n\nSee [other Quantum-class ships](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) for similar Two70 venues.",

      "markdown": "**My daughter was terrified of heights. At thirteen, she wouldn't climb a ladder.**\n\nSo when she announced she wanted to try RipCord by iFly on Anthem, my wife and I exchanged glances. \"Are you sure, honey?\" She wasn't sure. But she wanted to try anyway.\n\nRipCord is indoor skydiving—a vertical wind tunnel on the back of the ship. You wear a flight suit and goggles, and instructors teach you the basics: chin up, arms out, relax. Then you step into 100+ mph wind and... float. The first session is 60 seconds. Feels like 6.\n\nEmma almost backed out three times. In the line. In the briefing room. At the chamber door. Each time, she'd look at us, take a breath, and keep going. The instructors were patient. They'd seen nervous kids before and knew exactly how to encourage without pushing.\n\nShe stepped into that wind tunnel shaking.\n\nSixty seconds later, she came out grinning so hard she couldn't talk. The instructor had lifted her to the top of the chamber—thirty feet up—and she'd spread her arms like she was flying.\n\n\"Again,\" she said. \"I want to go again.\"\n\nWe booked two more sessions. By the third, she was doing spins. The same kid who wouldn't climb a ladder was doing aerial maneuvers with wind whipping her ponytail.\n\nThat moment—watching her transform from terrified to triumphant—is worth more than any waterslide or wave pool. It's the story we tell at family dinners. It's the story she'll tell her kids someday.\n\n**Practical notes:** RipCord fills up fast. Book your session the moment you board (go directly to the sports deck or use the app). Morning slots are less crowded. First-timers get a minute; return flyers can purchase longer sessions. There are weight and health restrictions—check Royal Caribbean's requirements before promising your kids.\n\nSee also: [SeaPlex](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) for bumper cars and roller skating.",

      "markdown": "**My husband thought twelve days was too long. Five consecutive sea days? \"We'll be bored,\" he said.**\n\nWe almost booked a standard Caribbean seven-nighter instead. Same ship, familiar ports, predictable rhythm. Safe choice.\n\nBut I'd always wanted to cross the Atlantic by ship. Something about that journey—the way travelers used to do it—felt meaningful. So I talked him into Southampton to Cape Liberty. Twelve nights. Five sea days in a row mid-voyage.\n\nThose five days changed us.\n\nWithout ports to rush toward, we slowed down. We actually read books—whole books, not just airplane chapters. We had dinner conversations that lasted two hours because nobody was checking excursion times. We discovered the Solarium at 6am was nearly empty and became our morning coffee spot. We learned the bartenders' names and they learned ours.\n\nDay three at sea, we hit weather. Not dangerous—just gray skies, choppy water, rain streaking the windows. On a port-heavy cruise, that's a disaster. On a transatlantic, it was cozy. We watched movies in the cabin, napped, had tea in the Schooner Bar while rain pelted the glass. Nowhere to be. Nothing to miss.\n\nBy day five, the rhythm had settled into us. Early wake-up. Solarium. Breakfast at [Cafe Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). Reading. Lunch. Afternoon trivia. Dinner. [Two70 show](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html). Nightcap. Sleep. Repeat.\n\nMy husband—the one who thought we'd be bored—asked on day seven: \"Can we do this again next year?\"\n\n**Why Anthem works for transatlantic:** The ship is mid-sized enough to feel navigable (you learn it in two days) but large enough to have variety. Two70 shows are excellent evening entertainment. The Solarium stays peaceful even on sea days. And the [North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) on a mid-Atlantic sunset is something you don't forget.\n\nTransatlantic sailings are often cheaper per night than standard cruises. They reposition the ship seasonally, so availability is limited. Book early if you find one.\n\nSee our [planning guide](/planning.html) for booking strategies.",

      "markdown": "**Margaret died eight months before I booked Anthem.**\n\nForty-two years married. Then suddenly: alone. Our kids kept saying \"get out of the house,\" but where? Everything reminded me of her. The grocery store where we shopped. The church we attended. Even the TV shows we watched together.\n\nI booked Anthem because Margaret had circled it in a cruise magazine. \"Look at that glass capsule,\" she'd said. \"I want to ride that.\" We never did.\n\nThe first three days, I ate alone at the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). The servers were kind, but pity is lonely company. I spent hours in [Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html), the venue with floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the ocean. Margaret would have loved it. I told her so, silently.\n\nI almost didn't book the [North Star](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/anthem-of-the-seas). \"For couples,\" I thought. But at 4am one night, insomnia won. I went to guest services and reserved the first morning slot—solo.\n\n300 feet above the ship. Glass capsule. Open ocean in every direction. Just me and the sunrise.\n\nAnd for the first time since Margaret died, I felt peace instead of absence. Not happiness—peace. The kind that comes from perspective, from realizing how vast the world is and how small our grief, even when it fills every room we enter back home.\n\nI rode the North Star three more times that cruise. Always alone. Always early morning. Each time, I told Margaret what I saw. The coastline. The clouds. The way the ocean changes color at dawn.\n\nI'm not healed. Healing isn't linear. But Anthem gave me something I needed: permission to grieve *and* to keep living. See [Cruising in the Wake of Grief](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html) for more on healing through travel.\n\n*If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 988 (US) or Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741.*",

      "markdown": "**I booked Anthem specifically for its solo traveler accommodations, and I wasn't disappointed.**\n\nThe Studio staterooms designed for single occupancy meant no paying double for an empty bed—a rarity in the cruise industry where solo travelers are often penalized. And the private Studio Lounge provided a gathering spot exclusively for fellow solo cruisers, creating instant community without awkward forced activities.\n\nMorning coffee in the Studio Lounge became my daily ritual. Fellow travelers shared port tips and became dinner companions naturally. One morning, a retired teacher from Canada invited me to join her trivia team. Another day, a photographer from Amsterdam and I planned a shore excursion together. The atmosphere was naturally social without the forced mixers some cruises push on singles.\n\nNorth Star at sunset became my personal meditation. Rising 300 feet above the ship, alone in the glass capsule, watching the horizon stretch endlessly—that solitude felt earned rather than lonely. The crew member operating the capsule noticed my camera and gave me extra time at the top, rotating slowly so I could capture every angle. Small kindness, lasting memory.\n\nDynamic Dining worked perfectly for solo travelers. No assigned tables meant flexibility—some nights I joined newly made friends from the Studio Lounge, others I dined alone with a book at Wonderland or Jamie's Italian, perfectly content with my own company.\n\nThe FlowRider had no single-rider stigma. Neither did the bumper cars in SeaPlex. I tried things I'd have skipped with a partner—the Bionic Bar for novelty, the Royal Theater for Broadway shows, North Star multiple times just because I could.\n\nAnthem showed me solo cruising isn't about being alone. It's about choosing when to connect and when to retreat. Both options exist here without judgment, without explanation needed. That's the gift Quantum-class ships give solo travelers.\n\nSee our [solo cruising guide](/solo/why-i-started-solo-cruising.html) for more tips.",

Everyone doubted the plan would work.**\n\nMy mother insisted she'd be bored. My teenagers insisted they'd be stuck with old people. My seven-year-old just wanted to know if there were waterslides. Planning a vacation that satisfied everyone seemed impossible.\n\nThe ship's variety saved us—and then some.\n\nGrandparents claimed the [Solarium](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) as their peaceful domain—adults only, climate controlled, comfortable loungers with panoramic ocean views. They read books there while the rest of us wore ourselves out. Mom finished three novels that week, more than she'd read in the previous year.\n\nTeens dominated the FlowRider surfing simulator and SeaPlex, where bumper cars and roller skating kept them occupied for hours. They'd disappear after breakfast and reappear at dinner, sunburned and exhausted in the best possible way.\n\nFamily dinners united us nightly. Dynamic Dining meant flexibility—some nights all twelve at one long table, sharing stories about the day. Other nights we split by interest. Kids wanted burgers at Johnny Rockets while adults preferred specialty dining at [Wonderland](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html).\n\n[North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) became our multigenerational moment. All twelve of us booked the same session, three generations rising above the ocean together. My father-in-law, who rarely expresses emotion, quietly said: \"This is why we came.\" The photo from that ride sits framed in my parents' living room now.\n\nRipCord by iFly conquered my teenager's fear of heights. Watching her fly—literally fly—in that wind tunnel became the trip's defining memory. Even her younger brother, too small for RipCord, cheered from the observation deck, promising he'd do it \"when he's bigger.\" That promise became the trip's theme.\n\nMultigenerational cruising works when everyone has their own space to explore and return together for the shared moments that become lasting memories.

Two70's transforming entertainment. Technology that enhances rather than replaces connection. We read all the reviews, planned all the experiences, expected to be impressed by innovation.\n\nOur Grand Loft Suite provided the private retreat honeymoons require—two floors of space, floor-to-ceiling windows, a balcony where we watched the sunrise with room service coffee. We barely left that room some mornings, blissfully newlywed lazy in the best possible way.\n\nBut the unplanned moments defined our trip more than anything we'd researched.\n\nDiscovering [Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) at midnight, completely empty, the venue's glass walls reflecting stars and ship's wake. A crew member appeared with champagne: \"Honeymooners?\" We must have been obvious, holding hands and grinning at everything. He toasted our future and left us alone with the stars.\n\n[North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) at sunset felt obligatory until we experienced it. Rising 300 feet above the ocean, just the two of us in that glass capsule, the world reduced to water and sky and each other. Neither of us spoke. Neither of us needed to. The operator gave us an extra rotation, somehow knowing this was a moment, not just an attraction.\n\n[Wonderland](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) dinner challenged our palates with whimsy. Courses that changed color, presentations that surprised, conversation that flowed because the restaurant refused to let us be bored. We laughed more at that single dinner than we had in the entire stressful months of wedding planning.\n\nAnthem isn't the obvious honeymoon choice—no beach, no Caribbean warmth. But for couples who value experience over expectations, who want memories instead of postcards, this ship delivers genuine romance in unexpected places throughout the voyage.\n\nWe're already planning our anniversary return.

Digital menus that changed before I finished reading. Guest Services had a line of confused seniors asking the same questions I wanted to ask.\n\nThen I met Rodriguez at the tech desk. Patient beyond measure, he spent an hour teaching me the Royal iQ app. Not rushing, not condescending—just careful explanation until the logic clicked. \"You're doing great,\" he said, and meant it.\n\nBy day three, I understood what my grandchildren already knew.\n\nThe app meant no memorizing deck locations—maps showed exactly where to go and how to get there. No paper schedules to lose or forget in the cabin—everything stored digitally. No lines for dinner reservations—everything booked from my stateroom while I had morning coffee.\n\nThe [Solarium](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) became my sanctuary. Adults only, peaceful, with staff who remembered my coffee order by day two. I read four books that cruise—more than the previous year combined. The warmth through those glass walls, the gentle ship motion, the absolute quiet—it was heaven for someone who needed rest.\n\n[North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) terrified me initially. Three hundred feet in a glass capsule? At my age? But Rodriguez appeared at my elbow on day five: \"Shall I ride with you the first time?\" He did, pointing out landmarks, explaining the engineering, making height feel like privilege instead of threat.\n\nI understood why my grandchildren called it magical. And I booked three more rides before disembarkation.\n\nTechnology-forward ships aren't for \"young people.\" They're for anyone willing to learn.

Rising 300 feet above the ocean on a boom arm while the ship moves through waves requires precision engineering that rivaled anything I'd seen in service. I asked the operator about hydraulics, safety systems, failure modes. He answered every question thoroughly, clearly proud of his technology and happy to explain. We talked for twenty minutes about redundant systems and load calculations.\n\nThe bridge tour revealed similar excellence. Navigation systems integrated radar, GPS, and satellite data in ways that would have seemed science fiction during my service. Officers explained procedures with discipline I recognized—checklists, redundancies, protocols that left nothing to chance. These were clearly professionals, regardless of their civilian uniforms and cruise ship setting.\n\nI found fellow veterans throughout the voyage. We gathered at [Schooner Bar](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) evenings, sharing stories civilians couldn't follow. The crew included military from multiple nations—Royal Navy, Philippine Armed Forces, Israeli Defense Forces. We shared language beyond words—the way you carry yourself, the way you shake hands, the respect in small gestures.\n\nThe ship's organization impressed me most. Three thousand passengers, fifteen hundred crew, complex logistics executed flawlessly. Meals delivered on time. Events coordinated perfectly. Safety drills conducted with seriousness. This was a well-run operation that met military standards despite civilian clothes.\n\nThe captain's brief Veterans Day acknowledgment meant more than elaborate ceremonies would have. Simple recognition that some passengers had served. Exactly right.\n\nWe're booking again next year. My wife was right, as usual.
