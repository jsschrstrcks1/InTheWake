    <article class="card"><h1>Taipei (Keelung): Where Night Markets Meet Mountain Temples</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The first thing that struck me about arriving in Keelung wasn't the port itself — it was the warm drizzle (they call this the "rainy port" for good reason) and the immediate, overwhelming kindness of every single person I encountered. Taiwan has a reputation as one of Asia's friendliest destinations, and after spending a day exploring from Keelung to Taipei's night markets to the mountain village of Jiufen, I understood why cruisers consistently rank this port among their absolute favorites.</p>

        <p>Keelung sits about fifteen miles northeast of Taipei, founded originally by Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples long before the Spanish arrived in the early 17th century seeking a foothold in the Pacific spice trade. The Dutch followed, then the Qing Dynasty, and finally the Japanese in the late 19th century — each wave leaving its mark on Taiwan's layered identity. When the Treaty of Tientsin opened Keelung to international trade in 1858, the port became a vital outlet for coal and fragrant camphor, and the harbor that greeted our ship has been welcoming vessels ever since. Walking these streets, I felt the weight of that history — not oppressive, but alive, woven into temple incense and market chatter and the rain-slicked cobblestones of Jiufen's mountain alleys.</p>

        <p>What makes Keelung remarkable today isn't just its past but how seamlessly it blends history with hospitality. Step off the ship and within ten minutes you'll find yourself at Miaokou Night Market — the name means "temple entrance" — which grew organically around the Dianji Temple over generations. Locals swear it's Taiwan's finest night market, and after tasting the crab soup, the crispy fish paste tempura, and those curious "nutritious sandwiches" (a sweet-savory peanut pastry that defies easy description), I won't argue. Just beyond, Taipei offers Longshan Temple, founded in 1738 and dedicated to Guanyin, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy, though the worship here mingles Buddhist, Taoist, and folk deities in a way that feels less like confusion and more like embrace. I also learned about the Zhupu Altar, a sprawling temple complex tied to the Ghost Festival celebrated in the seventh lunar month — a time when the boundary between worlds grows thin and offerings are made to wandering spirits.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting in Jiufen's A-Mei Tea House — a century-old wooden structure clinging to the mountainside — watching rain trace patterns down red lanterns while I sipped oolong tea so fragrant it tasted like clouds and stone. This former mining village, with its steep alleys and Japanese-era architecture, fell silent after the gold ran out, becoming something like a ghost itself until tourism brought it back to life. The teahouse owner told me Studio Ghibli's animators visited here, and that the spirit-town in <em>Spirited Away</em> carries echoes of Jiufen's twilight charm. Below me, the East China Sea stretched gray and endless. Magic feels close in Taiwan.
        </div>

        <p>What surprised me most was the food — not just how extraordinary it tasted, but how generously it was offered, how the vendors at every market insisted I try samples, smiling through the language barrier with a warmth that needed no translation. Oyster omelets, stinky tofu that smelled alarming and tasted sublime, beef noodle soup so rich I dreamed about it for weeks, bubble tea served with genuine delight — Taiwan's food culture isn't about accolades or pretension. It's about connection, tradition, and the simple profound joy of sharing something delicious with a stranger. On my way back to the ship, I paused near the towering Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall — that grand blue-and-white monument standing sentinel over a vast square — and thought about how this island has always been a crossroads, a place where histories collide and somehow, miraculously, create something beautiful.</p>

      <!-- Getting Around -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Taiwan's public transportation is excellent and affordable.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Train to Taipei</h4>
        <p>Keelung Station is about 10 minutes from the port by taxi (NT$150-200 / $5-7). Frequent trains run to Taipei Main Station — the journey takes 45 minutes to 1 hour and costs about NT$60 ($2). Buy tickets at the station; trains run every 15-20 minutes. This is the most reliable option.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taipei MRT (Metro)</h4>
        <p>Once in Taipei, the MRT is spotless, efficient, and cheap. Get an EasyCard (rechargeable transit card) at any MRT station — it works on metro, buses, and even convenience stores. Fares run NT$20-50 ($0.65-$1.65).</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taxis</h4>
        <p>Metered and honest. Flag fall is NT$70 ($2.30), and a ride from port to Keelung train station costs about NT$150-200. To Jiufen: NT$400-500 ($13-16). Drivers rarely speak English, so have your destination written in Chinese characters.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Buses to Jiufen</h4>
        <p>Bus 788 or 1062 from Keelung Station to Jiufen Old Street takes about 30 minutes and costs NT$30-50 ($1-1.65). Buses run frequently. This is the budget-friendly option if you're comfortable with local transit.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Walking in Keelung</h4>
        <p>Miaokou Night Market is just 10-15 minutes on foot from the cruise terminal — one of the most convenient port-to-attraction walks in Asia. Zhongzheng Park (with the giant Guanyin statue) is also walkable.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Top Experiences -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What I'd do with limited time.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Jiufen Old Street</h4>
        <p>This mountain village 30 minutes from Keelung is absolutely enchanting — narrow stone staircases, red lanterns, ocean views, and historic teahouses. A-Mei Tea House is the most famous (said to inspire <em>Spirited Away</em>). Go early morning to avoid afternoon crowds. Don't miss taro balls and sweet potato desserts.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Miaokou Night Market (Keelung)</h4>
        <p>Just 10 minutes from the ship, this is one of Taiwan's most famous night markets. Must-tries: nutritional sandwich (a sweet peanut-pork pastry), crab soup, tempura, and bubble tea. Open afternoon through late evening. Expect crowds but amazing food.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Shilin Night Market (Taipei)</h4>
        <p>If you make it to Taipei, Shilin is the largest and most famous night market. Oyster omelets, stinky tofu, beef noodle soup, fried chicken, shaved ice — sensory overload in the best possible way. Take the MRT to Jiantan Station. Open evenings only.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Longshan Temple (Taipei)</h4>
        <p>One of Taiwan's oldest and most beautiful temples (built 1738). The ornate carvings, incense smoke, and devoted worshippers create an atmosphere of profound reverence. Free entry. Dress modestly. Take MRT to Longshan Temple Station.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taipei 101</h4>
        <p>Once the world's tallest building, this 508-meter tower offers stunning city views from the 89th floor observatory. Book tickets online to skip lines. Sunset timing is magical. Budget: NT$600 ($19) for adults.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">National Palace Museum (Taipei)</h4>
        <p>One of the world's greatest collections of Chinese art and artifacts — over 700,000 pieces spanning 8,000 years. The famous jade cabbage and meat-shaped stone are must-sees. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Take MRT to Shilin Station, then bus or taxi.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Zhongzheng Park (Keelung)</h4>
        <p>Hilltop park with a massive white Guanyin (Goddess of Mercy) statue overlooking Keelung harbor. The views are spectacular, and the 22.5-meter statue is impressive. Walkable from the cruise terminal (uphill), or take a short taxi ride.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taroko Gorge (Full-Day Excursion)</h4>
        <p>If your ship stays overnight or you're on a longer call, Taroko National Park's marble gorge is one of Taiwan's natural wonders — dramatic cliffs, temples carved into rock, turquoise rivers. It's 2-3 hours from Keelung, so this requires a full-day shore excursion through the ship or private tour.</p>

        <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Things I wish I'd known.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bring Cash:</strong> Night markets, street vendors, and small shops operate cash-only. ATMs are plentiful (7-Eleven and FamilyMart convenience stores have them). International cards work fine.</li>
          <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Keelung is called the "rainy port" for a reason — pack a light rain jacket or umbrella regardless of forecast. Weather changes quickly in the mountains.</li>
          <li><strong>Temple Etiquette:</strong> Remove hats, speak quietly, don't point feet at Buddha statues. It's fine to take photos unless signs prohibit it. Small donations are appreciated but not required.</li>
          <li><strong>Language Barrier:</strong> English is limited outside Taipei's tourist areas. Download Google Translate offline and have your destination written in Chinese characters. Taiwanese are incredibly patient and helpful despite the language gap.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> Not expected or customary in Taiwan. Service charges are sometimes included at nicer restaurants, but street food and taxis don't expect tips.</li>
          <li><strong>Sim Cards / WiFi:</strong> Free WiFi is common in Taipei MRT stations and convenience stores. If you need data, prepaid tourist SIM cards are available at the airport and some convenience stores.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation Apps:</strong> Download the Taiwan Railway app for train schedules. Google Maps works well for navigation. Uber isn't widely used — stick with metered taxis.</li>
          <li><strong>Return Time:</strong> Allow extra time to get back to the ship. Traffic between Taipei and Keelung can be unpredictable, especially late afternoon. Build in a 2-hour buffer if exploring Taipei.</li>
        </ul>

        A: Absolutely. Jiufen is only 30 minutes from Keelung port and offers stunning mountain views, historic teahouses, and charming lantern-lit streets. It's said to have inspired scenes in <em>Spirited Away</em>. Go early to beat the crowds.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should I eat at a Taipei night market?</strong><br/>
        A: Must-tries include stinky tofu (more delicious than it smells!), oyster omelet, beef noodle soup, bubble tea, scallion pancakes, and xiao long bao (soup dumplings). Don't miss fresh fruit smoothies and shaved ice desserts.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do I need cash or can I use credit cards in Taipei?</strong><br/>
        A: Carry cash for night markets, street vendors, and small shops. Many restaurants and department stores accept cards, but Taiwan is still largely cash-based. ATMs are plentiful and easy to use with international cards.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is the Keelung port walkable to the city center?</strong><br/>
        A: Yes! Keelung's Miaokou Night Market is just a 10-15 minute walk from the cruise terminal, making it one of the most convenient port-to-attraction experiences in Asia. The famous Zhongzheng Park is also within walking distance (uphill).</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Taiwan safe for cruise passengers?</strong><br/>
        A: Extremely safe. Taiwan has very low crime rates and is considered one of Asia's safest destinations. Solo travelers, including women, consistently report feeling very secure.</p>
