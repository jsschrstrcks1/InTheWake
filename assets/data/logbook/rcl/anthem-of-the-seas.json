      "markdown": "**Margaret died eight months before I booked Anthem.**\n\nForty-two years married. Then suddenly: alone. Our kids kept saying \"get out of the house,\" but where? Everything reminded me of her. The grocery store where we shopped. The church we attended. Even the TV shows we watched together.\n\nI booked Anthem because Margaret had circled it in a cruise magazine. \"Look at that glass capsule,\" she'd said. \"I want to ride that.\" We never did.\n\nThe first three days, I ate alone at the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). The servers were kind, but pity is lonely company. I spent hours in [Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html), the venue with floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the ocean. Margaret would have loved it.\n\nI almost didn't book the [North Star](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/anthem-of-the-seas). \"For couples,\" I thought. But at 4am one night, insomnia won. I went to guest services and reserved the first morning slot — solo.\n\n300 feet above the ship. Glass capsule. Open ocean in every direction. Just me and the sunrise.\n\nAnd for the first time since Margaret died, I felt peace instead of absence. Not happiness — peace. The kind that comes from perspective, from realizing how vast the world is and how small our grief, even when it fills every room.\n\nI rode the North Star three more times that cruise. Always alone. Always early morning. Each time, I told Margaret what I saw. The coastline. The clouds. The way the ocean changes color at dawn.\n\nI'm not healed. Healing isn't linear. But Anthem gave me something I needed: permission to grieve *and* to keep living. See our [solo after loss guide](/solo.html) and [widow/widower travel tips](/articles.html)."

      "core_insight": "Two70's multimedia shows justify Quantum-class tech in ways most cruise features don't",
      "markdown": "I'm not easily impressed by cruise ship tech. Robot bartenders? Gimmick. Virtual balconies? Fine, but not transformative. Apps for everything? Annoying when they glitch.\n\nBut Two70 on Anthem delivered.\n\nIt's a two-story venue at the aft of the ship. During the day: floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning ocean views. Perfect for reading, coffee, quiet conversation. At night: those windows become video screens. Robotic screens descend from the ceiling. The space transforms into a multimedia theater.\n\nThe shows blend live performers (dancers, aerialists, musicians), video projections that cover walls and ceiling, and choreography that uses the entire space. It's immersive without being gimmicky. Theatrical without being cheesy.\n\nI saw three different Two70 shows during my cruise. \"Spectra's Cabaret\" was the standout — live music, aerialists performing against shifting video backdrops, transitions that used the robotic screens to create depth and movement. My spouse (who hates cruise entertainment) leaned over mid-show: \"This is actually good.\"\n\nThe tech *serves* the performance instead of replacing it. That's rare on cruise ships, where innovation often means \"look what we can do\" instead of \"look what this enables.\"\n\nCompare Two70 to the Bionic Bar (robotic bartenders): the robots are fun to watch once, but the drinks aren't better. Two70's tech makes the shows *better*—you couldn't create those performances without the video walls and robotic screens.\n\nIf you sail Anthem, don't skip Two70. Book show reservations early (seating fills fast). Arrive 10 minutes before showtime for good seats. And actually pay attention—this isn't background entertainment you half-watch while scrolling your phone.\n\nSee [other Quantum-class ships](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) for similar Two70 venues: [Ovation](/ships/rcl/ovation-of-the-seas.html), [Spectrum](/ships/rcl/spectrum-of-the-seas.html), [Odyssey](/ships/rcl/odyssey-of-the-seas.html)."

      "persona_label": "Critical Assessment",
      "intended_reader": "Travelers who want honest flaws before booking",
      "core_insight": "Anthem's indoor Royal Esplanade and limited dining variety are real limitations compared to Oasis class",
      "markdown": "I've sailed Anthem twice (2019 and 2023). I'll probably sail it again. But it has flaws worth naming.\n\n**The Royal Esplanade is underwhelming.** It's an indoor promenade with shops, bars, and the Bionic Bar. Functional, but not atmospheric. If you've experienced [Central Park](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) on Oasis class — real trees, open air, sunlight — the Esplanade feels like a mall. I spend minimal time there beyond transiting to other decks.\n\n**Dining variety is adequate, not exciting.** [Main dining room](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), [Windjammer buffet](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html), Wonderland, Jamie's Italian, Solarium Bistro, Cafe Two70. That's fine for a seven-night cruise, but by day five I was repeating venues. [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) has 20+ restaurants. Anthem has maybe 10-12 depending on how you count.\n\n**The pool deck feels cramped.** Anthem holds about 4,180 guests. The pool deck isn't sized for everyone to be there simultaneously. On sunny sea days, finding a chair is challenging. The Solarium (adults-only) offers relief, but it also fills up. I've learned to claim pool chairs early (7am) or skip the pool entirely and use the Solarium.\n\n**Itineraries are often repositioning or less common routes.** Anthem typically sails from Southampton (UK), Cape Liberty (Bayonne, NJ), or does transatlantic crossings. If you're looking for standard Caribbean loops from Miami, Anthem usually isn't the option. That's not necessarily bad—I like unique itineraries—but it limits flexibility.\n\n**Virtual balconies are clever but not balconies.** If you're debating inside cabin with virtual balcony vs. actual balcony: get the real balcony if you can afford it. The virtual balcony is an 80-inch HD screen showing real-time ocean views. It's better than a blank wall. But it can't replicate stepping outside with coffee, feeling the breeze, hearing the waves. Manage expectations.\n\n**Why I'll sail Anthem again anyway:** Two70 shows. North Star. Ripcord skydiving simulator. Bumper cars. The itineraries I actually want (transatlantic, UK/Europe). And honestly? I know the ship well enough now that the flaws are predictable and manageable.\n\nSee [Quantum of the Seas](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) for similar class features and limitations."
