      <aside class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent, #c69); background: #fefcfd; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>A note from the author:</strong> Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake — gathered from charts I trust, checked against the wisdom of those who've dropped anchor here before me. I'll update this logbook once I've walked these shores and tested these waters firsthand.</p>
      </aside>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The first glimpse of Brunei from the ship's rail felt like discovering a secret. While Singapore and Kuala Lumpur shout their modernity from miles away, Bandar Seri Begawan whispers. The golden dome of the Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque caught the morning sun as we approached Muara Port, glowing against the green backdrop of Borneo's rainforest like something out of Arabian Nights transplanted to Southeast Asia. This tiny sultanate — one of the world's wealthiest nations per capita — doesn't advertise its riches with towers of glass and steel. Instead, it offers something rarer: tranquility, tradition, and the profound beauty of a culture that has chosen preservation over progress.</p>

        <p>What strikes you immediately about Brunei is what's missing. No honking traffic. No billboards screaming for attention. No bars or nightclubs (alcohol is prohibited under Islamic law). At first, I wondered if a day here would feel restrictive, even boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. Brunei's serenity is intentional, cultivated, and ultimately refreshing. After weeks of crowded Asian ports, the unhurried pace felt like a benediction — a chance to slow down and pay attention to details I usually rush past.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on a creaking wooden walkway in Kampong Ayer, watching an elderly woman tend potted orchids outside her stilted home while the call to prayer echoed across the water. The world's largest water village has been here for centuries — 30,000 people still living as their ancestors did, suspended above the Brunei River. In that moment, I understood that wealth isn't just about oil revenue and opulent mosques. Sometimes it's about maintaining connection to your past while the modern world rushes by.
        </div>

        <p>The contrast between Brunei's material wealth and its spiritual simplicity creates a fascinating tension. The Sultan of Brunei ranks among the world's richest individuals, yet the capital city feels more like an overgrown village than a metropolis. Mosques with Italian marble and 24-karat gold leaf sit minutes from traditional markets selling fresh fish and rambutan. It's a paradox that shouldn't work, yet somehow does — perhaps because underneath the gold and glamour lies a genuine commitment to Islamic values of community, hospitality, and stewardship.</p>

        <p>Don't come to Brunei expecting wild nightlife or shopping extravaganzas. Come instead to witness how an oil-rich Muslim nation has chosen to spend its wealth: on magnificent houses of worship, immaculate infrastructure, free education and healthcare for its citizens, and the preservation of its unique cultural heritage. Come for the hushed beauty of mosques reflected in still lagoons, for boat rides through mangrove forests, for the warmth of people who are genuinely pleased to share their peaceful corner of Borneo with curious visitors.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Ships tender to Muara Port or dock at Serasa Ferry Terminal (28 km from capital)</li>
          <li><strong>Distance to City:</strong> 30-45 minutes to Bandar Seri Begawan by taxi or organized transport</li>
          <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Usually yes — most ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to port</li>
          <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Brunei Dollar (BND), pegged 1:1 to Singapore Dollar (both accepted)</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> Malay official; English widely spoken, especially in tourist areas</li>
          <li><strong>Time Zone:</strong> BNT (UTC+8) — same as Singapore, Hong Kong, Manila</li>
          <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> Year-round cruising; February-April slightly drier; expect tropical heat and humidity</li>
          <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Prohibited — Brunei is a dry country; do not bring alcohol ashore</li>

      <!-- Getting Around -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around Brunei</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Small capital city, easily navigable with organized tours or taxis.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ship's Shore Excursions</h4>
        <p>Given the distance from port to city and limited public transport, many cruisers opt for ship-organized tours. These typically include the main mosques, Royal Regalia Museum, and Kampong Ayer water village. Efficient and hassle-free.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taxis</h4>
        <p>Available at the port but not metered — agree on price before departing. Expect to pay around BND 30-50 ($22-37 USD) for a round-trip taxi to the capital with waiting time. Drivers often offer informal tours.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Water Taxis</h4>
        <p>Once in Bandar Seri Begawan, water taxis ferry visitors to Kampong Ayer and around the river. Negotiate rates beforehand — BND 20-30 ($15-22) for an hour tour is typical. Incredibly atmospheric way to see the water village.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Buses</h4>
        <p>Brunei has a limited public bus system connecting the port to the capital, but schedules can be infrequent. Unless you're adventurous and time-rich, stick with taxis or organized tours for a cruise day visit.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Top Experiences -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What I'd do with limited time in Brunei.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque</h4>
        <p>Brunei's most iconic landmark — a stunning example of Islamic architecture completed in 1958. The golden dome, Italian marble, and perfectly manicured gardens create an oasis of serenity. The mosque's reflection in the surrounding lagoon is postcard-perfect. Dress modestly; non-Muslims welcome outside prayer times. Free entry.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kampong Ayer Water Village</h4>
        <p>The world's largest stilt settlement — a network of 42 villages housing over 30,000 people above the Brunei River. Wooden walkways connect homes, schools, mosques, and shops. Hire a water taxi for a tour; guides explain the history and daily life of this centuries-old community. Absolutely fascinating and unlike anywhere else.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Royal Regalia Museum</h4>
        <p>A treasure trove showcasing the Sultan's coronation regalia, royal chariot, crowns, and gifts from world leaders. The opulence is staggering — think gold, jewels, and ceremonial splendor. Air-conditioned, immaculate, and surprisingly moving in its display of national pride. Free admission, but dress respectfully.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque</h4>
        <p>Brunei's largest mosque, built in 1994 with 29 golden domes representing the 29th Sultan of Brunei. Even more impressive than Omar Ali Saifuddien in scale. The interior (visible only to Muslims) features Italian marble and handwoven carpets. Non-Muslims can admire the stunning exterior and gardens. Open outside prayer times; free.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tamu Kianggeh Market</h4>
        <p>Brunei's main open-air market along the Kianggeh River. Locals shop for fresh produce, fish, spices, and traditional handicrafts. The atmosphere is lively but not chaotic — very local, very authentic. Great place to try tropical fruits you've never heard of and interact with friendly vendors.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ulu Temburong National Park</h4>
        <p>For adventurous cruisers on longer stays: pristine primary rainforest accessible by longboat and canopy walkway. Birdwatching, wildlife spotting, and immersion in Borneo's incredible biodiversity. Requires a half-day or full-day excursion — check if your ship's schedule allows it. Absolutely worth it if you have time.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ambuyat:</strong> Brunei's national dish — a sticky, starchy paste made from sago palm, eaten with savory sauces. Acquired taste, but culturally significant.</li>
          <li><strong>Nasi Katok:</strong> The people's favorite — fried chicken, rice, and sambal sauce. Simple, delicious, and dirt-cheap (around BND 1).</li>
          <li><strong>Satay:</strong> Grilled meat skewers (chicken, beef) with peanut sauce. Found at markets and food stalls throughout the capital.</li>
          <li><strong>Kueh (Kuih):</strong> Colorful Malay cakes and sweets — sticky rice, coconut, palm sugar. Perfect afternoon snack with tea.</li>
          <li><strong>Fresh Tropical Fruits:</strong> Rambutan, mangosteen, durian, and starfruit at markets. Try something you've never tasted.</li>
          <li><strong>No Alcohol:</strong> Remember, Brunei is dry. Enjoy fresh juices, teh tarik (pulled tea), and excellent coffee instead.</li>

        <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Things I wish I'd known before visiting Brunei.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dress Modestly:</strong> Brunei is an Islamic sultanate. Cover shoulders and knees; women should bring a scarf to cover hair when entering mosques. Modest dress shows respect and will be appreciated.</li>
          <li><strong>No Alcohol:</strong> Absolutely do not bring alcohol ashore. It's illegal and penalties are severe. Non-Muslim visitors may import limited alcohol for private consumption, but it must be declared and is not worth the hassle for a day visit.</li>
          <li><strong>Prayer Times:</strong> Mosques close to visitors during the five daily prayers. Plan accordingly — prayer times vary but are roughly dawn, midday, mid-afternoon, sunset, and evening.</li>
          <li><strong>Friday:</strong> The Islamic holy day. Some businesses close or have limited hours Friday morning through early afternoon. Mosques are closed to tourists on Fridays.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash is Helpful:</strong> While credit cards are accepted in larger establishments, bring cash (BND or SGD) for markets, taxis, and small vendors.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> Not expected or required in Brunei. Service is provided as a matter of course, not for gratuity.</li>
          <li><strong>Heat & Humidity:</strong> Brunei is hot and humid year-round. Drink plenty of water, wear breathable clothing, and seek air-conditioned respite when needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect the Sultan:</strong> Bruneians revere their Sultan. Don't criticize the royal family or government. Photos of the Sultan appear everywhere — treat them with respect.</li>
        </ul>
