    <article class="card"><h1>Stavanger: Where Medieval Meets Modern</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>I'll confess something: I expected Stavanger to be just another Norwegian port, beautiful in that predictable Scandinavian way. Instead, stepping off the gangway onto cobblestones practically at the ship's shadow, I found myself in a city that's somehow both 900 years old and utterly contemporary. Norway's fourth-largest city – home to about 146,000 souls – wears its history like a well-loved wool sweater: comfortable, authentic, and still keeping out the North Sea wind.</p>

        <p>The story starts in 1125, when they consecrated Stavanger Cathedral. That makes this one of Norway's oldest cities, and you can still feel that medieval backbone in the narrow lanes and the way the harbor curves protectively around Vågen. For centuries, Stavanger was a fishing town, respectable but unremarkable, the kind of place where generations worked the same boats their grandfathers had worked.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/stavanger/stavanger-1.webp" alt="Stavanger harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Stavanger — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Stavanger&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>Then 1969 happened. They found oil in the North Sea, and Stavanger transformed almost overnight from a mid-sized fishing town into what Norwegians now call the "Oil Capital of Norway." The change could have destroyed the old town – I've seen it happen elsewhere, where money bulldozes history – but somehow Stavanger kept its soul. Walking through Gamle Stavanger, you understand why: 173 perfectly preserved white wooden houses from the 18th and 19th centuries, their walls climbing with roses in summer, their doorsteps claimed by contented cats. The winding cobblestoned streets lead past local craft shops where artisans still work with their hands, and Nordic art galleries that showcase everything from traditional landscapes to avant-garde installations.</p>

        <p>I spent my morning wandering those cobblestones, getting deliberately lost, finding my way by the smell of fresh bread from a bakery I never did locate. Then I stumbled onto Øvre Holmegate – a street that exploded in color like someone knocked over a paint cart. Every building wears a different bold hue: electric blue beside sunshine yellow beside deep rose. It's whimsical, almost defiant, as if the street itself is reminding you that oil money doesn't have to mean corporate gray.</p>

        <p>The Norwegian Petroleum Museum sits near the cruise terminal – close enough that I walked there in ten minutes, though the wind off Vågen made me grateful for my jacket. I'll be honest: I went in mainly to kill time before my fjord cruise. But the exhibits are surprisingly captivating, interactive displays that let you experience what it's like working on an offshore oil platform. You start to understand not just the engineering brilliance, but the sheer courage it takes to extract oil from beneath a sea that doesn't want to give up its secrets. The museum doesn't shy away from the environmental questions either, which I respected.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
        <img src="img/stavanger/stavanger-2.webp" alt="Stavanger waterfront" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Stavanger scenery — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Stavanger&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>But the real magic – the reason I'd return to Stavanger in a heartbeat – was the three-hour fjord cruise to Lysefjord. The boat departed right from the harbor, and as we motored out, our captain pointed out that Vågen Harbor holds Norway's largest collection of wooden buildings, their painted facades reflecting in the still water like an Impressionist painting come to life.</p>

        <p>Then the fjord began to reveal itself. Sheer granite walls rose on either side, so tall they create their own weather systems. We nosed into Vagabonds' Cave, where outlaws once hid from the king's men, the boat engine echoing off stone that's stood here since before humans had words. Waterfalls tumbled hundreds of meters down faces that seemed vertical enough to defy physics. And then, as we rounded a bend, there it was: Preikestolen. Pulpit Rock.</p>

        <p>At 604 meters – 1,982 feet if you're counting in American – Preikestolen hangs above Lysefjord like God's own diving board. The captain cut the engines and we drifted in silence, necks craned back. The cliff face is so sheer it looks impossible, like something from a fantasy film. And I suppose it is a film star now – Tom Cruise dangled from it in Mission Impossible: Fallout, doing whatever terrifying thing Tom Cruise does when he's not satisfied with mere mortality.</p>

        <p>More than 300,000 people hike to the top of Pulpit Rock every year. It's a moderate trek – four kilometers each way with about 350 meters of elevation gain – but here's the calculus on a cruise port day: you simply don't have time. The hike alone takes four to five hours, and that's before you factor in transportation to the trailhead. But from the boat, drifting below in perfect silence except for the waterfall roaring beside us? I actually whispered to my wife, "No way this is real." The view from below might be better anyway – you get the full drama of the cliff without the terror of peering over the edge.</p>

        <p>We spotted mountain goats on ledges that looked too narrow for a housecat, let alone a full-grown ungulate. The captain said they're born there, live there, die there, and never seem to fall. I envied their confidence even as I gripped the boat rail a little tighter.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Drifting in complete silence beneath Preikestolen while a single sunbeam broke through the clouds and lit the entire rock face like a theater spotlight. The waterfall beside us roared its ancient song, mist rising in veils. I found myself thinking about the cathedral they built here 900 years ago, and how the first worshippers must have looked at these same cliffs and understood why we need words like "sacred" and "eternal." Some places demand reverence, whether you're religious or not.

        <h3>Getting Around Stavanger</h3>
        <p>This is one of those ports where the cruise pier is literally a stone's throw from the city center – maybe a ten-minute amble through the harbor area, <span class="distance-fun">approximately 7 football fields, 27 blue whales in a row, or 586 emperor penguins stacked skyward</span>. You'll know you're getting close to Gamle Stavanger when the pavement gives way to cobblestones and the buildings start wearing their historic white paint like Sunday best.</p>

        <p>The Lysefjord cruise operators depart right from the waterfront near the cruise terminal – you can practically see the boats from your cabin porthole. The Norwegian Petroleum Museum is an easy walk along the harbor. For Pulpit Rock views, book the fjord cruise rather than attempting the hike; on a port day, the mathematics simply don't work in your favor. The colorful Øvre Holmegate street is about a fifteen-minute walk from the ship, or a quick taxi ride if you've already worn out your walking legs.</p>

        <p>Stavanger is eminently walkable, with good sidewalks and clear signage in both Norwegian and English. The city center is compact enough that you can see the main attractions on foot without needing public transport, though buses are available if you want to venture farther afield.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Layer for the fjord:</strong> The wind in Lysefjord can be fierce, funneled between those granite walls like nature's own wind tunnel. Even on a sunny day in port, bring a warm layer and windproof jacket for the boat. I watched tourists shivering in their summer clothes while locals smugly zipped up their Gore-Tex.</p>

        <p><strong>Book the fjord cruise early:</strong> The Lysefjord cruises are popular with cruise passengers for good reason – they fill up fast, especially during summer months. Book online before your cruise or grab a spot as soon as you get off the ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Pulpit Rock reality check:</strong> Yes, the hike to Preikestolen is spectacular. No, you can't do it on a port day unless you're willing to skip everything else and still risk missing your ship. The four-kilometer hike (each way) plus 350 meters of elevation gain takes most people four to five hours, and that doesn't include transport time to and from the trailhead. From the boat below, you get the full drama without the time pressure.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency and cards:</strong> Norway is famously expensive and increasingly cashless. Credit cards are accepted everywhere, even for small purchases. If you need cash, ATMs are abundant near the harbor.</p>

        <p><strong>Gamle Stavanger's charm:</strong> The old town is at its loveliest in morning light, before tour groups arrive. If your ship docks early, grab a coffee and wander the cobblestones while cats are still stretching in doorways and locals are watering their window boxes.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Stavanger worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br/>
        A: Absolutely. It's the best fjord access you'll get without overnighting, combining dramatic natural beauty with genuine historic charm. The fact that you can walk off the ship directly into a medieval town and be on a fjord cruise within the hour makes it remarkably efficient for port days.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the single best thing to do in Stavanger?</strong><br/>
        A: The Lysefjord cruise to see Pulpit Rock from below. It's the perfect length for a port day (three to four hours), dramatically beautiful, and gives you perspective on the landscape that you simply can't get from the top of the cliff.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I hike to Pulpit Rock on a cruise port day?</strong><br/>
        A: Technically possible but not advisable. The hike alone takes four to five hours, plus you need transportation to the trailhead (about 45 minutes from the port). Unless you're prepared to skip everything else in Stavanger and accept the risk of cutting it close with your ship's departure, take the fjord cruise instead. The view from below is arguably more impressive anyway.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How far is the walk from the cruise terminal?</strong><br/>
        A: About ten minutes on foot to Gamle Stavanger and the harbor area. It's one of the most convenient cruise ports in Norway – you're essentially stepping off the ship into the historic center.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Stavanger expensive?</strong><br/>
        A: Yes, this is Norway. A simple lunch will cost more than you're used to paying, and beer prices might make you weep. Budget accordingly, or bring snacks from the ship. That said, the fjord cruise and the walk through Gamle Stavanger offer tremendous value for the experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like?</strong><br/>
        A: Unpredictable, like most of coastal Norway. Even in summer, be prepared for cool temperatures, wind, and the possibility of rain. The Norwegians have a saying: "There's no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing." Layer accordingly.</p>
