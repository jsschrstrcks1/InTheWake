While specific features await announcement, the class name suggests ambition. Previous \"star\" associations in cruising have carried connotations of navigation, guidance, and aspiration.\n\nWhat we can anticipate: Royal Caribbean doesn't create new classes without distinctive purpose. Each class serves specific market needs and guest preferences. Star Class will likely address an experience gap the existing fleet cannot fill.\n\nFor travelers watching fleet development: Star Class represents Royal Caribbean's commitment to continued innovation. The specifics will emerge\u2014but the ambition is clear.",

      "markdown": "**For cruise veterans who've sailed across Royal Caribbean's fleet, new class launches offer something increasingly rare: genuine novelty.**\n\nAfter you've experienced [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) neighborhoods, [Quantum class](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) technology, and [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) scale, each subsequent sailing within those classes delivers refinement rather than revelation.\n\nNew class launches reset that equation. Star Class will introduce design elements, venues, and experiences that don't exist anywhere in the current fleet. The learning curve returns. The discovery feeling returns.\n\nThis comes with trade-offs. First-of-class ships typically experience operational refinement during early sailings. Guest feedback shapes future improvements. Early adopters accept this uncertainty in exchange for experiencing something genuinely new.\n\nFor veterans seeking novelty: watch Star Class development closely. The inaugural sailing of a new class offers experiences that can't be replicated once the concept becomes familiar.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment. The best ships don't require comparison\u2014they end the search.",
