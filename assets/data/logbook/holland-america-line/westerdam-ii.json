I was thirty-four, recently divorced, and needed somewhere my heartbreak couldn't find me. The Caribbean seemed far enough.\n\nHolland America's atmosphere suited solo travelers particularly well.

We'd saved for two years. We had no idea if the investment was worth it.\n\nHolland America's premium atmosphere surprised us. My parents had expected floating resort; they found floating culture. The art throughout the ship. The lectures on Caribbean history. The service that felt European rather than American-casual. Dad, a retired professor, declared it 'the first vacation that didn't make me feel like I'd left my brain at home.'\n\nThe children\u2014ten and twelve\u2014had expected constant entertainment. They found something different: independence. The kids' program gave them activities while giving us freedom. We'd meet for dinner, share stories of our separate days, then scatter again. The ship accommodated all our different vacation definitions.\n\nMid-voyage, my mother fell ill\u2014nothing serious, but concerning for a woman in her sixties. The ship's doctor made cabin visits, adjusted her medication, and recommended foods that wouldn't aggravate her condition. The dining room staff delivered meals to her cabin without formal request. Dad could explore while knowing Mom was cared for.\n\nThe moment that converted my skeptical father came during an enrichment lecture on Dutch maritime history. The speaker connected Holland America's heritage to broader historical narratives Dad had studied for decades. Afterward, they spoke for an hour. Dad found intellectual companionship on vacation for the first time in his life.\n\nThe children declared the cruise 'better than Disney' because they'd had agency\u2014choosing activities, navigating the ship independently, feeling grown-up in ways theme parks couldn't provide.\n\n**The conversion:** Westerdam II transformed skeptics into advocates. All three generations found what they'd wanted from vacation without any generation compromising.\n\nWe cruised as a family every other year until my parents passed.

'I want to see places,' he said. 'I want experiences, not just relaxation.' The Caribbean cruise that visited seven islands in seven days seemed like the perfect compromise.\n\nHolland America's atmosphere set the romantic tone immediately. The Dutch elegance.

The sense that we weren't on a floating resort but on a floating neighborhood where everyone was celebrating something.\n\nThe crew noticed newlyweds with particular attention. Champagne appeared at unexpected moments. The dining room staff learned our anniversary would be our wedding day anniversary and prepared special desserts. The cabin steward created towel sculptures that grew more elaborate each day\u2014inside jokes we still reference decades later.\n\nThe islands provided variety that no single resort could match. St. Thomas for shopping. St. John for beaches. Cura\u00e7ao for Dutch architecture that reminded us of the ship's heritage.

Most surprisingly, the cruise director personally visited our cabin to discuss which activities could accommodate her condition and which excursions offered accessible alternatives.\n\nThe Panama Canal transit\u2014the voyage's highlight\u2014remained accessible. Crew members positioned her wheelchair at prime viewing locations. Fellow passengers made space without complaint. The engineering marvel we'd dreamed of seeing for decades unfolded before us despite her sudden limitation.\n\n'This is why we waited,' my wife said, watching locks lower us toward the Pacific. 'We waited until we had time to appreciate it properly.'\n\n**The timing:** Westerdam II proved that seventy-two wasn't too old for first cruises.

The industry had no accessibility standards then. Ships were built for walking passengers. I went anyway, prepared for disappointment.\n\nThe voyage began with honest limitation. My wheelchair couldn't fit through standard cabin doors. Accessible cabins were rare and expensive. Many public areas required steps I couldn't navigate. I'd known this before booking. I'd booked anyway because I was tired of assuming everything was impossible.\n\nHolland America's crew response surprised me. Where architecture failed, humans compensated. A crew member helped me transfer to regular chairs when my wheelchair couldn't reach venues. The dining staff repositioned furniture to accommodate my needs. The shore excursion team identified accessible options at each port and arranged transportation my chair could use.\n\nThe crew's ingenuity extended beyond basic assistance. One officer\u2014a practical man from Groningen\u2014noticed I was missing deck parties because my wheelchair couldn't reach the upper levels. He organized crew members to carry me, chair and all, up stairs to venues I'd resigned myself to skipping.\n\n'You're a passenger,' he said simply. 'You should see the ship.'\n\nMid-voyage, a wheel on my chair broke\u2014salt air and heavy use had stressed the mechanism. I faced mobility loss mid-cruise, the nightmare scenario. The ship's engineering team examined the chair, fabricated a replacement part, and had me mobile again within hours.\n\n'We fix things,' the chief engineer said. 'Chairs aren't that different from ship equipment.'\n\nThe ports presented challenges architecture couldn't solve. But the crew's research and relationships found solutions\u2014accessible beaches in some ports, vehicle modifications in others, alternatives when the ideal wasn't possible.\n\n**The proof:** Westerdam II demonstrated that accessible travel was possible before the industry made it mandatory. The ship's crew made it happen through determination when design hadn't caught up.\n\nI've cruised on modern ships with proper accessible cabins and universal design. They're easier.

I was forty-one, had never considered cruising, and booked because a travel agent persuaded me to try something different.\n\nThe industry was still defining itself in 1986. Mega-ships hadn't emerged yet. All-inclusive pricing was just becoming standard. The cruise experience we take for granted now was being invented as we sailed. Westerdam II represented Holland America's bet on premium positioning\u2014not the cheapest option, not the most luxurious, but the most sophisticated for middle-class Americans willing to stretch.\n\nFirst-timer orientation consumed the first evening. The cruise director explained tipping protocols, dining arrangements, shore excursion procedures\u2014information now standard but then revolutionary. Fellow passengers asked questions that revealed shared ignorance: 'Do we have to eat at assigned times?' 'Can we skip activities?' 'Is the ship safe?'\n\nThe revelation came through accumulated impressions. The cabin that seemed small became cozy. The dining room that seemed formal became comfortable. The activities that seemed scheduled became optional frameworks around genuine relaxation. By day three, I'd stopped consulting the daily schedule and started following inclination.\n\nMid-voyage, I made the rookie mistake of drinking too much at the sail-away party and missing dinner entirely. I woke mortified, certain I'd violated some crucial cruise etiquette. The steward who brought morning coffee just smiled. 'You're on vacation,' he said. 'That's what vacation means.'\n\nThe crew's patience with first-timer uncertainties impressed me most. They'd seen every mistake before. They responded with gentle correction rather than judgment.
