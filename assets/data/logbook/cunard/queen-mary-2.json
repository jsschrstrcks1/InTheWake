      "markdown": "**Queen Mary 2 is not a cruise ship. She is an ocean liner—the last one still in scheduled transatlantic service.**\n\nThe distinction matters profoundly. Cruise ships are built for warm-weather destinations, designed to encourage passengers outdoors. Ocean liners are built to cross oceans in any weather, designed to provide sanctuary from the North Atlantic's fury.\n\nQM2's hull is reinforced to handle waves that would damage ordinary cruise ships. Her bow rises higher than any competitor's. Her draft runs deeper. She was designed not to float between Caribbean ports but to cross the Atlantic in any season, delivering passengers from Southampton to New York as Cunard has done for 185 years.\n\nWhen you book a Transatlantic Crossing on QM2, you're not taking a cruise—you're participating in maritime tradition stretching back to Britannia in 1840. No flights. No intermediate ports. Just six days of ocean, exactly as travelers experienced before commercial aviation.\n\nFor travelers who understand what ocean liners meant: Queen Mary 2 is your only opportunity to experience it. She's not nostalgic recreation. She's continuation.",

      "markdown": "**I've cruised the Caribbean dozens of times. My first QM2 Transatlantic Crossing was different in ways I didn't expect.**\n\nNo ports mean no shore excursions. Six sea days demand self-entertainment. The realization hits around day two: you're in the middle of an ocean with nothing to do except what the ship provides.\n\nAnd QM2 provides magnificently.\n\nThe library holds 10,000 books—I read three. The Planetarium projects the same stars ancient mariners used for navigation. The lectures from Cunard Insights speakers covered everything from maritime history to astronomy. The Canyon Ranch Spa filled hours I didn't know I had.\n\nDinner became the day's anchor. Dress code mattered—two formal nights, elegant casual otherwise. The Britannia Restaurant felt like proper dining, not cruise ship feeding. Conversations developed over courses because nobody rushed to evening shows.\n\nBy day five, I understood what travelers in the 1930s knew: the crossing is the destination. The ocean becomes companion rather than obstacle. Time restructures around ship rhythms.\n\nFor travelers seeking escape: Transatlantic Crossing on QM2 delivers genuine disconnection. No ports to distract. No destinations to anticipate. Just ocean, ship, and transformation.",

      "markdown": "**People warned me Cunard was stuffy. They were wrong—but they were right that it's different.**\n\nYes, dress codes exist. Gala nights require formal wear—tuxedos or dark suits for men, gowns or cocktail dresses for women. But the formality isn't pretension. It's theater. It's transformation. It's becoming someone who dresses for dinner because dinner deserves it.\n\nI bought my first tuxedo for this cruise. Standing in front of the mirror on Gala Night One, wearing proper attire for the first time since my wedding, I felt... elevated. The man looking back wasn't someone who eats quickly and returns to screens. He was someone who dines.\n\nThe Queen's Room maintains formal atmosphere throughout the voyage. Afternoon tea arrives on proper china with proper sandwiches and proper service. Again: not stuffy, but deliberate. A choice to experience elegance that modern life rarely offers.\n\nCunard formality rewards rather than restricts. If you resist it, every dress code feels like imposition. If you embrace it, every dress code becomes permission to be your most refined self.\n\nFor first-timers nervous about Cunard expectations: bring the clothes, bring the attitude, discover that formal can feel liberating rather than constraining.",

      "markdown": "**We moved to London for work. Winston, our corgi, couldn't fly cargo. Queen Mary 2 saved our family.**\n\nQM2 maintains kennels on Deck 12—the only transatlantic passenger vessel allowing pets. The regulations are strict: UK-to-US sailings only (quarantine rules), advance veterinary certification, limited spaces that book months ahead.\n\nWinston's kennel was more comfortable than I expected. Climate-controlled, properly sized, maintained by dedicated staff. We visited four times daily—morning, midday, afternoon, evening—plus the outdoor exercise area on deck.\n\nThe kennel staff knew Winston's name by day two. They reported his meals, his mood, his behavior between our visits. The care was genuine, not perfunctory.\n\nWatching Winston explore the deck—salt air in his fur, Atlantic spray nearby—was worth every moment of logistics. He crossed an ocean on a ship, not terrified in a cargo hold. He arrived in America calm rather than traumatized.\n\nFor pet families relocating: QM2's kennels aren't luxury pet accommodations. They're humane transport for animals who matter too much for cargo holds. The experience costs more than flights. The peace of mind is priceless.",

      "markdown": "**At 151,400 gross tons, Queen Mary 2 was the largest ocean liner ever built. Her design serves purposes no cruise ship matches.**\n\nThe bow rises 75 feet from waterline to deck—necessary for North Atlantic waves that would breach lower profiles. The hull extends 23 feet deeper than typical cruise ships—providing stability in swells that would roll lesser vessels.\n\nFour diesel engines and two gas turbines generate 157,000 horsepower—enough to maintain schedule in conditions that force other ships to slow. The pod propulsion system provides maneuverability in New York Harbor that her size would otherwise prevent.\n\nIndoors, the design reflects crossing reality. Enclosed promenades allow walking regardless of weather. The Chart Room provides protected ocean viewing. Public spaces cluster toward the center where motion is minimal.\n\n[Queen Victoria](/ships/cunard/queen-victoria.html), [Queen Elizabeth](/ships/cunard/queen-elizabeth.html), and [Queen Anne](/ships/cunard/queen-anne.html) are lovely cruise ships. Queen Mary 2 is something else: a purpose-built ocean liner designed for a specific job. Every design choice reflects that purpose.\n\nFor design enthusiasts: QM2 rewards study. She's not oversized cruise ship but purpose-built tool for a demanding task. The engineering is elegant.",

      "markdown": "**I'd dreamed of crossing the Atlantic by ship for decades. When I finally booked, it seemed natural to go alone. Queen Mary 2 made that choice feel inspired rather than lonely.**\n\nSix sea days with no ports means complete immersion in shipboard life. For solo travelers, this could spell isolation. Cunard's structure prevented that entirely. Assigned dining times meant I knew when and where I'd find company. The daily programme offered lectures, activities, and gatherings. The framework supported connection without demanding it.\n\nMy table in Britannia Restaurant became my nightly salon. Eight strangers united by curiosity and good wine. We debated everything from politics to the ship's propulsion system. The conversations proved more stimulating than any I'd have found at home.\n\nThe library became my daytime sanctuary. Ten thousand books and fellow readers who understood that shared silence is its own intimacy. I finished three novels I'd been postponing for years, comfortable in leather chairs as the Atlantic rolled past.\n\nThe Cunard Insights lecture series gave my mind worthy challenges. Maritime historians, astronomers, authors—speakers who assumed intelligence and rewarded attention. I attended nearly every lecture, notebook in hand.\n\nAfternoon tea offered daily social anchor. The ritual gathered the ship in the Queen's Room, making it easy to join conversations or simply observe from elegant remove. By week's end, I recognized faces, exchanged greetings, felt part of a community.\n\nThe Planetarium captivated me. Lying back watching the same stars ancient mariners used for navigation, alone but surrounded by fellow explorers, I felt the crossing's magic.\n\nFor solo travelers: QM2's Transatlantic Crossing offers what independent travel rarely provides—structured community. You're alone when you want to be, accompanied when you seek company.",

The crossing became our marriage's first chapter.**\n\nQueens Grill suite living cocooned us completely. Butler service meant we could remain in our floating sanctuary—breakfast on the balcony, champagne whenever we wished, privacy whenever we wanted it. The Atlantic stretched in every direction, isolating us wonderfully from the world.\n\nGala nights gave us occasion to celebrate publicly. My husband in dinner jacket, me in wedding-adjacent gown, we felt like film stars from another era. Fellow passengers bought us champagne, offered toasts, shared stories of their own decades-long marriages. The celebration extended beyond our suite.\n\nSix sea days meant six days focused entirely on each other. No sightseeing obligations. No activity schedules. We could talk for hours without interruption, learning each other as we'd never had time to before. The ocean imposed stillness.\n\nThe Commodore Club became our evening ritual. Cocktails as the sun set into endless sea, planning the marriage we were beginning. Those conversations shaped everything that followed.\n\nThe ship's newspaper announced our wedding, and strangers congratulated us throughout the voyage. The crew appeared genuinely delighted—small touches appeared without request. The attention felt celebratory rather than intrusive.\n\nArriving in New York Harbor, seeing the Statue of Liberty together, beginning our American honeymoon having arrived by sea—that moment crystallized what we wanted our marriage to be. Not rushed. Not ordinary. Worth the journey.\n\nFor honeymooners: Queen Mary 2's crossing offers what no resort can—transition. You arrive somewhere different than where you started, transformed by the journey between.",

Six sea days mean no rushing to shore excursions, no early port arrivals demanding early waking. Each day unfolds gently—breakfast, perhaps a lecture, lunch, reading, tea, cocktails, dinner. The rhythm feels right.\n\nMy fellow passengers share my sensibilities. The crossing attracts people who value the journey, who understand that rushing defeats the purpose. Dinner conversations involve substance—history, culture, the mechanics of ocean travel. The demographic skews mature, creating community of peers.\n\nPhysical considerations are handled gracefully. The promenade deck provides gentle exercise—three laps makes a mile, properly dressed because Cunard standards apply even to morning walks. Elevators reach everywhere essential. Seating appears where needed.\n\nThe library contains ten thousand books, properly catalogued, properly cared for. I spent hours there with fellow readers who understood that shared silence is its own communion. The space honors literacy in ways modern life rarely does.\n\nAfternoon tea in the Queen's Room revived rituals I remembered from earlier voyages. White-gloved service. Proper china. Sandwiches without crusts. These ceremonies matter when you've lived long enough to appreciate them.\n\nThe medical center provided reassurance without intrusion. Knowing that serious facilities existed if needed, I relaxed into the voyage completely.\n\nArriving in New York as my grandparents did—by ship, approaching the city from the water—I felt connected to travel traditions that matter to me.\n\nFor mature travelers: Queen Mary 2 offers crossing as it should be—civilized, paced, honoring traditions worth preserving.",

Two years later, I finally did—and found the crossing helped me heal.**\n\nI'd worried about dining alone. The ship somehow knew—I was seated with a widow from Bath and a widower from Philadelphia. We became close during the crossing, bound by understanding that didn't require explanation.\n\nSix sea days provided time I desperately needed. No tours to join, no ports demanding attention. Just ocean, books, and gradual acceptance that life continues even when it shouldn't. The crossing's isolation became cocoon for grief.\n\nI visited places Edward and I had loved. The Commodore Club at sunset. The library where he'd read while I wrote letters. The promenade where we'd walked each morning. The memories hurt at first, then comforted, finally became treasures I could hold without crying.\n\nThe ship's structure helped enormously. Knowing when to dress for dinner, where to take tea, how the days would flow—Cunard's formality removed decisions that grief makes exhausting. The routine became scaffolding.\n\nCrew members remembered us. They offered condolences gently, shared memories of Edward, made me feel his absence was noticed and honored. The recognition meant everything.\n\nFellow passengers understood. Queen Mary 2 attracts travelers of a certain age, and many have experienced loss. We spoke of spouses who were gone, found that sharing kept them present.\n\nArriving in New York, seeing the skyline we'd watched together—I cried. But I also felt ready to continue. The crossing had done what crossings do: transported me from one state to another.\n\nFor those who've lost a partner: Queen Mary 2 offers time, structure, and community. The crossing won't heal grief, but it provides space for healing to begin.",
