You pay the same great price you’d see on Royal Caribbean’s site, and your clicks help keep our free research afloat.\\n\\n## Intro\\nBoarding at Port Canaveral with kids, grandparents, and a carry-on stuffed with chargers and snacks felt like herding cats through the atrium — until we stepped into Adventure of the Seas and the chaos turned to awe. Our multigenerational crew (teens, a grade-schooler, a toddler, and grandpa in a wheelchair) found a floating playground where every age got a win. **Price check (our price):** Inside came in around **~$759 pp**, and a Balcony for extended family closer to **~$1,079 pp** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\\n\\n*Book your family’s Adventure of the Seas* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\\n\\n## The Crew and Staff\\nFrom day one, bartenders remembered our sodas and lemonades, and room stewards learned nap schedules so the toddler could crash without the vacuum cameo. Porters handled the big bags landside; we rolled aboard light and happy. The way staff anticipated wheelchair moments — opening doors, guiding us to elevators without fuss — made the ship feel like it was designed for us. Smiles in the salty breeze, names learned fast, and patience that never ran dry.\\n\\n## Shows and Entertainment\\nStudio B’s ice show had our teens filming spins like sports highlights; “Can’t Stop the Rock” turned the theater into a sing-along. I face-planted on the FlowRider and got a sticky-soft-serve high-five from the nine-year-old next door. Arcade duels, promenade parades, and late-night pub singalongs meant somebody was always declaring it the *best day ever*.\\n\\n## Dining\\nWindjammer was our varsity buffet — tacos, salads, and kid-approved pasta — while **Chops Grille** delivered the “whoa” steaks. **Giovanni’s Table** became nonna-energy comfort. The Main Dining Room handled our one nut allergy cleanly, no drama. *Packing sanity saver:* our family list that kept cords, meds, and sippy-cup lids in line → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-dining\\n\\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\\nThe Royal app smoothed the whole thing — photos, docs, arrival time — and we were boarding smiles-first. In ports like Aruba and Curaçao we **walked down the gangway** straight into color-splashed streets.\\n\\n## The Real Talk\\nSea-day loungers fill early, and Wi-Fi can slow **far out to sea/peak usage**. Nothing show-stopping; it nudged us outside together.\\n\\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\\nElevators placed sensibly, theater companion seating, pool lifts ready when asked. One afternoon a crew member gently parked us near a hard-surface route so grandpa’s chair rolled easier. It wasn’t about special treatment — it was about dignity.\\n- **Elevator access** to all public decks → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/disability-at-sea.html\\n- **Pool/whirlpool lifts** on request\\n- **Accessible staterooms** with roll-in showers → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/ships/rcl/adventure-of-the-seas.html#accessible\\n- **Priority tendering** where applicable (most calls here were at a pier)\\n\\n## A Female Perspective\\nI felt respected everywhere — from the spa to late-night walks on the promenade. *Bring a light scarf*; the theater runs cool. Formal night ranged from glammed-up gowns to simple chic; no one stared either way. Making friends came easy in line for cappuccinos; the crew never made safety an afterthought.\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\nFrom toddler giggles to grandpa’s big-band sway, our week stitched together memories in every salty gust. *Summer dates go first — book now* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *Packing list we actually used* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\\n\\n---\\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons"

Room service set coffee and pastries outside at sunrise so I could wake to the Caribbean’s hush. No fuss, no pity, just professional sparkle.\\n\\n## Shows and Entertainment\\nIce show? Hypnotic. Theater production? Standing-O. Pub tunes, Boleros rhythms, poolside movies — I sampled everything like a tasting menu and loved not choosing.\\n\\n## Dining\\n**Chops Grille** for steak night, **Giovanni’s** for truffle pasta, **Izumi** for a playful detour — Unlimited Dining meant I simply said *yes*.

When a calendar ping tried to hijack my sea day, I smiled at the “Wi-Fi’s a little busy right now” energy and reclaimed the hour for the hot tub.\\n\\n## The Real Talk\\nLoungers go early and the promenade gets lively — I preferred shaded perches and off-peak laps. Wi-Fi slows **far out to sea/peak usage** — which is convenient when you need a meeting-dodging excuse.\\n\\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\\nI travel with intention. I watched crew clear pathways, guide wheelchairs to elevators, and set pool lifts with calm care.

Formal night ran the spectrum; I wore a sleek dress and felt perfectly at home. The spa facial + steam became my reset; I made two quick friends comparing earrings (yes, I bought the fire-opal pair from the boutique and regret nothing).\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\nSeven nights reminded me that joy can be scheduled — and savored. *Claim your week* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *My exact packing picks* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\\n\\n---\\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons"

Formal night? Some dressed to the nines; my simple dress and the kids’ clip-on ties fit right in. I found a quiet corner of the spa for a 30-minute reset and didn’t feel out of place for choosing the short option.\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\nThis trip was a lifeline — beauty in small moments, healing in sea air. *Grab your week while it’s there* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *What actually made our bag* → https://jsschrstrcks1.github.io/InTheWake/packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\\n\\n---\\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons"

Respect showed up in a hundred small ways.\\n\\n## Shows and Entertainment\\nIce show, theater, pub game on the big screen. I traded cocktail trees for water and didn’t miss a thing. One evening in the hot tub I met someone who saw *me*, not the chair.

A dining room team slipped a “Happy Retirement” flourish onto dessert one evening — not a big spectacle, just a sweet nod that made us feel seen.\\n\\n## Shows and Entertainment\\nWe fell for the ice show and any live band that played the songs we once danced to in college. Boleros rhythms, pub singalongs, and poolside movies gave us plenty to choose from; most nights we chose *each other* and talked late on the balcony like teenagers.\\n\\n## Dining\\nWe used a **3-night specialty package**: **Chops Grille** (perfect filet), **Giovanni’s** (truffle pasta), and **Izumi** for something playful.
