      <h2 id="logbookHeading">A Note from Ken’s Logbook — A Personal Review</h2>
      <p class="pill">Own Wake — Full disclosure: I have stood the watch on Grandeur of the Seas, for nine days logged in her logbook and mine. This is no tide of borrowed winds, but depth soundings taken in my own wake.</p>

      <div class="prose">
        <p>We sailed in an ocean-view stateroom, where every sunrise framed the horizon like a painting—coffee in hand, it was the best way to start the day. Grandeur is the cozy heart of Royal’s Vision-class: small enough to feel familiar, big enough to keep you entertained. On our 9-night Eastern Caribbean run to Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, and Labadee, she showed why smaller ships often win hearts — warmth, intimacy, and crew who treat you like family.</p>

        <h3>The Crew and Staff</h3>
        <p>The crew was the soul of this sailing. Our stateroom attendant kept everything shipshape, towel animals included. Vincent at Guest Services handled requests with a smile and speed that felt like chatting with an old friend. And in Windjammer, Vergel spotted that we’d left without our eggs; before we could even circle back, he brought them fresh to our table — a small kindness that said everything about Grandeur’s crew.</p>

        <h3>Shows and Entertainment</h3>
        <p>The Palladium Theatre might be intimate, but the energy was anything but small. <em>Tango Buenos Aires</em> lit up the stage with world-class dancing and passionate vocals. <em>Broadway Rhythm &amp; Rhyme</em> leaned on nostalgia, and though some costumes looked ready for retirement, the music carried the night. Around the ship, live bands, poolside calypso, and Schooner Bar sing-alongs made evenings feel alive — less like staged events, more like a floating neighborhood gathering.</p>

        <h3>Dining</h3>
        <p>Windjammer became our casual harbor, with omelet stations, jerk chicken, and a bagel breakfast (lox, cream cheese, bacon) that hit all the right notes. The Great Gatsby Dining Room set a more formal table, where our waiter’s recommendations (herb-crusted salmon, a chocolate torte) were perfect. And we made time for splurges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chops Grille:</strong> A filet so good it nearly had its own standing ovation, with truffle fries that disappeared almost instantly. Miguel, our waiter, had the timing of a captain easing into port.</li>
          <li><strong>Taste of Royal:</strong> The tuna tartare was bright and lively, the shrimp needed more kick, but the fried cheesecake? Worth writing home about. Reviews often call Chops the safe bet, Taste the creative wildcard — our experience matched that.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Embarkation &amp; Disembarkation</h3>
        <p>Fort Lauderdale was smooth sailing: on board before lunch, off with bags in hand by breakfast on the last day. Port parking is expensive; off-site plus a taxi saved us money without hassle.</p>

        <h3>The Real Talk</h3>
        <p>Grandeur’s age shows here and there — carpets with stories, deck furniture a little sun-tired. Wi-Fi is leisurely unless you pay for the upgrade. The pool deck has the classic “chair hog” problem, but Royal now posts signs: after 30 minutes unattended, crew will clear belongings if you ask. Our workaround? One family chair, everyone’s stuff piled there, with a rotation of sitters. It kept us fair, light-footed, and out of trouble with the towel station.</p>

        <h3>A Woman’s Perspective (My Mother’s Notes)</h3>
        <p>“I felt safe and comfortable wandering Grandeur solo, whether grabbing coffee at sunrise or snacks late at night. The crew’s watchful care made it feel like home. <em>Tango Buenos Aires</em> thrilled me, but I’ll warn: the theater gets chilly — bring a shawl. Chops Grille served a petit filet that was small but flawless, and Miguel’s warmth made the night. Smaller ships like Grandeur are my favorites; you get real connection, not just service.”</p>

        <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Grandeur doesn’t try to be the flashiest ship in the fleet — she doesn’t need to. She wins by being personal: crew who know your name, spaces that feel welcoming, and sunrises that remind you why you came to sea in the first place. For us, she delivered connection, care, and adventure. And yes, we’re already planning to sail her again.</p>
