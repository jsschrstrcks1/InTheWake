      <h3>La Reggia Restaurant Review: Royal Dining with Italian Grandeur</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> La Reggia ("The Royal Palace") is a complimentary main dining room found aboard MSC Divina and select sister ships. Named to evoke the grandeur of Italian royal courts, it's one of the ship's primary assigned-seating dinner venues serving MSC's rotating multi-course menu. It shares the same menu as the ship's other main dining rooms but distinguishes itself through its design — an opulent, Baroque-inspired space that makes every dinner feel like an occasion.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The menu follows the MSC fleet standard, which means Italian preparations are the kitchen's strength and your best ordering strategy. The penne all'arrabbiata has genuine kick and the right al dente bite. The gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream sauce is indulgent and surprisingly well-executed. The beef tenderloin, when available, arrives with proper sear and seasoning — one of the better main dining room steak offerings in the fleet. The seafood linguine delivers generous portions of mixed shellfish in a white wine garlic sauce. Where it falls short: non-Italian entrees continue MSC's fleet-wide pattern of mediocrity — the Asian-inspired dishes, curries, and fusion experiments lack the conviction of the Italian preparations. Soups are hit-or-miss, with some tasting watered-down. Desserts are strongest when they stay Italian: the cassata Siciliana and cannoli filling are authentic, while international options (chocolate mousse, fruit tart) feel processed. The wine list features solid Italian options at fair cruise-ship pricing.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The assigned-waiter system shines in La Reggia's formal setting. Your team learns your preferences quickly — drink orders arrive before you ask, dietary needs are remembered without reminders. The room's opulent design seems to elevate the service approach, with staff carrying themselves with slightly more formality than in the ship's other dining rooms. Pacing is well-managed for the first seating; the second can feel accelerated during high-demand nights.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>La Reggia is arguably the most visually striking complimentary dining room in the MSC fleet. The design draws from Italian palace aesthetics — gilded accents, dramatic chandeliers, sweeping staircases, and a color palette that channels Versailles-by-way-of-Naples. It photographs beautifully and makes Elegant Night genuinely feel elegant. The downside is acoustics: the high ceilings and hard surfaces amplify noise at full occupancy, making intimate conversation challenging at peak dinner hours. Upper-deck balcony seating is quieter and offers views of the room below.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> La Reggia is the main dining room to request if you value atmosphere and visual spectacle — the Baroque design makes nightly dinner feel special in a way few complimentary venues achieve. The Italian menu items deliver reliably, and the assigned service builds genuine rapport. It misses a higher mark because non-Italian dishes remain mediocre and the room's grandeur creates noise challenges at capacity. <em>Tip:</em> request upper-level balcony seating for a quieter experience with sweeping views of the dining room — it's the best complimentary table on the ship.</p>
