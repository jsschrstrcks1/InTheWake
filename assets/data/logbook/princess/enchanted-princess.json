      "markdown": "**Enchanted Princess was delivered in 2021, during cruising's most challenging period. Her existence represents remarkable industry resilience.**\n\nConstruction couldn't simply stop. The ship was being built at Fincantieri in Italy through 2020 and 2021, workers continuing while the world debated whether cruising would survive.\n\nPrincess took delivery of a ship without passengers to carry. Enchanted Princess waited, perfectly new, for an industry to restart. Her inaugural sailings came months after delivery—an unusual gap that marked an unusual era.\n\nFor passengers, this history creates advantages. The ship entered service with full technical capability, refined by lessons from sister ships. No inaugural-season bugs. No first-year adjustments. She launched polished.\n\nEnchanted Princess carries the memory of an industry that didn't surrender. Every sailing validates the workers who built her through uncertainty, the company that accepted her through doubt, the industry that believed cruising would return.\n\nShe sails now as proof. The pandemic delayed but didn't defeat. Cruising survived. Enchanted Princess is the evidence.",

      "markdown": "**Enchanted Princess sails Caribbean waters regularly, where her Royal Class design proves perfectly suited to warm-weather cruising.**\n\nThe outdoor spaces shine in Caribbean climate. Movies Under the Stars operates nightly under tropical skies. The SeaWalk glass walkway invites sunset strolls above Caribbean blue. The pools remain comfortable throughout each voyage.\n\nRoyal Class size navigates Caribbean ports efficiently. St. Thomas, Cozumel, Grand Cayman—these destinations handle 3,500 passengers without the congestion that mega-ships create. The experience ashore feels proportionate to the destinations.\n\nThe Piazza atrium provides air-conditioned refuge during hot port days. Return from shore excursions, settle into comfortable seating, order something cold. The transition from island heat to shipboard comfort happens smoothly.\n\nCaribbean itineraries range from quick getaways to extended explorations. Enchanted Princess serves both—short sailings from Florida homeports and longer voyages reaching deeper Caribbean destinations.\n\nFor Caribbean cruise priorities: Enchanted Princess delivers Royal Class refinement in waters where that refinement translates to excellent experience. The combination works.",

      "markdown": "**After sailing [Royal Princess](/ships/princess/royal-princess.html), [Regal Princess](/ships/princess/regal-princess.html), [Majestic Princess](/ships/princess/majestic-princess.html), and [Sky Princess](/ships/princess/sky-princess.html), we knew exactly what to expect from Enchanted Princess. She delivered.**\n\nRoyal Class ships share fundamentals. The Piazza atrium. The SeaWalk. Movies Under the Stars. MedallionClass technology. The venues differ in detail but not in quality. The experience transfers.\n\nThis consistency rewards loyalty. We know where to find quiet corners. We understand dining rhythms. We've mastered embarkation efficiency. Every Royal Class sailing builds on previous knowledge.\n\nEnchanted Princess specifically benefits from learning. She's the fifth of six Royal Class ships. The operational refinements accumulated through four predecessors appear in her execution. Traffic flows better. Programming is optimized.\n\nSome cruisers want novelty. We want reliability. We want to know that our favorite bar serves excellent drinks, that our preferred deck chair awaits, that the service maintains standards we've experienced before.\n\nEnchanted Princess delivers precisely this. Not surprising. Not experimental. Simply excellent in ways we've learned to trust. For veteran Princess cruisers, that consistency is the point.",
