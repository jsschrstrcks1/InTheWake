  "description": "<p>The Solent is a Mark IV flying boat and is the only one of its type left in the world. Solent flying boats are best known in New Zealand for delivering tourists along the \u2018Coral Route\u2019 to Fiji, Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga and Tahiti, but they were all withdrawn from service by September 1960.\n</p>\nThe Solent will undergo a special restoration and conservation project over the next 12 months while it is undercover in MOTAT\u2019s Aviation Display Hall.",
