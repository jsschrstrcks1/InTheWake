        <h1>Noumea: Where France Meets the Pacific</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Noumea is what happens when you drop a slice of southern France into the South Pacific and wait 170 years. The result is gloriously disorienting — croissants and café au lait served at sunrise over the world's largest lagoon, Kanak cultural centers next to French bistros, street signs in French pointing to beaches with Melanesian names. This is France's last significant Pacific territory, and it wears that identity with unmistakable pride. The tricolor flies everywhere. The bread is legitimately excellent. The locals argue about cheese with Parisian intensity.</p>

          <p>But step outside downtown and you remember you're in the tropics. The lagoon surrounding Grande Terre (the main island) is a UNESCO World Heritage site — 24,000 square kilometers of turquoise water so vivid it looks Photoshopped. The barrier reef is the second-longest in the world after Australia's. The sunshine hours exceed almost anywhere on Earth. The Kanak people were here for 3,000 years before the French arrived, and their culture threads through everything if you know where to look.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Climbing 247 steps to the top of Amedee Lighthouse, 45 minutes offshore by luxury yacht. The climb was steep, the iron stairs narrow, my legs protesting. But at the summit, the view silenced every complaint — the entire UNESCO lagoon spreading in every direction, water shifting through impossible shades of blue and green, the barrier reef a dark line at the horizon. Below, glass-bottom boats drifted over coral gardens. A sea turtle surfaced lazily. The lighthouse keeper built this in 1865. He must have stood here on mornings just like this, watching the same lagoon, feeling the same humility before so much beauty.
          </div>

          <p>The cruise terminal sits right in the heart of downtown on Ferry Wharf. You walk off the ship into the city — no shuttles, no tenders, no waiting. Five minutes and you're ordering pain au chocolat at a boulangerie. Ten minutes and you're catching a water taxi to Signal Island to swim with turtles. Noumea makes everything easy, which is fortunate because it's expensive. Everything is imported. A coffee costs what you'd pay in Paris. But the climate is perfect, the lagoon is otherworldly, and the cultural blend is found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
        </div>

            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> CFP Franc (XPF); credit cards widely accepted; ATMs available downtown</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> French (official); English spoken at tourist sites; Kanak languages among indigenous population</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side (French style); car rental available; roads well-maintained</li>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Amedee Island (Îlot Maître)</h4>
          <p>UNESCO marine reserve reached by 45-minute luxury yacht cruise. Climb 247 steps inside the 1865 Amedee Lighthouse for panoramic lagoon views. Glass-bottom boat tours over pristine coral gardens. White sand beaches. Snorkeling equipment included. Full-day tours (~€100-120) depart from terminal. The lighthouse climb is demanding but the summit view is transcendent. Book ahead — this is Noumea's signature experience.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Signal Island (Îlot Signal)</h4>
          <p>30-minute water taxi from downtown to small tropical island. Swim with green sea turtles in calm, clear water. White sand beaches, shaded picnic areas, historical walking trail. Water taxis depart regularly (~€20-25 round trip). Bring snorkel gear (or rent on island). Half-day minimum. The turtles are curious and abundant — this is one of the most reliable turtle encounters in the South Pacific.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tjibaou Cultural Centre</h4>
          <p>World-class museum dedicated to Kanak culture. Designed by Renzo Piano — striking contemporary architecture inspired by traditional Kanak structures. Permanent and rotating exhibits on indigenous art, music, history. Performance space. Lush botanical gardens. 20 minutes from port by taxi (~€25-30). Entry ~1,000 XPF ($10). Allow 2-3 hours. Essential for understanding New Caledonia beyond the French colonial narrative.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Aquarium des Lagons</h4>
          <p>Excellent aquarium showcasing New Caledonia's unique marine biodiversity. Tropical fish, sharks, rays, live coral displays. Fluorescent night reef exhibit. Located at Anse Vata Bay. 10 minutes from port by bus or taxi. Entry ~1,000 XPF ($10). 1-2 hours. Perfect rainy-day option or pre-beach stop. The diversity of lagoon species is remarkable — many found nowhere else.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Botanical Garden and Zoo (Parc Forestier)</h4>
          <p>Native flora and fauna in natural forest setting. Colorful parrots, flying foxes (fruit bats), and the cagou — New Caledonia's flightless national bird found nowhere else on Earth. Walking trails, elevated boardwalks. 20 minutes from port by taxi. Entry ~500 XPF ($5). Half-day for full exploration. The cagou is prehistoric-looking, endearingly odd, and critically endangered. Seeing one is a privilege.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Anse Vata Bay & Baie des Citrons</h4>
          <p>Noumea's two main beaches. Anse Vata offers lagoon views, calm swimming, proximity to Aquarium, and boat departures to Duck Island. Baie des Citrons ("BD") features golden sand, massive Banyan trees for shade, beachfront cafés, and local atmosphere. Both 10-15 minutes from port by Karui'a bus (affordable) or taxi. Public beaches — no entry fee. Full-day lounging or half-day combined with other activities.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Noumea is compact and walkable from terminal. Main shopping/dining within 10 minutes. Beaches require transport.</li>
            <li><strong>Tchou Tchou Train:</strong> Cute tourist train offering narrated city tours. Departs from downtown. ~2,000 XPF ($20) for circuit. Good overview orientation.</li>
            <li><strong>Karui'a Buses:</strong> Affordable public bus network serving beaches and suburbs. ~200 XPF ($2) single journey. Routes posted at stops. Less frequent than taxis but budget-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at terminal and downtown. Expensive (~€25-35 to attractions). Meters standard. Agree on fare for longer trips like Tjibaou Centre.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Taxis:</strong> Regular service to Signal Island and other îlots from Port Moselle/downtown. ~€20-25 round trip. Departures hourly. Best way to island-hop.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but unnecessary for cruise day unless exploring north island. Traffic drives on right. Roads good quality.</li>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>French Pastries:</strong> Authentic croissants, pain au chocolat, baguettes from boulangeriesindistinguishable from Paris. Morning ritual.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Parrotfish, tuna, prawns, lobster — prepared French-style with butter and herbs or Pacific-style with coconut and lime.</li>
            <li><strong>Bougna:</strong> Traditional Kanak dish — meat (chicken, fish, or pork) cooked with yams, taro, banana in coconut milk, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed in earth oven. Rich, smoky, culturally significant.</li>
            <li><strong>French-Pacific Fusion:</strong> Creative blend of French technique with Pacific ingredients — vanilla, tropical fruits, fresh fish, coconut. Many restaurants specialize.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine:</strong> Excellent French wine selection (imported from France). Prices reflect import costs but quality is high.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Serious French café culture. Espresso, café au lait, café crème — all prepared properly. Start your day right.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Noumea is expensive — expect Paris-level prices for meals, taxis, activities. Budget accordingly. Water and snacks from ship can save money.</li>
            <li>No tipping culture (French system) — service included in prices. Don't tip unless service was extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen essential — UV is intense, cloud cover deceives. Reef-safe sunscreen preferred for marine reserve visits.</li>
            <li>Book Amedee Island tours in advance — they fill quickly, especially when multiple ships are in port. Online or through ship excursions.</li>
            <li>Signal Island water taxis run frequently but check last departure time (usually 4-5pm). Missing it means expensive private boat back.</li>
            <li>Bring snorkel gear if you own it — rental available but having your own saves money for beach/island visits.</li>
            <li>Currency: ATMs downtown dispense XPF. Credit cards widely accepted. USD/EUR not commonly accepted — exchange first or use card.</li>
            <li>French language basics appreciated — "Bonjour," "merci," "s'il vous plaît" go a long way. English spoken at tourist sites but limited elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Climate is genuinely excellent — most sunshine days in South Pacific. Even "rainy" season sees brief showers, not all-day rain.</li>
          </ul>
