      <h3>Disco Circus Review: A Glittery Goodbye to the Voyage</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Disco Circus is Virgin Voyages' final-night blowout — a euphoric disco bash featuring wild acrobatics, party games, groovy costumes, and nonstop dancing. Created with the cast of Duel Reality, it typically takes place on the last night of the voyage and serves as the fleet's signature send-off event. The event is held in The Manor and sometimes spills onto the pool deck, depending on the ship and weather. No cover; drinks are Bar Tab or pay-per-drink. Expect sequins, glitter, and a crowd that has fully shed any remaining inhibitions.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>Drinks are served from The Manor bars and any satellite bars that open for the event. The champagne toast at midnight (or whenever the DJ hits the crescendo) is a highlight — sparkling wine passed on trays, free of charge. Beyond that, expect the standard bar menu. The vodka soda and gin and tonic are your best bets for quick service when the bars are slammed. Frozen cocktails are sometimes available on the pool deck if the party extends outdoors. Where it falls short: this is the busiest bar night of the entire voyage. Wait times are the longest you will experience. Bartenders are overwhelmed and cocktail quality drops accordingly. Pre-game at a quieter bar before heading in.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The entertainment crew goes all out — acrobats from Duel Reality perform throughout the crowd, DJs build the energy masterfully, and the host team leads group dances and party games. Confetti cannons, costume contests, and surprise moments keep the energy high. The entertainers are visibly having fun, which is infectious. Bar service struggles with the volume but the entertainment service is excellent.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Disco Circus is pure, unfiltered joy on a good night. The Manor is transformed with disco balls, colored lights, and a sound system pushed to its limits. The crowd dresses up in sequins, glitter, and outrageous outfits — the costume culture is a real highlight and unique to Virgin Voyages. The acrobatic interludes break up the dancing with genuine spectacle. Where it falls short: the event can feel overwhelming and overly chaotic for guests who prefer structure. The noise level is extreme. The crowd density near the dance floor can border on uncomfortable. And because it is the last night, some guests have overindulged throughout the day and the energy can tip from joyful to sloppy.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> Disco Circus is a memorable way to close a Virgin Voyages sailing — the energy, costumes, and acrobatics create something genuinely special. It falls short on bar service (overloaded), crowd management (too dense near the stage), and can feel chaotic rather than curated. If you enjoy big, loud, sweaty dance parties, this is the highlight of the voyage. <em>Tip:</em> plan your outfit in advance (sequins and glitter are sold in the ship shop) and arrive early to claim your spot — the dance floor fills completely by 11 PM.</p>
