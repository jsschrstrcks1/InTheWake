        <section class="port-section" id="logbook">
          <h2>My Logbook: Where Spiritual Grandeur Meets Modern Arabia</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've been researching Abu Dhabi for months now, yet nothing I've read quite prepares me for what travelers describe when they first encounter the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. The photographs are stunning, but by all accounts they fail to capture the scale — 82 white marble domes gleaming under the desert sun, gold-plated Swarovski chandeliers visible through arched windows, the world's largest hand-knotted carpet stretching across a prayer hall that holds 40,000 worshippers. I find myself planning my visit around the light, hoping to witness the marble turn gold at sunset.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/abu-dhabi/grand-mosque-interior.webp" alt="Ornate interior of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque with massive crystal chandeliers and intricate white marble columns" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Grand Mosque interior — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What draws me to Abu Dhabi is how different it feels from flashier Dubai. Though both cities rise from the same desert, Abu Dhabi carries itself with a quieter confidence — more measured, more cultural, less concerned with spectacle for spectacle's sake. Where Dubai seems to shout "look at me," Abu Dhabi whispers "stay awhile." I'm planning my visit during the winter months when temperatures hover around a comfortable 24°C, perfect for exploring without wilting in the summer heat that can exceed 45°C.</p>

            <p>My research has led me deep into the city's remarkable transformation. Just fifty years ago, Abu Dhabi was a small fishing and pearling village. Oil changed everything, but what strikes me is how the Emiratis have invested their wealth — not just in towers and shopping malls, but in world-class cultural institutions. The Louvre Abu Dhabi surprised me most. I'd expected perhaps a vanity project, a famous name bought with oil money. However, what I discovered through virtual tours and traveler accounts is a thoughtfully curated museum that tells human civilization through art, arranged chronologically rather than by culture.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/abu-dhabi/louvre-dome.webp" alt="Geometric latticed dome of Louvre Abu Dhabi creating patterns of light and shadow on the gallery floor" loading="lazy">
              <figcaption>Louvre Abu Dhabi dome — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I'm particularly excited about Jean Nouvel's dome at the Louvre — that extraordinary canopy of geometric stars filtering Arabian sunlight into what he calls a "rain of light." The outdoor promenade offers Gulf views, and I've marked it on my itinerary as a place to simply sit and absorb the architecture. Walking from ancient Egyptian artifacts to Renaissance masterpieces to contemporary works, all under that celestial dome, feels like traversing civilization itself.</p>

            <p>The dress code considerations have shaped my packing list significantly. Abu Dhabi is more conservative than Dubai, and I want to be respectful. For the Grand Mosque visit, I'm preparing modest clothing that covers arms and legs completely — though I understand free abayas are provided for women who need them. Even outside the mosque, I plan to keep shoulders and knees covered in public spaces. It's a small adjustment that shows respect for local culture.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>What I'm Most Looking Forward To:</strong> Sitting in the Grand Mosque courtyard at sunset, watching the white marble slowly turn gold, then pink, then purple as the call to prayer echoes across the complex. Non-Muslims aren't permitted during prayer times, but I've timed my planned visit to arrive just before sunset when the light is magic and the crowds have thinned. It costs nothing but patience and timing — and I have plenty of both.
            </div>

            <p>Zayed Port will be my gateway to this elegant capital. The cruise terminal sits on the main Abu Dhabi island, about 20 minutes from downtown and 30 minutes from the Grand Mosque by taxi. I've researched the silver taxis — the official ones with meters and air conditioning — and budgeted around $30-40 AED for the mosque journey. Some travelers recommend Uber or Careem apps as alternatives, though taxis are plentiful at the port.</p>

            <p>For my second Abu Dhabi priority, I'm torn between the Louvre and Yas Island's theme parks. Ferrari World tempts me with Formula Rossa, the world's fastest roller coaster reaching 240 km/h. Yet the Louvre speaks to something deeper — that desire to understand how humanity has expressed itself across millennia. I suspect I'll choose culture over coasters, but I'm leaving my itinerary flexible enough to change my mind.</p>

            <p>The Emirates Palace has also caught my attention, not as a guest (at those prices!) but as a visitor. The public areas are open to explore, and I've read about the gold-dispensing ATM that makes for a quirky photo opportunity. Afternoon tea there runs around $80 per person — extravagant, but perhaps worth the experience of sipping tea in a $3 billion hotel. I'm still deciding whether to splurge.</p>

            <p>My research into Abu Dhabi has convinced me that this is a port worth more than a quick visit. The combination of ancient Islamic architecture, cutting-edge museums, pristine beaches along the 8km Corniche, and that distinctly Arabian hospitality creates something unique in the cruise world. I'm going with an open heart and modest clothing, ready to discover what the UAE's capital reveals to those who take the time to look beyond the marble and gold. This promises to be unforgettable.</p>

        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Zayed Port (Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal) serves as the main cruise gateway to the UAE capital, located on the main Abu Dhabi island. The modern terminal building offers air-conditioned waiting areas, currency exchange, ATMs, tourist information, and a taxi rank immediately outside. Ships dock directly at the pier — no tender required.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">

          </figure>

          <p>The terminal is wheelchair accessible with ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms throughout. Distance to major attractions: downtown Abu Dhabi 20 minutes, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque 30 minutes, Louvre Abu Dhabi 20 minutes, Yas Island (Ferrari World) 40 minutes. Currency is UAE Dirham (AED), though US dollars are widely accepted and credit cards work everywhere. English is universally spoken alongside Arabic.</p>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION - 200+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Official Silver Taxis:</strong> The recommended option for cruise visitors. Metered, air-conditioned, and reliable. Available immediately outside the cruise terminal. Fare to Grand Mosque approximately 80-100 AED ($22-27), to Louvre Abu Dhabi around 70-90 AED ($19-25), to Yas Island 120-150 AED ($33-41). Pay by cash or card.</li>
            <li><strong>Uber/Careem:</strong> Both rideshare apps work in Abu Dhabi and offer competitive pricing. Careem (now owned by Uber) is particularly popular in the Gulf region. Useful for return journeys when taxis may be scarce at attractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ship Excursions:</strong> Cruise lines offer organized tours to major attractions with guaranteed return times. More expensive than independent travel but convenient for those preferring structured itineraries. Book through your cruise line's excursion desk.</li>
            <li><strong>Hop-On Hop-Off Bus:</strong> Big Bus Abu Dhabi operates routes connecting major attractions including the Grand Mosque, Corniche, and downtown. Day passes around 200 AED ($55). Good for independent exploration with flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Not practical for most sightseeing due to distances and heat. However, the Corniche promenade offers excellent walking along the 8km waterfront if you stay near the coast.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but generally unnecessary for cruise visitors. Traffic is orderly and well-signed if you do choose to drive. International driving permits are strongly recommended for visitors.</li>

          <h2>Beaches &amp; Waterfront</h2>
          <p>Abu Dhabi offers pristine beaches along its island coastline, though beach culture here is more conservative than Western destinations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Corniche Beach:</strong> 8km of public beach and promenade along the main island's waterfront. Clean, well-maintained, with designated swimming areas and lifeguards. Free access with paid sunbed rentals available. Family-friendly with changing facilities. Best for morning visits before heat builds.</li>
            <li><strong>Saadiyat Public Beach:</strong> Near the Louvre on Saadiyat Island. Pristine white sand with turquoise water. Entry fee around 25 AED ($7) with beach chair included. Less crowded than Corniche, more resort-like atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Yas Beach:</strong> On Yas Island near Ferrari World. Day passes available for non-hotel guests (around 100 AED/$27 weekdays). Good option if combining with theme park visit.</li>
            <li><strong>Soul Beach (Saadiyat):</strong> Trendy beach club with restaurant. Day passes around 150 AED ($41). More upscale atmosphere with DJ and pool access.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: Conservative swimwear is appropriate. Bikinis are acceptable at beaches but cover up when leaving beach areas.</p>

            <li><strong>Li Beirut at Jumeirah ($$$):</strong> Excellent Lebanese cuisine with waterfront views. Mezze platters, fresh grilled meats, and sophisticated atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Le Café at Emirates Palace ($$-$$$):</strong> Gold-dusted cappuccino and elegant pastries in palatial surroundings. Worth visiting even just for coffee and photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Café Arabia ($):</strong> Casual spot for Arabic coffee, fresh juices, and light bites. Good for a quick refreshment near downtown.</li>
            <li><strong>The Cheesecake Factory ($$):</strong> American chain at Yas Mall, familiar option if you want something predictable after cultural exploration.</li>

            <li><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Abu Dhabi is more conservative than Dubai. Cover shoulders and knees in public spaces. Grand Mosque requires full modest dress for all visitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Ramadan:</strong> During the holy month, eating, drinking, and smoking in public during daylight hours is prohibited. Many restaurants close until sunset. Cruise visitors should be discreet about consuming food/drink in public areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Friday Timing:</strong> The Grand Mosque closes to non-Muslim visitors during Friday prayers (approximately 12-3pm). Plan mosque visits accordingly.</li>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE, a wealthy and well-organized city where infrastructure works smoothly. The atmosphere is more relaxed and cultural than neighboring Dubai. Currency is the UAE Dirham (AED), pegged to the US dollar at approximately 3.67 AED = $1. US dollars are widely accepted, and credit cards work everywhere. ATMs are plentiful. English is universally spoken alongside Arabic.</p>

          <p>Safety is excellent — Abu Dhabi consistently ranks among the world's safest cities. Standard urban awareness applies, but violent crime is virtually unknown. The main considerations are cultural: dress modestly, respect local customs, and be aware that public displays of affection are frowned upon. Alcohol is only available in licensed venues (hotels), and public intoxication is illegal.</p>

          <p>The cruise terminal and major attractions offer wheelchair accessibility with ramps, elevators, and accessible facilities. The Grand Mosque provides wheelchairs on request. Taxis can accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice. Summer heat can be challenging for those with mobility issues — plan air-conditioned attractions during hot months.</p>

          <p>Cell service is excellent with local SIM cards available. Free WiFi is common at hotels, malls, and attractions. Uber and Careem apps work throughout the city. Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory — 10% at restaurants is customary.</p>

        <section class="port-section" id="faq">
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Abu Dhabi?</strong><br>A: Ships dock at Zayed Port (Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal) on the main island. The modern terminal is about 20 minutes from downtown Abu Dhabi, 30 minutes from the Grand Mosque, and 20 minutes from the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Taxis are immediately available outside.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What should I wear to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque?</strong><br>A: Modest dress is mandatory. Women must cover hair, arms, and legs completely. Men need long trousers and shirts with sleeves. Free abayas (for women) and kanduras (for men) are provided at the entrance if your clothing doesn't meet requirements. This is strictly enforced.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Is Abu Dhabi expensive?</strong><br>A: Similar to major Western cities. Taxis are reasonable (metered). The Grand Mosque and Corniche are free. Museums run $15-25, theme parks $70-100. Restaurant meals range from $10-15 at casual spots to $50+ at hotel restaurants. Budget around $50-100 per person for a day of independent sightseeing including transport and lunch.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Abu Dhabi or Dubai — which is better?</strong><br>A: Different experiences. Abu Dhabi is more cultural and relaxed — the Grand Mosque and Louvre are world-class. Dubai is flashier and more commercial with bigger malls and more nightlife. Many cruises visit both, which is ideal for comparison.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Can I drink alcohol in Abu Dhabi?</strong><br>A: Only in licensed venues (hotels and some restaurants). No public drinking. Public intoxication is illegal. Most cruise visitors find hotel bars or skip alcohol during their port day.</p>
