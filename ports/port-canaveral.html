          <h2>My Logbook: Where Rockets and Ships Share the Sky</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've passed through Port Canaveral more times than I can count, and each visit carries that same electric wonder. This is one of the world's busiest cruise ports — over five million passengers annually — serving as Florida's gateway for Disney, Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and MSC cruises. But what sets this place apart isn't just the ships. It's the rockets. This is where America's space program meets the sea, and that combination creates magic unlike anywhere else on Earth.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/port-canaveral/kennedy-space-center.webp" alt="Space Shuttle Atlantis on display at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex with dramatic lighting against dark background" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Kennedy Space Center — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Located on Florida's Space Coast, about an hour east of Orlando, Port Canaveral sits a mere fifteen miles from Kennedy Space Center — close enough that you can see the Vehicle Assembly Building rising from the marshlands, close enough that a rocket launch shakes your chest and lights the night sky brighter than the full moon. I've watched launches from Jetty Park, from ship decks, from beachside hotel balconies, and every single time, I'm moved to tears. There's something profound about witnessing humanity reach for the stars while standing at the edge of the sea.</p>

            <p>The port's history is inseparable from America's space program — a partnership written in fire and salt water. The first rocket launched from Cape Canaveral on July 24, 1950, when a modified V-2 called Bumper 8 lifted skyward, three years before the port even opened in 1953. When NASA was established in 1958, and Kennedy Space Center formally named in 1963 after the fallen president, this stretch of Florida coastline became the threshold of human spaceflight. The Cape was chosen deliberately — Earth's rotation gives rockets launched eastward a velocity advantage, and launching over water toward the equator meant less risk to populated areas. Geography as destiny.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/port-canaveral/cruise-terminal.webp" alt="Modern Port Canaveral cruise terminal building with Royal Caribbean ship docked and palm trees framing the entrance" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Port Canaveral terminal — <a href="https://www.flickersofmajesty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickers of Majesty</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I've always been fascinated by how the port itself became part of the space story. In 1965, NASA contributed $250,000 for improvements to the port's locks — not charity, but necessity. Massive segments of the Saturn V rocket that would carry Apollo astronauts to the moon transited through these waters. Later, the enormous external fuel tanks for the Space Shuttle — too large to transport by road — were floated by barge from their Louisiana birthplace through Port Canaveral's channels to the Cape. The port wasn't just watching history; it was carrying it.</p>

            <p>From this shoreline, I've learned the names that echo through the decades: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo. Alan Shepard's first American spaceflight in 1961. John Glenn circling Earth in 1962. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin departing for the moon in 1969. Every Space Shuttle mission from 1981 to 2011. And now, in our time, SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets lift off with such frequency that locals barely pause — though I still do, every time.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Watching a SpaceX Falcon 9 light up the sky from Jetty Park the night before we sailed. The rumble built slowly, then hit my chest like a physical thing. The trail of fire ascending, the second stage separation, the sonic boom echoing across the water as the booster returned to land. Humans heading to space while I stood at the edge of the sea — it's a communion with the extraordinary that still gives me chills.
            </div>

            <p>My pre-cruise ritual always includes Kennedy Space Center. Standing beneath the Saturn V — the actual rocket that could have carried astronauts to the moon — I'm overwhelmed by its scale. Touching a moon rock that's older than life on Earth. Seeing Space Shuttle Atlantis suspended as if still in orbit, the thermal tiles scorched from reentry. You understand why this place feels different from every other cruise port. The Canaveral area takes its name from the Spanish "Cañaveral" (cane field), dating to early explorers in the 1500s who found this coast covered in wild sugarcane. But today it's known for reaching beyond our world.</p>

            <p>The port handles seven terminals, each processing that constant flow of ships heading to the Bahamas, Caribbean, and beyond. Disney has their own themed terminal (Terminal 8), Royal Caribbean operates from Terminal 1, and others rotate through the remaining berths. But take time — even a half-day — for Kennedy Space Center before you sail. Walk the same ground where Apollo astronauts prepared for missions. Meet actual astronauts during daily presentations. Touch the history. You'll understand why I keep coming back.</p>

            <p>What makes Port Canaveral special is that juxtaposition of dreams. Cruise ships heading for tropical beaches pass within sight of launch pads reaching for the moon. Families loading onto their vacation vessels can watch rockets climb into the sky. It's uniquely American, uniquely Floridian, and it never fails to remind me that we're capable of both relaxation and reaching for the stars. That combination is why Port Canaveral remains my favorite departure port, despite having sailed from Miami, Tampa, and New Orleans over the years.</p>

        <!-- CRUISE PORT SECTION - 100+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Port Canaveral operates seven cruise terminals handling over five million passengers annually — the second-busiest cruise port in the world. Disney uses Terminal 8 (with themed interiors featuring cast member greetings), Royal Caribbean uses Terminal 1, and Carnival, Norwegian, and MSC rotate through other terminals. Check your cruise documents for exact terminal assignment.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">

          </figure>

          <p>All terminals are wheelchair accessible with modern facilities, air conditioning, and efficient processing. Embarkation typically runs 11am-3pm depending on cruise line. Security screening is similar to airport procedures — have documents ready (passport, boarding pass, health forms if required). Drop luggage with porters before parking for easier processing. Currency is US dollars throughout the port and surrounding area.</p>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION - 200+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>From Orlando Airport (MCO):</strong> 45-60 minutes via SR-528 (Beachline Expressway). Uber/Lyft runs $50-70. Taxis are metered at similar rates. Multiple shuttle companies offer MCO-to-port transfers at lower cost but less flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>From Orlando Theme Parks:</strong> 60-75 minutes depending on traffic and which park. Allow extra time during peak periods — I-4 traffic can be brutal around Disney and Universal.</li>
            <li><strong>From Melbourne Airport (MLB):</strong> 30 minutes, a quieter alternative for those wanting to avoid Orlando entirely. Smaller airport with fewer flight options but much easier logistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Port Parking ($17-20/day):</strong> On-site parking available at each terminal. Reserve ahead for peak sailing dates at the port website — parking can fill up during busy periods. Credit cards accepted.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Site Parking ($12-15/day):</strong> Several third-party lots nearby with shuttle service to terminals. Check reviews and verify shuttle frequency before booking. Savings are modest but add up for longer cruises.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotel Park & Cruise:</strong> Many area hotels offer packages with parking included. Radisson Resort at the Port is popular with shuttle service. Country Inn & Suites offers free parking for up to 8 days with cruise packages.</li>
            <li><strong>Getting to Kennedy Space Center:</strong> 20 minutes from the port. Uber/Lyft works but can be pricey for return. Consider rental car if planning extended Space Coast exploration.</li>

          <h2>Pre-Cruise Activities &amp; Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Kennedy Space Center requires advance booking during peak season for guaranteed entry. SpaceX launches are free to watch from public areas. Orlando theme parks need advance reservations. Book ahead through official websites for best availability.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</h4>
          <p>The iconic space exploration experience — stand beneath a Saturn V rocket, see Space Shuttle Atlantis suspended as if in orbit, touch a moon rock. Meet real astronauts during daily presentations. Plan a full day to experience everything, or at least half a day for highlights. Entry around $75 adults. Book ahead through kennedyspacecenter.com for guaranteed entry and to skip lines during peak season.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">SpaceX Rocket Launch Viewing</h4>
          <p>Check spacex.com/launches before your trip — SpaceX launches frequently from Cape Canaveral. Jetty Park and Playalinda Beach offer free public viewing of launches. Evening launches are especially spectacular. No advance booking needed; just check the schedule and show up early for good spots. If a launch happens during your port stay, crowd the ship's decks for an unforgettable view.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge</h4>
          <p>140,000 acres of diverse habitats surrounding Kennedy Space Center. Black Point Wildlife Drive offers excellent birding — manatees, alligators, and hundreds of bird species. Free entry. The juxtaposition of wildlife preserve and rocket launch pads is uniquely Floridian. Allow 2-3 hours for the drive and short walks.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Orlando Theme Parks (60-75 min drive)</h4>
          <p>Disney World, Universal Studios, SeaWorld all accessible for a pre-cruise day. All require advance reservations and park tickets. Consider whether the drive and crowds are worth it versus Space Coast activities. Many cruisers combine a theme park visit with their cruise vacation. Book through official park websites for guaranteed return time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Manatee Viewing (November-March)</h4>
          <p>Winter months bring hundreds of manatees to warm springs throughout Florida. Blue Spring State Park (1 hour west) offers excellent viewing from boardwalks. Free with park entry ($6 per vehicle). Best viewing early morning when manatees congregate in the warm water. An unforgettable wildlife experience during cool weather months.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ron Jon Surf Shop &amp; Cocoa Beach</h4>
          <p>The famous surf shop at 4151 N Atlantic Ave is open 24/7 — perfect for last-minute beach supplies or late-night souvenir shopping. Two floors of surf gear, Florida souvenirs, and beach essentials. Cocoa Beach itself offers good restaurants, surf lessons, and that classic Florida beach vibe. The historic pier is great for fishing and casual people-watching. No advance booking needed for any Cocoa Beach activities.</p>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>Port Canaveral sits on Florida's Space Coast, about an hour east of Orlando. The area is relaxed and safe — typical Florida beach town atmosphere. Currency is US dollars, and credit cards are accepted everywhere. The weather is classic Florida: hot and humid in summer with afternoon storms, mild and pleasant in winter. Bring sunscreen year-round and a light rain jacket May through September.</p>

          <p>The port area is wheelchair accessible throughout, with modern terminal facilities and smooth pathways. Kennedy Space Center offers excellent accessibility with wheelchairs available for rent. Beaches vary in accessibility — Jetty Park has boardwalk access to viewing areas. Cocoa Beach has some beach wheelchair access points at main lifeguard stations.</p>

          <p>Cell service is excellent throughout the Space Coast. Free WiFi available at most hotels and restaurants. Uber and Lyft operate in the area but availability can be spotty late at night — consider rental car for flexibility. Tipping follows standard US norms. The atmosphere is casual; even nicer restaurants welcome beach attire.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Kennedy Space Center worth visiting before a cruise?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely — it's one of the best attractions in Florida and unlike anything else. Stand beneath a Saturn V rocket, see Space Shuttle Atlantis, touch a moon rock, meet real astronauts. Plan a full day, or at least half a day for highlights. Book in advance for guaranteed entry during peak season.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: How far is Port Canaveral from Orlando airport?</strong><br/>A: 45-60 minutes via SR-528 (Beachline Expressway). Uber/Lyft runs $50-70. Multiple shuttle companies offer transfers at lower cost. Allow extra time during theme park peaks and holidays when traffic can back up.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Can I watch a rocket launch during my cruise?</strong><br/>A: Check the SpaceX launch schedule at spacex.com/launches before your trip. SpaceX launches frequently from Cape Canaveral. Jetty Park and Playalinda Beach offer free public viewing. If a launch coincides with your port stay, watch from the ship's deck — it's unforgettable.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Where should I park at Port Canaveral?</strong><br/>A: On-site parking at each terminal costs $17-20/day. Reserve ahead for peak sailing dates at the port website. Off-site lots nearby offer cheaper rates ($12-15/day) with shuttle service. Many hotels offer Park & Cruise packages that include parking for your cruise duration.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Which terminal is my ship at?</strong><br/>A: Check your cruise documents — terminals vary by cruise line. Disney uses Terminal 8 (themed with cast members), Royal Caribbean uses Terminal 1, and others rotate through remaining terminals.</p>
