          <h2>My Logbook: Napoleon's Birthplace</h2>
          <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
            <p>I've been researching Ajaccio with growing fascination, yet nothing in my planning quite captures the romance of approaching Corsica's capital by tender. My research has revealed ships anchor in the sapphire bay, passengers riding small boats toward the 16th-century Genoese citadel rising golden above the harbor. The moment I step ashore, I want to understand why Napoleon carried this island in his heart — the air reportedly smells of maquis and espresso, that honey-sweet scrub carpeting the mountains in wild thyme, rosemary, and juniper.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
              <img src="/ports/img/ajaccio/ajaccio-1.webp" alt="Ajaccio harbor view with fishing boats and colorful waterfront buildings reflecting in calm Mediterranean waters" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Ajaccio harbor — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What draws me to Ajaccio is walking straight into Napoleon's world. The future emperor was born here on August 15, 1769 — remarkably just one year after Corsica passed from Genoa to France. I've read that you cannot take three steps in Ajaccio without stumbling into his legend. At Place Foch, his bronze statue stands dressed as a Roman consul, flanked by his four brothers, gazing out over the harbor. Though tourists might dismiss this as tourist kitsch, I sense something deeper — a city genuinely shaped by one remarkable life.</p>

            <p>The real treasure in my planning is Maison Bonaparte. My research has revealed the Bonaparte family lived in this house since 1682, and walking through those rooms — small, warm, surprisingly intimate — promises to make the future emperor feel tangible. In the 1960s the family gave the house to the French government, and now it stands as a national museum. I'm eager to stand in the upstairs room where Napoleon's mother Letizia gave birth to him on that August day in 1769, imagining that summer afternoon with windows open to the Mediterranean breeze.</p>

            <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
              <img src="/ports/img/ajaccio/ajaccio-2.webp" alt="Ajaccio waterfront promenade with palm trees and historic buildings overlooking the marina" loading="lazy"/>
              <figcaption>Ajaccio waterfront — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>My afternoon is already mentally planned for the Palais Fesch Museum. Cardinal Fesch was Napoleon's uncle, and his collection of Italian paintings is reportedly second only to the Louvre. Room after room of Botticelli, Titian, Veronese — the kind of art that stops time. However, what intrigues me most is how such world-class treasures ended up on this small Mediterranean island. Afterward I plan to duck into Notre Dame Cathedral, a Baroque beauty where Napoleon himself was baptized, its interior glowing with marble and gilt.</p>

            <p>The morning market has captured my imagination as much as any museum. I've been reading about brocciu cheese — fresh, creamy, utterly unlike anything found on the mainland — along with slices of coppa and prisuttu, the island's exquisite dry-cured ham fragrant with mountain herbs. Vendors reportedly hand out samples with a smile and a shrug, as if to say "This is just how we eat here." I'm already planning to sit on a bench in the old town, eating charcuterie with crusty bread, watching old men play pétanque under plane trees.</p>

            <div class="poignant-highlight">
              <strong>What I'm Most Looking Forward To:</strong> Riding the tender across that sapphire bay, watching the citadel grow larger as we approach. Then floating in warm Mediterranean waters at Plage Saint-François while the scent of maquis drifts down from the mountains. I keep reading about visitors moved to tears by Corsica's beauty — wild, proud, utterly its own. I want to understand why Napoleon never forgot this place.
            </div>

            <p>The beaches have added an unexpected dimension to my planning. Plage Saint-François sits just ten minutes walk from the port — an easy option for a quick swim between cultural sights. Yet the remote beaches call to me more strongly. Plage de Capo di Feno promises wild windswept beauty and that impossible Corsican blue-green water. I've budgeted a half-day for driving up the coast, perhaps stopping at a paillote beach shack for grilled fish and chilled rosé with waves crashing nearby.</p>

            <p>My research into Place d'Austerlitz has been compelling. Known locally as Place du Casone, a 1938 monument shows Napoleon crowned by eagles, surveying his birthplace from a hillside of Mediterranean pines. I imagine standing there at sunset, looking down at the city as its lights begin to glow, understanding why this island shaped the man who would reshape Europe. The past feels very close in Ajaccio.</p>

            <p>What strikes me most about Ajaccio is how it offers Corsican authenticity wrapped in French sophistication. This isn't a manufactured tourist destination but a living city proud of its unique heritage — Genoese walls, French governance, and a fierce island identity that produced one of history's most consequential figures. I'm going with respect for that layered past, appreciation for world-class art and cuisine, and excitement for Mediterranean beaches that promise the kind of beauty that doesn't look real in photographs.</p>

            <p>The Corsican identity itself fascinates me. French by governance since 1768, Italian by cultural proximity, yet fiercely Corsican above all else. I've read that Napoleon spoke French with a Corsican accent his entire life, never quite shedding the island from his tongue. That detail captures something essential about this place — an island that shapes you permanently, that leaves its mark on emperors and ordinary travelers alike. I want to feel that Corsican spirit for myself.</p>

        <!-- CRUISE PORT SECTION - 100+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="cruise-port">
          <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
          <p>Ajaccio is primarily a tender port — most cruise ships anchor in the magnificent bay and ferry passengers ashore on tender boats. The tender ride itself takes 10-15 minutes and offers wonderful views of the Genoese citadel and maquis-covered mountains as you approach. Tenders land at the port area near the old town.</p>

          <figure class="logbook-image">
            <img src="/ports/img/ajaccio/ajaccio-4.webp" alt="Cruise tender approaching Ajaccio port with the historic citadel and mountains visible in the background" loading="lazy"/>
            <figcaption>Tender approach — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a></figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Once ashore, the old town is immediately walkable — Maison Bonaparte, the cathedral, Place Foch, and the morning market are all within easy strolling distance. Currency is the Euro. French is the official language though you'll hear Corsican spoken among locals. A few French phrases go a long way and islanders appreciate the effort. The tender area has wheelchair ramps; downtown has variable accessibility with cobblestone streets in the old quarter.</p>

        <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION - 200+ words -->
        <section class="port-section" id="getting-around">
          <h2>Getting Around</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tender Information:</strong> Ships anchor in the bay and shuttle passengers ashore (10-15 minute ride). Tender wait times vary — early morning or late afternoon typically less crowded. The ride offers excellent photo opportunities of the citadel.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Most practical option for the old town. Maison Bonaparte, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place Foch, Palais Fesch, and the morning market are all within comfortable walking distance. Plage Saint-François is 10 minutes walk from the port.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available near the tender landing. Expect €10-15 to nearby beaches like Trottel, €25-35 to Capo di Feno. Negotiate fare before departure or insist on the meter. French-speaking drivers may have limited English.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Worthwhile for wild beaches like Capo di Feno or the Route des Sanguinaires coastal road (€40-60/day). Corsican roads are narrow and winding — drive slowly and use turnouts for faster local traffic. The scenery is spectacular and worth the careful navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Ship excursions and local operators offer beach trips, Napoleon-themed walking tours, and countryside drives. Local tours typically €35-55 per person — often better value than ship excursions. Book through ship or local operators at the port.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Limited but available for reaching some beaches. Routes can be confusing for visitors with limited time ashore.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Beaches &amp; Shorelines</h2>
          <p>Ajaccio's Mediterranean beaches offer crystal-clear water and dramatic coastal scenery:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Plage Saint-François:</strong> Closest to the tender landing — just 10 minutes walk. Small sandy beach popular with locals. Calm waters, easy access, no advance booking needed. Beach chair rentals around €10-15. Perfect for a quick swim between cultural sights.</li>
            <li><strong>Trottel Beach:</strong> Popular local beach south of the center. Larger than Saint-François with better facilities. 15 minutes by taxi (€10-15). Good for families with calmer waters and nearby cafes.</li>
            <li><strong>Route des Sanguinaires:</strong> Stunning coastal road with rocky coves and small beaches. Dramatic red granite formations at sunset. Requires taxi or rental car. Multiple stopping points for swimming and photography.</li>
            <li><strong>Plage de Capo di Feno:</strong> Wild, windswept beach 25 minutes by car. That impossible Corsican blue-green water against untouched coastline. Popular with surfers and adventurous visitors. Paillote beach shacks serve fresh grilled fish and rosé (€20-30 for lunch).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tip: Mediterranean water is warm June through September. Beaches are free though chair rentals cost €10-15. The water is remarkably clear for swimming and snorkeling.</p>

        <section class="port-section" id="excursions">
          <h2>Shore Excursions &amp; Things to Do</h2>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Booking guidance: Maison Bonaparte and Palais Fesch are walk-up visits (€7-8 admission). Beach trips require no booking. Ship excursion options through the cruise line offer guaranteed return to ship. Independent exploration works well in walkable Ajaccio — local walking tours can be booked through operators at the port (€35-55 per person).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Maison Bonaparte</h4>
          <p>Napoleon's childhood home, now a national museum preserving the house where the future emperor was born on August 15, 1769.

Deeply moving for anyone interested in the man who reshaped Europe. Admission €7, no advance booking required. Open daily except Mondays. Allow 1-1.5 hours. 10-minute walk from tender landing. One of Corsica's most significant sites.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Palais Fesch Museum</h4>
          <p>Extraordinary collection of Italian Renaissance paintings — second only to the Louvre in France. Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Napoleon's uncle, assembled masterworks by Botticelli, Titian, Veronese, and Bellini. The building itself is magnificent. A revelation for art lovers who don't expect world-class treasures on a small Mediterranean island. Admission €8, no advance booking needed. Closed Mondays. Allow 2-3 hours to properly appreciate the collection. 15-minute walk from the port through the charming old town.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Old Town Walking Tour</h4>
          <p>Explore the Genoese old town with its narrow streets, colorful buildings, and Napoleon landmarks. Visit Place Foch with its bronze Napoleon statue dressed as Roman consul, Place d'Austerlitz monument with eagles crowning the emperor, Notre Dame Cathedral where Napoleon was baptized (free entry), and the bustling morning market. Self-guided walks are easy — get a map from tourist information near the tender landing. Book guided tours through the ship excursion desk (€45-65) or reserve with local operators (€35-55) for added depth. Allow 2-3 hours for a thorough exploration.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Morning Market</h4>
          <p>Sensory overload of Corsican flavors at the covered market near Place Foch. Sample brocciu cheese (fresh and creamy), coppa and prisuttu (Corsican charcuterie at €5-15 per portion), chestnut honey, and fragrant herbs. Vendors offer generous samples with island hospitality. Buy provisions for a picnic on the beach or gifts to take home. Open mornings daily except Monday. No booking required. Free to browse. Allow 30-60 minutes to sample everything.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Beach Day at Capo di Feno</h4>
          <p>Escape to Corsica's wild side at this remote beach 25 minutes by rental car. Windswept beauty, that impossible blue-green Mediterranean water, and unspoiled coastline. Popular with surfers and nature lovers. Paillote beach shacks serve fresh grilled fish, seafood, and chilled rosé (€20-30 for lunch). Rental car recommended (€40-60/day) — Corsican roads are narrow but the coastal scenery is spectacular. Allow half-day. Book your rental car in advance during summer peak season.</p>

        <!-- FOOD SECTION -->
        <section class="port-section" id="food">
          <h2>Food &amp; Dining</h2>
          <p>Corsican cuisine blends French sophistication with Italian influences and fierce island character:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Corsican Charcuterie ($$):</strong> Lonzu (dried pork loin), coppa (cured pork shoulder), figatellu (liver sausage), and prisuttu (Corsican ham aged with mountain herbs). Sample at the morning market or order as antipasti at restaurants. €12-18 for a sharing platter.</li>
            <li><strong>Brocciu Cheese ($):</strong> Fresh, creamy sheep or goat cheese utterly unlike mainland varieties. Used in everything from omelettes to pastries. Try it with chestnut honey. €4-8 at the market.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>Budget tip: The morning market offers incredible value for sampling Corsican specialties. Grab provisions for a beach picnic instead of a restaurant lunch.</p>
          <p>Note: Corsican wine is excellent and affordable — try the local rosé (€4-6/glass). Most restaurants have English menus in tourist areas.</p>

          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
          <p>Ajaccio is the capital of Corsica, a French island in the Mediterranean between France and Italy. The city offers a unique blend of French governance, Italian influences, and fierce Corsican identity. Napoleon's birthplace is preserved as a national museum, and his legacy shapes the city's character. Currency is the Euro — approximately €1 = $1.10 USD. Credit cards widely accepted at restaurants and museums.</p>

          <p>Safety is excellent — Ajaccio is a welcoming city with low crime. Standard travel precautions apply. Vendors are friendly rather than aggressive. The old town is safe for evening strolls.</p>

          <p>The tender landing area is wheelchair accessible with ramps. However, the old town has cobblestone streets and uneven surfaces that challenge mobility-impaired visitors. Palais Fesch has elevator access. Maison Bonaparte has limited accessibility in the older sections. Beaches vary — Plage Saint-François is relatively accessible while remote beaches like Capo di Feno are more challenging.</p>

          <p>Languages are French and Corsican. English is spoken at major tourist sites and restaurants but not universally. Basic French phrases help: "Bonjour" (hello), "Merci" (thank you), "L'addition, s'il vous plaît" (check please). A few words of effort earn warm island hospitality.</p>
