I'd arrive at the ship already needing the ship.\n\n[Norwegian Gem](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-gem.html) sails from Manhattan. I took a taxi.\n\nNo TSA lines. No early morning flights. No luggage limitations. I left my apartment after lunch and boarded by three. The vacation started when I walked out my door, not when I collapsed into my cabin after airports.\n\nThe Manhattan skyline provided what no other departure could. Sailing past the Statue of Liberty, watching the city I know fade into the Atlantic. My city becoming my send-off.\n\n'You live here?' a passenger asked, watching me photograph familiar buildings.\n\n'I live there,' I pointed. 'That's why this departure matters.'\n\nFor East Coast residents, Manhattan departure eliminates the travel-to-travel problem completely.\n\n**The truth:** Gem's Manhattan departure makes cruising effortless for the region. No flights, no hotels, no pre-cruise exhaustion.\n\nI cruise Gem exclusively for the departure now. The Bahamas are fine. The departure is essential.",

But friends who'd cruised to Bermuda insisted: the sand is actually pink.\n\n[Norwegian Gem](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-gem.html) from New York proved them right.\n\nHorseshoe Bay's sand was genuinely pink\u2014not dramatically, but authentically. The coral fragments that create the color sparkled in sunlight. I'd been prepared for disappointment; I received wonder.\n\nGem's overnight stay allowed proper beach time. Not the rushed four-hour port calls of Caribbean cruising, but actual beach days. We returned at sunset. We returned at sunrise. The pink sand revealed itself differently at every hour.\n\n'I didn't believe it would actually be pink,' my wife admitted.\n\n'I didn't believe it until I touched it,' I agreed.\n\n**The lesson:** Gem's Bermuda itinerary delivers on the pink sand promise.",

Too far from home. Too much everything.\n\n[Norwegian Gem's](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-gem.html) four-day Bermuda cruise was exactly right.\n\nShort enough to survive if I hated it. Close enough to home that escape felt possible. Just enough time to test solo travel without committing to extended loneliness.\n\nI cried the first night\u2014watching couples at dinner, sleeping alone in a ship cabin, feeling the absence everywhere. But by day two, I'd found rhythm. By day three, I'd found fellow solo travelers. By day four, I'd proven something to myself.\n\n'First trip alone?' the bartender asked, recognizing my nervous energy.\n\n'First anything alone,' I admitted.\n\n'You're doing fine,' he assured me. 'The ship holds you.'\n\nHe was right. Gem held me.\n\n**The truth:** Gem's short cruises work for grief testing. Brief enough to be brave. Close enough to feel safe.\n\nI've cruised Gem solo three times now. Each voyage gets easier. That first four-day test made everything after possible.\n\n**The lesson:** Grief needs beautiful places to breathe.",

Specialty dining that's excellent. Entertainment that's engaging. Size that's manageable.\n\nThe convenience multiplied the value. No flight costs. No hotel costs. No exhaustion costs. The same cruise fare delivered more vacation because logistics consumed nothing.\n\n'But it's not the newest ship,' a friend argued.\n\n'But it's from my city,' I countered.

'That's what mattered.'\n\n**The truth:** Gem's Manhattan departure makes Bermuda accessible to wheelchair users. No flights means no chair damage. Drive-on cruising is real accessibility.\n\nI cruise Gem to Bermuda specifically because my chair survives. The pink sand is bonus. The functioning wheelchair is essential.\n\n**The lesson:** Accessibility means equal dignity, not special treatment.",
