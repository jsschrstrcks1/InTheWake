    <article class="card"><h1>Sharm el-Sheikh: Where the Desert Meets the Deep Blue</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The tender ride from our ship into Sharm el-Sheikh gave me time to appreciate what makes this place extraordinary. Behind us, the jagged peaks of the Sinai Mountains rose like ancient sentinels, their rust-colored faces catching the morning light. Ahead, the marina glittered against impossibly blue water — that particular shade of turquoise that exists nowhere else but the Red Sea. I could see the barren desert landscape meeting pristine coastline, and I understood immediately why this remote peninsula has become one of the diving world's most treasured destinations.</p>

        <p>Sharm el-Sheikh is unabashedly a resort town, built with purpose from desert sands. There's no pretense of being anything other than what it is: a gateway to some of the planet's most spectacular underwater scenery. What surprises first-time visitors is how well it works — how genuinely welcoming the Egyptian hospitality is, how efficiently the tourism infrastructure operates, and how quickly you forget the artificial origins when you're floating above gardens of coral that have been growing for millennia.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Snorkeling at Ras Mohammed National Park, drifting over the reef wall where the shallow coral garden suddenly dropped into an abyss of deep blue. Below me, the reef descended into mystery; around me, clouds of anthias flickered like living confetti. A sea turtle glided past, utterly unbothered by my presence. In that moment, suspended between desert and depths, I felt perfectly, peacefully small — a temporary visitor to an ancient, thriving world that will outlast all our human constructions.
        </div>

        <p>The warmth of the Red Sea surprised me even in winter. At 22-28°C year-round, the water welcomes rather than shocks. Visibility regularly exceeds 30 meters — on clear days, you can see the entire reef ecosystem spreading beneath you like a living tapestry. Even if you've never snorkeled before, Sharm el-Sheikh offers an accessible introduction. The house reefs at many beaches slope gently, giving tentative swimmers time to build confidence before venturing further.</p>

        <p>Beyond the water, the desert holds its own magic. The drive to St. Catherine's Monastery winds through landscapes so barren and beautiful they feel biblical — which makes sense, given that Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments on nearby Mount Sinai. The monastery itself, built in the 6th century and still home to Greek Orthodox monks, radiates a quiet holiness that transcends tourism. Standing in the desert dawn, watching light creep across mountains that have witnessed human history since its earliest chapters, reminded me why people have always sought the sacred in wilderness.</p>

        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What I'd do with limited time in Egypt's Red Sea paradise.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ras Mohammed National Park</h4>
        <p>Egypt's first national park protects some of the Red Sea's finest coral reefs. The underwater cliffs, pristine corals, and incredible marine biodiversity make this essential for divers and snorkelers. Shore excursions typically include snorkeling stops, desert viewpoints, and the mangrove forest. The "Magic Lake" — a landlocked saltwater lagoon — offers an otherworldly swimming experience. Budget: $50-80 for half-day tours.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tiran Island Diving and Snorkeling</h4>
        <p>The straits between Sinai and Tiran Island feature four famous dive sites named after 19th-century cartographers: Jackson, Woodhouse, Thomas, and Gordon reefs. Even snorkelers can appreciate the shallow coral gardens and tropical fish. The area is also known for wrecks, including remnants of vessels that misjudged the narrow passage. Tour boats from Sharm include multiple snorkel stops. Budget: $45-70 for full-day boat trips.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">St. Catherine's Monastery & Mount Sinai</h4>
        <p>This full-day excursion ventures deep into the Sinai interior to one of the world's oldest continuously operating Christian monasteries (founded 6th century AD). The monastery houses priceless icons and ancient manuscripts; the adjacent burning bush is said to be descended from the biblical original. Many tours include the pre-dawn climb of Mount Sinai (2,285m) to watch sunrise from the peak where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Budget: $60-90; bring warm layers for the mountain.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Naama Bay Promenade</h4>
        <p>The original heart of Sharm's resort development, Naama Bay offers a pleasant waterfront promenade lined with restaurants, cafes, and shops. It's the most walkable and atmospheric area — less glitzy than newer developments but more charming. Good for evening strolls, casual dining, and souvenir shopping. The beach here is adequate though not the best for snorkeling.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Old Market (Sharm el Maya)</h4>
        <p>Near where tenders arrive, the Old Market provides an authentic Egyptian bazaar experience. Stalls sell spices, perfume oils, papyrus, scarves, and typical souvenirs. Bargaining is expected and part of the fun — start at 50% of the asking price. The market also has simple local restaurants serving Egyptian staples like koshary and falafel at prices far below resort rates.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Colored Canyon Desert Safari</h4>
        <p>For those who've had enough of water, the Colored Canyon offers a complete change of scenery. This narrow desert gorge features layered sandstone in shades of red, yellow, purple, and white — a geological painting millions of years in the making. The excursion includes 4x4 desert driving, hiking through the canyon, and Bedouin tea. Budget: $55-75 for half-day trips.</p>

      <!-- Getting Around -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around Sharm el-Sheikh</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Sharm is spread out but easy to navigate.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taxis</h4>
        <p>The primary way to move between areas. Most taxis are not metered — agree on the price before departure. Standard fares: marina to Naama Bay 50-75 EGP ($2-3 USD); marina to Sharks Bay 100-150 EGP ($4-6 USD). Taxis wait at the tender pier. Agree in USD or EGP depending on which you have.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Shore Excursions</h4>
        <p>For diving, Ras Mohammed, Tiran Island, St. Catherine's, and desert safaris, organized tours are the practical choice. Book through the ship or reputable local operators. Pickup from the tender marina is standard. Having a guide also navigates cultural and language barriers.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Walking</h4>
        <p>Possible within individual areas (Naama Bay promenade, Old Market) but not between districts. The desert heat and distance between areas make walking between neighborhoods impractical. Save your energy for snorkeling and reef walks.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Rental Cars</h4>
        <p>Not recommended for cruise passengers with limited time. Desert driving requires local knowledge, and organized tours provide better value for single-day visits.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Local Food & Drink -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Egyptian flavors and Red Sea refreshment.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Egyptian Specialties</h4>
        <p><strong>Koshary:</strong> Egypt's national dish — a hearty mix of rice, lentils, pasta, chickpeas, and crispy onions topped with spicy tomato sauce. Cheap, filling, and delicious. Find it at local restaurants in Old Market for 30-50 EGP ($1-2).</p>
        <p><strong>Ful medames:</strong> Slow-cooked fava beans seasoned with olive oil, lemon, and garlic. A breakfast staple throughout Egypt, often served with pita bread.</p>
        <p><strong>Mezze:</strong> Shared appetizer platters including hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves, and fresh pita. Perfect for sampling multiple flavors.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fresh Seafood</h4>
        <p>Unsurprisingly excellent in a Red Sea resort. Grilled fish (often sea bass, grouper, or red snapper), calamari, and prawns feature on most menus. Many restaurants display fresh catches for you to choose from before cooking.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Drinks</h4>
        <p><strong>Fresh juice:</strong> Mango, guava, strawberry, and mixed fruit juices served cold and sweet. Freshly squeezed and inexpensive.</p>
        <p><strong>Arabic coffee:</strong> Strong, often flavored with cardamom. Traditionally served in small cups without milk.</p>
        <p><strong>Tea (shai):</strong> Black tea served strong and sweet, sometimes with fresh mint.</p>
        <p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Available in hotel restaurants and tourist areas but not widely available. Egypt is a Muslim-majority country with conservative attitudes toward public drinking.</p>

      <!-- Pro Tips -->

        <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Things I wish I'd known before my first visit.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bring Cash:</strong> Small US dollar bills work everywhere and save exchange headaches. Bring $1, $5, and $10 bills for tips, taxis, and market purchases. ATMs exist but lines can be long.</li>
          <li><strong>Reef-Safe Sunscreen:</strong> Sharm's reefs are treasures — use only reef-safe, mineral-based sunscreen (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide). Many chemical sunscreens harm coral.</li>
          <li><strong>Water Shoes:</strong> Rocky beach entries and potential sea urchins make water shoes essential for reef snorkeling. They also protect against sharp coral.</li>
          <li><strong>Modest Dress:</strong> While resorts are relaxed, cover shoulders and knees when visiting Old Market or venturing beyond tourist areas. This shows respect and avoids unwanted attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Bargaining:</strong> Expected in markets and with taxi drivers. Start at 50% of asking price and negotiate cheerfully. Walking away often brings the price down.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping Culture:</strong> Baksheesh (tipping) is customary. Guides expect $5-10 per person for good service; restroom attendants 5-10 EGP; small services deserve small tips.</li>
          <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Always ask before photographing people. Military and government installations are off-limits. Underwater cameras or phones in waterproof cases capture amazing reef memories.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> The desert climate is deceptively dehydrating. Drink more water than seems necessary, especially before and after snorkeling or diving.</li>
          <li><strong>Book Diving in Advance:</strong> If you're a certified diver, book dive excursions before arrival. Popular sites fill quickly, and pre-booking ensures you don't miss Ras Mohammed or Tiran Island.</li>
        </ul>
