Unpredictable entertainment sent him into shutdown. We'd stopped attending any live performance because the chaos was too much.\n\nGetaway's [Illusionarium](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-getaway.html) changed everything.\n\nThis dinner-magic show seemed like the worst possible idea\u2014strangers, loud noises, interactive performance. But my wife researched it thoroughly. 'It's structured,' she said. 'Same show every night. Same magic tricks in same order. Lucas can predict what happens.'\n\nThe first night, we sat in the back, ready to leave. Lucas gripped my hand so hard it hurt.\n\nThen the magician appeared. And Lucas... relaxed.\n\nThe structure was precisely what his brain needed. Every trick followed patterns. The audience participation was voluntary\u2014no one forced involvement. When Lucas figured out how one illusion worked (three nights of watching the same show), he whispered his theory to me with more excitement than I'd seen in years.\n\n'Dad. I know how he does it. Watch his left hand.'\n\nHe was right.\n\nThe magician noticed Lucas's intensity by night four. After the show, he approached our table. 'I see a fellow observer,' he said, speaking to Lucas without forcing eye contact. 'Would you like to see how one trick works? Just between us?'\n\nLucas said yes. First word he'd spoken to a stranger in months.\n\n**The lesson:** Getaway's Illusionarium works for neurodiverse guests because of its structure.",

He proposed on the same beach three years later. Miami was ours.\n\nWhen he died, I couldn't face the city. Too many memories. Too much him.\n\nBut Getaway sailed from Miami. And somehow, boarding a cruise that departed from our place felt right. Like honoring him instead of avoiding him.\n\n[The Waterfront](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-getaway.html) became my morning ritual. Coffee at sunrise, watching Miami's skyline shrink as we sailed toward the Caribbean. Some mornings I cried. Others I just breathed. The crew learned to leave me alone unless I looked up.\n\nBy the third cruise day, I felt something I hadn't expected: gratitude. Not for his death\u2014never that\u2014but for Miami. For forty years of South Beach sunsets. For the love that started where this ship was now leaving.\n\nA crew member named Sofia noticed my wedding ring. She didn't ask questions, but she brought me a flower one morning. 'For whoever you're remembering,' she said. 'The sea carries love. It never disappears.'\n\n**The truth:** Getaway's Miami sailings let grieving guests return to meaningful ports. Starting from familiar ground can ease the journey into the unknown.\n\n---\n\n**Planning a cruise after loss?** Read: [In the Wake of Grief: When Loss Needs Water](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html).\n\nI cruise from Miami annually now.

Grandpa walked to the edge of the platform, looked down at the churning Caribbean, and for a moment I thought he'd turn back.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nHe walked to the very end, stood there for ten seconds, then shuffled back.
