That&#x27;s the quiet charm of Rhapsody of the Seas, Royal Caribbean&#x27;s Vision Class treasure born at Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique in Saint-Nazaire, France, with her keel laid in 1995 and launch on July 19, 1996. Debuting on May 19, 1997, from Galveston, she was heralded as an innovative vessel at 78,491 gross tons, targeting families, couples, and thrill-seekers hungry for award-winning entertainment and electrifying nightlife on adventure-driven escapes. Royal Caribbean marketed her as one of the boldest ships for once-in-a-lifetime thrills, spotlighting her stunning Centrum atrium—a multi-level hub of live music and aerial shows that feels like an immersive epicenter of energy [Image of Rhapsody of the Seas: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rhapsody_of_the_Seas_(ship,_1997)_001.jpg].For families chasing unforgettable activities, Rhapsody provides venues where multi-generational bonds form seamlessly.
