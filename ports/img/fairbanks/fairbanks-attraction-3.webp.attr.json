  "description": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_W._Geist\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Otto W. Geist\">Otto W. Geist</a> (1888-1963) left a considerable mark on what is now the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alaska_Fairbanks\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:University of Alaska Fairbanks\">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a> during his association with the university in the middle 20th century.  Despite coming from a mining background and lacking a terminal degree, his renown as an archaeologist and paleontologist rivaled that of more credentialed colleagues.  Shown in this photo are two memorials.  In the foreground is Geist Road, a major thoroughfare in the western suburbs of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Fairbanks\">Fairbanks</a>.  Geist Road runs along the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_line\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:section line\">section line</a> marking the southern edge of the UAF campus.  In the background is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alaska_Museum_of_the_North\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:University of Alaska Museum of the North\">University of Alaska Museum of the North</a>.  Various buildings housing the museum over the decades have been formally known as the Otto W. Geist Building, including this one.",
