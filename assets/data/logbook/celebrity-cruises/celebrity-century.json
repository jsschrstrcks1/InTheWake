The Michel Roux restaurant. The focus on culinary excellence. The design sensibility that prioritized elegance over excess.\n\nShe was the first of the Century Class\u2014followed by Galaxy and Mercury. Together, they established Celebrity as the premium alternative to mass-market cruising. Before these ships, the line was still finding its identity.\n\nCentury introduced the modern dining concepts that Millennium Class would expand and Edge Class would perfect. The innovation started here. The excellence originated aboard this ship.\n\n**The truth:** Century represents Celebrity's foundation. Understanding this ship explains everything that followed. Her departure from the fleet marked an era's end.\n\nThose who sailed Century remember what she pioneered. The ship that defined the line has left, but her legacy sails on every Celebrity vessel.",

      "markdown": "**The Grand Restaurant on Century was where Celebrity's culinary reputation was born.**\n\n[Celebrity Century](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-century.html) featured Michel Roux-designed cuisine that shocked the cruise industry. Actual fine dining at sea. Techniques that belonged in Michelin-starred restaurants. Standards that seemed impossible aboard ships.\n\nThe two-deck Grand Restaurant created atmosphere that Millennium's Metropolitan would echo. The presentation. The service. The understanding that dining was experience, not just fuel.\n\n'This isn't cruise ship food,' passengers would observe, surprised.\n\n'This is Celebrity food,' servers would reply. 'Century is where it started.'\n\nThe menu rotations. The wine service. The pastry that showed actual training. Everything that makes Celebrity dining exceptional today traces back to Century's Grand Restaurant.\n\n**The truth:** Century's dining innovations became Celebrity's identity. The ship has left the fleet, but her culinary legacy remains the foundation.\n\nThose who dined aboard Century remember the revelation. The first taste of what Celebrity could be.",

She was the future of cruising.**\n\n[Celebrity Century](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-century.html) arrived in an industry that hadn't seen her like. The design. The proportions. The sense that ships could be elegant rather than merely large.\n\nAt 1,870 passengers, Century felt intimate compared to today's mega-ships. But in 1996, she was modern. Sophisticated. The ship that proved cruising could attract travelers who'd never considered it.\n\n'This is different from other cruise ships,' I told friends afterward.\n\n'This is what cruise ships should become,' I believed.\n\nI was right. Century's innovations\u2014the Murano glass, the culinary program, the design philosophy\u2014became the industry standard. She shaped what we expect from premium cruising.\n\n**The truth:** Century proved what cruising could be. The ship has left the fleet, but her influence shaped everything that followed.\n\nThose who sailed Century early remember the amazement. The ship that showed what was possible.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment.",

The ship that started it all moved on to new owners, new waters, new passengers.\n\nThose final voyages drew passengers who'd sailed her for years. Returning to say goodbye. Photographing spaces they'd come to love. Grieving a ship as one grieves a friend.\n\n'Ships shouldn't feel like home,' someone said at the farewell dinner.\n\n'Century did,' another replied. 'That was her gift.'\n\nShe became SkySea Golden Era for Chinese waters. A different life. A different name. But the bones remain\u2014the ship that taught Celebrity what excellence meant.\n\n**The truth:** Century's departure hurt because she'd meant so much.
