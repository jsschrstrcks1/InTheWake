    <article class="card"><h1>Cannes: Where Cinema Met the Sea</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Cannes doesn't announce itself with a pier—it invites you in gently, by tender, the ship anchored offshore like a patient guest waiting to be welcomed. The moment our tender rounded the breakwater and I saw the sweep of La Croisette unfurling along the bay—that famous palm-shaded promenade with its art deco hotel palaces gleaming white and cream against the Mediterranean blue—I understood why this town of some 74,000 souls has captured the world's imagination since long before the first film festival unfurled its red carpet in 1946.</p>

        <p>There's a story they tell here, about an English traveler named Lord Brougham who was quarantined in Cannes in 1834 during a cholera outbreak. He couldn't proceed to Italy as planned, so he stayed. And stayed. And fell so deeply in love with this fishing village that he built a villa and spent every winter here until his death, bringing along the British aristocracy in his wake. Cannes owes its transformation from quiet harbor to glittering resort to a man who was forced to stop—and chose to remain. I think about that every time I step off a tender here: sometimes the detours become the destinations.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/cannes/cannes-1.webp" alt="Cannes harbor view" loading="lazy">

      </figure>

        <p>La Croisette stretches before you like a promise kept. This wasn't always so polished—the promenade took its current form in 1960, when they created artificial beaches and formalized what had been a more casual shoreline into this grand sweep of elegance. I walked it in the early morning, when the palm shadows were still long and cool, past the private beach clubs with their neat rows of loungers waiting for the day's parade of sunbathers. The hotels—Carlton, Martinez, Majestic—rise like monuments to a more glamorous age, their belle époque facades watching over everything with benevolent grandeur.</p>

        <p>The Palais des Festivals et des Congrès sits at the heart of the Croisette, a modern building that opened in 1982 to replace an earlier casino-turned-festival hall. This is the beating heart of the Cannes Film Festival, that impossibly glamorous gathering each May that has made this city synonymous with cinema since 1946. The handprints of stars are set into the pavement outside—I put my hand in Marion Cotillard's print and felt the strange thrill of touching a place where art and celebrity intersect. The Palais hosts more than just films: the NRJ Music Awards, the Cannes Lions advertising festival—it's a year-round temple to creativity. But in May, during the festival, this entire town transforms into something electric, a celebration of storytelling that draws the world's gaze.</p>

        <p>I wanted to see the Cannes that existed before the cameras arrived, so I climbed west up into Le Suquet, the oldest quarter of town perched above the Vieux Port. The streets narrow and twist as you ascend, the buildings pressing close in that medieval way, their shutters painted in faded ochres and soft greens. This is 14th-century Cannes, built when the town was more concerned with watching for pirates than premieres. At the summit stands the 12th-century castle—fortified stone walls that now house the Musée de la Castre, with its collections ranging from ethnography to antiquities. The views from up here are extraordinary: the bay sweeping east toward Antibes, the Lérins Islands floating offshore, and below, the geometric perfection of modern Cannes laid out like a promise of what prosperity and beauty can build together.</p>

        <p>Just beside the castle, I found Notre-Dame d'Espérance, a Gothic church whose name means "Our Lady of Hope." It's a quiet, cool refuge from the glamour below—stone and stained glass, candles flickering in the dimness, the smell of old incense. I sat in a pew and listened to the silence, thinking about how every glittering resort needs its still, sacred places.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
        <img src="img/cannes/cannes-2.webp" alt="Cannes waterfront" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Cannes scenery — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Cannes&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>Back down in the gleaming streets, I surrendered to the pleasures of shopping. Rue d'Antibes runs parallel to the Croisette, a long avenue of boutiques and shops where you can find everything from haute couture to Provençal linens. The Boulevard de la Croisette itself is lined with the flagship stores of luxury brands, their windows dressed like works of art. I didn't buy much—a small bottle of lavender honey, a silk scarf the color of the sea—but I enjoyed the looking, the sense of abundance and care that Cannes brings to even the smallest commercial transaction.</p>

        <p>Lunch was salade niçoise and cold rosé at one of the private beach clubs along La Croisette—Plage Croisette, with its white umbrellas and attentive service. The water was impossibly clear, that particular Mediterranean blue-green that seems lit from within. I swam out past the roped area and floated on my back, watching the palms sway and the hotel facades gleam, thinking about Lord Brougham and that first reluctant winter he spent here. Lucky man, to be forced into paradise.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon, I took the ferry to Île Sainte-Marguerite—just twenty minutes offshore, but a world away from the polished elegance of the mainland. Pine forests, secret coves, the fortress where the Man in the Iron Mask was supposedly imprisoned. I found a hidden inlet and swam in water so still it felt like floating in liquid light. When I looked back toward Cannes, the city shimmered across the water like a mirage, all those art deco dreams and film festival fantasies glowing in the slanting afternoon sun. The contrast is what makes Cannes unforgettable: the glamour and the wildness, the red carpets and the rough stone, the place where cinema met the sea and decided to stay.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at the ramparts of the old castle in Le Suquet at sunset, watching the light turn the bay to molten gold, and understanding that Cannes is not just about the famous people who visit each May—it's about the light, the way the Mediterranean holds the town in its ancient blue embrace, and the way a place can be both a stage and a sanctuary, depending on where you choose to look.

        <h3>Getting Around Cannes</h3>
        <p>Cannes is a tender port—your ship will anchor offshore in the bay, and you'll take a tender boat to the Vieux Port (Old Port), which puts you right at the western edge of town. From there, everything unfolds beautifully on foot. La Croisette promenade stretches east along the waterfront for about two kilometers, perfectly walkable and lined with shade-giving palms. The Palais des Festivals is about a 5-minute walk from the tender landing, and Le Suquet's medieval streets begin their climb just west of the port.</p>

        <p>If you want to explore the Lérins Islands—particularly Île Sainte-Marguerite with its fortress and pine forests—ferries depart from the Vieux Port every 30 minutes or so during the cruise season. The crossing takes about 20 minutes. Tickets can be purchased at the kiosk by the harbor; I recommend going in the afternoon when the day-trippers have thinned out and you can have the coves more to yourself.</p>

        <p>For those who want to venture further afield, local buses run along the coast to Antibes and other Riviera towns, but honestly, Cannes itself offers more than enough for a perfect port day. Everything you need—beaches, history, shopping, dining—is within a leisurely 20-minute walk of where the tender lands you.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

        <p><strong>Beach Strategy:</strong> The public beaches along La Croisette fill quickly, especially in summer. If you want the full Cannes experience, consider splurging on a private beach club (plage privée)—they range from €20-40 per person for a lounger, umbrella, and access to facilities. Plage Croisette and others along the boulevard offer attentive service, clean facilities, and that particular French Riviera elegance. It's worth it for the experience, at least once.</p>

        <p><strong>Timing for Le Suquet:</strong> The climb up to the old quarter and castle is steep but short—wear comfortable shoes. The narrow streets can be hot in midday summer sun, so I recommend going in the morning or late afternoon when the light is softer and the stone glows.</p>

        <p><strong>Film Festival Season:</strong> If you visit during the Cannes Film Festival in May, the town transforms completely. Red carpets appear, security intensifies, and the Croisette becomes a celebrity parade. It's thrilling to witness, but also more crowded and expensive. Book any beach clubs or restaurants well in advance during festival weeks.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency & Cards:</strong> France uses the Euro. Credit cards are widely accepted, but smaller shops and beach vendors may prefer cash. ATMs are plentiful along Rue d'Antibes and the Croisette.</p>

        <p><strong>Language:</strong> French is the native language, but English is widely spoken in the tourist areas along La Croisette and at the Palais. A few words of French—"bonjour," "merci," "s'il vous plaît"—go a long way toward warm interactions.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Cannes worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br/>
        A: Absolutely. Cannes offers the perfect combination of French Riviera glamour and accessible culture. You can walk the legendary La Croisette promenade, explore medieval Le Suquet, relax on beautiful beaches, and even escape to a wild island—all within a single port day. It's not just for film festival season; Cannes is enchanting year-round.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to spend a day in Cannes?</strong><br/>
        A: My ideal Cannes day: Start with a morning stroll along La Croisette to the Palais des Festivals, then climb up to Le Suquet to explore the medieval quarter and visit the castle museum. Come back down for lunch at a beach club, spend the afternoon swimming and relaxing, and if you have time, take the ferry to Île Sainte-Marguerite for a completely different experience—pine forests and hidden coves just offshore.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How long does it take to visit Île Sainte-Marguerite?</strong><br/>
        A: Budget about 3-4 hours for a round-trip visit including the 20-minute ferry crossing each way. That gives you time to explore the fortress, walk through the pine forests, and swim in one of the secluded coves. Ferries run frequently from the Vieux Port.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I get from the cruise ship to town?</strong><br/>
        A: Cannes is a tender port, so your ship will anchor offshore and you'll take a tender boat directly to the Vieux Port (Old Port). From there, you're an easy 5-minute walk to the Palais des Festivals and La Croisette. Everything in central Cannes is walkable from the tender landing.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Do I need to book anything in advance?</strong><br/>
        A: Not necessarily, unless you're visiting during the Film Festival in May, when the town is packed and restaurants/beach clubs book up. For a regular cruise visit, you can book beach clubs when you arrive, and the island ferries don't require advance tickets. The town is wonderfully set up for walk-up exploration.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Cannes expensive?</strong><br/>
        A: Cannes can be as expensive or affordable as you make it. Yes, it's a luxury destination with high-end hotels and beach clubs, but you can also enjoy the public beaches, walk the Croisette for free, explore Le Suquet without charge, and find reasonably priced cafes on the side streets. A private beach club splurge (€20-40) is worth it for the experience, but not required for a wonderful day.</p>

    <h3>Author's Note</h3>
    <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
      Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake. I've researched and written this guide with care — drawing on firsthand accounts, historical sources, and practical logistics — but I haven't yet walked these shores or felt the Mediterranean light that makes Cannes legendary. When I do visit, I'll return to these pages and add the textures that only direct experience brings: the exact feel of palm shadows on La Croisette, the particular view from Le Suquet's castle ramparts, the taste of rosé at a beach club with my toes in the sand. Until then, consider this a chart drawn from trusted navigators, waiting for my own sextant reading to confirm its accuracy.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Cannes is red carpets, rosé on the beach, and the Croisette promenade that makes you feel like you're in a French movie – even without the film festival.
