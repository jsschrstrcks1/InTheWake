        <p>"I've seen Grease on Broadway and honestly, this production held its own. The cast was incredibly talented — Danny's voice was perfect, and the T-Birds had genuine chemistry.

      <h3>Royal Theater Review: Broadway Comes to Sea</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> As someone who sees 10-15 Broadway shows a year, I approached Royal Theater with skepticism. "Cruise ship entertainment" doesn't exactly scream quality. I was wrong. Royal Caribbean has genuinely invested in bringing Broadway-caliber productions to sea, and it shows.</p>

      <h4>The Venue</h4>
      <p>Royal Theater on Symphony of the Seas is a proper theater — 1,400 plush seats across orchestra and balcony levels, excellent sightlines from almost every seat, and production values that rival mid-size Broadway houses. The sound system is well-calibrated, the lighting rig is sophisticated, and the stage can accommodate complex sets and effects.</p>

      <h4>The Productions</h4>
      <p>We saw Mamma Mia! on our cruise, and it was genuinely excellent. The cast was professional — these are performers who could work on any major stage. The leads had powerful voices, the ensemble was tight, and the choreography was polished. The costumes and sets transported you to Greece. By "Dancing Queen," the entire audience was on their feet.</p>

      <h4>Beyond Broadway</h4>
      <p>The variety of entertainment impressed me. Beyond the headline musical, we caught a comedy show (genuinely funny, not cruise-ship-cheesy), a magic act that rivaled Vegas performers, and a welcome show that set the tone for the cruise. Every evening offered something worth seeing.</p>

      <h4>Practical Notes</h4>
      <p>The two-showtime system works well — pick the time that fits your dinner schedule. We preferred the late show (9:30 PM) as it was less crowded. Arrive 15 minutes early for good seats; orchestra center is ideal. The theater serves drinks before the show and during intermission.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Royal Theater exceeded my admittedly low expectations. The production quality rivals what you'd pay $150+ for on Broadway, and it's included in your cruise. <strong>Rating: 4.6/5.</strong> See at least two shows during your cruise — the headline production plus one variety show. You'll be impressed.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Which Royal Theater show is best?</strong></summary>
        <p>This depends on your taste, but the licensed Broadway productions (Grease, Mamma Mia!, Hairspray) consistently receive the highest praise. Original productions like We Will Rock You are also excellent. Don't sleep on the comedy shows — they're often surprisingly good.</p>
