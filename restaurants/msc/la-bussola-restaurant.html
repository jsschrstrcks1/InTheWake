      <h3>La Bussola Restaurant Review: Compass Points to Solid Italian Dining</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> La Bussola ("The Compass") is a complimentary main dining room found aboard several MSC vessels, offering the traditional multi-course, assigned-seating dinner experience. It shares the same rotating nightly menu as other main dining rooms on the ship, with MSC's characteristic Italian/Mediterranean emphasis. As one of the fleet's primary included dining venues, it serves most guests on most evenings.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The Italian dishes carry the menu reliably. The tagliatelle al ragù is a highlight — properly al dente pasta with a patient, slow-cooked meat sauce. The caprese salad starter uses surprisingly good mozzarella for a cruise ship, and the bruschetta is crisp and well-topped. The veal Milanese is a strong ordering choice when it appears — golden-breaded, tender, and served with a lemon wedge and arugula that lift it. Risotto preparations are consistently well-executed across the fleet. Where it falls short: international options lack conviction — the grilled salmon is often overcooked, the roast chicken can be bland, and "Asian-inspired" dishes feel like afterthoughts. The bread basket is above average (focaccia and grissini), but butter service can be slow. Desserts are predictable but satisfying — the panna cotta is silky and the tiramisu holds up night after night. The house wine (especially Italian reds) offers genuine value at $7-$9 per glass.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The assigned-waiter system is La Bussola's quiet strength. By the second evening, your server remembers your wine preference and your habit of ordering extra bread. MSC's international crew brings warmth and professionalism, with the European pacing (slower than American cruise lines) allowing multi-course dinners to unfold naturally. The sommelier visits regularly and makes genuine recommendations. First-seating service is consistently better-paced than second, which can feel compressed on port nights.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>La Bussola typically features the classic MSC main dining room design — multi-level, chandelier-lit, with the grand staircase entrance that makes dinner feel like an event. The decor is elegant but not stuffy, with warm tones and nautical-compass design elements that reference the venue's name. Noise can be a factor at full capacity, particularly in the main level — upper-level balcony seating tends to be quieter and more intimate if you can request it.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.7/5.</strong> La Bussola is a dependable complimentary dining room that plays to MSC's Italian strengths — the pasta courses, risottos, and classic Italian mains are consistently enjoyable, and the assigned-waiter system creates genuine hospitality over the voyage. It loses marks for uninspired international offerings and noise levels at peak capacity. <em>Tip:</em> never skip the pasta course, even if you order it as a half-portion alongside your main — it's reliably the kitchen's best work every night.</p>
