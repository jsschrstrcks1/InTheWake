<section><h3>The SuperLiner Era Begins</h3><p>At 46,052 GT, Holiday was the largest ship Carnival had ever operated. She launched the SuperLiner revolution—ships so large they offered experiences smaller vessels couldn't accommodate. More venues, more entertainment, more space for celebration. The size jump wasn't incremental; it was revolutionary. Every mega-ship sailing today traces ambitions back to Holiday's pioneering scale.</p></section>

<section><h3>Legacy</h3><p>The SuperLiner experiment Holiday pioneered became industry standard. Every cruise line now builds large ships. The size arms race Holiday started continues today with ships exceeding 230,000 GT. Her legacy isn't just size—Holiday proved that larger ships could be profitable, that scale created efficiency, that passengers preferred more options to fewer. The Holiday Class template informed every generation that followed.</p></section>
