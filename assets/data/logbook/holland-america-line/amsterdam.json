      "markdown": "**For years, Amsterdam was synonymous with the Grand World Voyage.**\n\n[Amsterdam](/ships/holland-america-line/amsterdam.html) joined the fleet in 2000 as the final R-Class ship, and quickly became HAL's world cruise flagship. Her annual circumnavigations drew a devoted following of travelers who planned years around her schedule.\n\nThe world cruise community was tight-knit. Passengers who completed multiple world voyages formed lasting friendships. The ship became their annual home, the crew their extended family.\n\nAt 1,380 passengers, Amsterdam offered the intimate scale that world cruising demands. Four months at sea requires community, and her size enabled exactly that.\n\n**The legacy:** Amsterdam defined what world cruising meant for Holland America. The ship has retired, but her world cruise heritage continues.\n\nThose who completed Grand World Voyages on Amsterdam remember those months vividly. The flagship that circled the globe.",

We watched them all.**\n\n[Amsterdam](/ships/holland-america-line/amsterdam.html) featured a forward-facing observation lounge where world cruise passengers gathered daily. Coffee and sunrise over new continents. Cocktails and sunset approaching exotic ports.\n\nDuring our world voyage, the Crow's Nest became headquarters. Same seats, same companions, same bartender knowing our preferences. The view changed—Sydney, Mumbai, Cape Town—but the community remained constant.\n\nWeather systems crossed the horizon. Whales surfaced in unexpected places. The world revealed itself through those windows while we sat in comfortable familiarity.\n\n**The view:** Amsterdam's Crow's Nest provided the perspective world voyages require. The lounge that watched the entire planet.\n\nThose who claimed Crow's Nest seats on Amsterdam remember the views. The world observed from a floating living room.",

She completed what Statendam began.**\n\n[Amsterdam](/ships/holland-america-line/amsterdam.html) arrived in 2000 as the seventh and final R-Class vessel—the design that modernized Holland America through the 1990s. Everything the class learned across six prior ships informed her construction.\n\nThe R-Class represented HAL's mid-sized philosophy at its peak. Not too large to overwhelm, not too small to limit. The scale that worked for what HAL passengers wanted.\n\nAll seven R-Class ships have now retired from the fleet. Amsterdam was among the last to go. The class that defined an era completed its service.\n\n**The completion:** Amsterdam showed what R-Class refinement achieved. The final expression of a successful design.\n\nFleet historians recognize Amsterdam's significance. The ship that completed a defining class.",
