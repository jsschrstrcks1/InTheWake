          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The tender bounced across swells as we approached Hanga Roa, and through the spray I caught my first glimpse of what I'd traveled halfway around the world to see—stone faces on the hillside, massive and unmistakable, watching our approach from a distance of two thousand years. My wife grabbed my arm, and neither of us spoke. There are moments in travel when words become inadequate, when the only honest response is silence. Easter Island—Rapa Nui to those who know her intimately—had been a dream since childhood, a place so improbable that I half-expected it to disappoint. Yet here we were, climbing from the tender onto a concrete pier, the Pacific stretching empty in every direction, and those stone ancestors regarding us with expressions that seemed neither welcoming nor hostile but simply eternal.</p>

            <p>We joined a tour that began at Ahu Tongariki, and I understood immediately why this is the island's most photographed site. Fifteen moai stood in a row on a ceremonial platform, their backs to the ocean, facing inland to watch over the communities they once protected. The largest weighed eighty-eight tons. They ranged from twelve to eighteen feet tall. A 1960 tsunami scattered them like broken toys across the landscape; Japanese archaeologists spent three years restoring them in the 1990s. I walked the length of the platform, touching nothing, feeling the volcanic rock radiate warmth from the morning sun. The silence was profound—wind through grass, distant waves, nothing else. My wife stood at the end of the row photographing the moai against the sky, and I thought about the people who carved these giants with nothing but stone tools, who believed so completely in their ancestors' power that they devoted generations to creating monuments visible from the sea.</p>

            <p>Rano Raraku changed everything. The quarry where ninety-five percent of all moai were carved sits on the outer slope of an extinct volcano, and nearly four hundred statues remain there in various stages of completion. Some lie face-down, abandoned mid-transport. Others stand buried to their shoulders in centuries of accumulated soil, only their massive heads visible above the grass. Still others remain attached to the bedrock, half-carved, their features emerging from the volcanic tuff as if they were being born rather than created. I climbed the path through this field of giants, stopping every few feet to examine another face, another style, another story frozen in stone. The famous "El Gigante" lies unfinished near the crater rim—seventy feet tall, the largest moai ever attempted, abandoned when the civilization collapsed. I stood beside it feeling the weight of ambition interrupted, of faith exceeded by circumstance. Tears came without warning, streaming down my face as my heart swelled with something between grief and wonder. My wife found me there, and we held each other without speaking, overwhelmed by what humans had achieved and lost on this remote speck of Pacific volcanic rock. I felt privileged to stand where ancestors still watch over their descendants, grateful and thankful for the chance to witness what most people only see in photographs.</p>

            <p>The guide explained what scholars believe happened: deforestation, overpopulation, resource depletion, conflict. The Rapa Nui people cut down every tree on the island—originally subtropical forest—to roll moai from the quarry to their platforms. Without trees, soil eroded. Without canoes, fishing declined. Clans warred over diminishing resources. The moai-building stopped. Many statues were toppled in conflicts. By the time Europeans arrived in 1722, the population had crashed from perhaps fifteen thousand to a few thousand. Disease and slave raids would reduce it further. Yet the culture survived. The language survived. The pride survived. Today's six thousand residents are rebuilding what was nearly lost, and tourism—carefully managed—provides the means.</p>

            <p>We ended the day at Ahu Tahai, walking distance from Hanga Roa, where five moai stand above the Pacific and one wears restored eyes of white coral and black obsidian. The sun set behind us, and the moai became silhouettes against a sky of orange and purple and gold. The smell of grilling fish drifted from somewhere nearby, and my mouth watered remembering the tuna ceviche we'd had for lunch—so fresh the ocean seemed to linger on my tongue. Local families gathered on the grass. Children ran between the monuments. Someone played a ukulele softly, the notes carrying across the evening breeze. I thought about what a blessing it is to visit a place this sacred, this fragile, this essential to understanding human capability and human folly. Easter Island isn't just an archaeological site. It's a mirror showing us what we can build when belief is strong enough, and what we can destroy when we forget that resources have limits.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing in Rano Raraku quarry as tears streamed down my face, surrounded by four hundred moai in various stages of completion, feeling the silence of a civilization's last great effort frozen in stone. Looking back, Easter Island taught me that ambition without sustainability leads to collapse—but also that what humans create in faith can outlast the civilizations that built them. The moai still stand. The lesson still applies.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Easter Island has no cruise pier—all ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to Hanga Roa harbor. Tender operations depend entirely on sea conditions; Pacific swells can delay or cancel access even on apparently calm days. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> typically include tender priority and <strong>guaranteed return</strong> coordination. <strong>Independent</strong> visitors should monitor ship announcements carefully and return early to avoid being stranded. Tender rides take approximately 15-20 minutes depending on conditions.</p>

            <p>Hanga Roa is the island's only town, home to nearly all six thousand residents. The tender landing puts you within walking distance of the town center with small shops, seafood restaurants, and the Rapa Nui Museum. Currency is Chilean Peso (CLP); US dollars accepted at tourist businesses. ATMs exist in town but lines can be long on cruise days. Credit cards are accepted at most establishments. The national park entrance fee ($80 USD for foreigners) is required for all archaeological sites and is valid for 10 days—<strong>book ahead</strong> or purchase at the park office in Hanga Roa.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate to high.</strong> Moai sites involve walking on uneven volcanic terrain, often with limited shade. Rano Raraku quarry requires hiking uphill on gravel paths. Ahu Tongariki has accessible viewing areas. Orongo ceremonial village involves steep climbs and stairs. The sun is intense and UV levels extreme—heat exhaustion is a real risk. Wheelchair users find Hanga Roa manageable; moai sites present significant challenges. Tours in air-conditioned vehicles with strategic stops are the most practical option for most visitors.</p>

        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Organized tours:</strong> Highly recommended for cruise visitors with limited time. Full-island tours ($100-180 USD per person) cover Rano Raraku, Ahu Tongariki, Anakena, and Orongo in 6-8 hours. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> provide <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and tender coordination. Local operators offer smaller groups but require independent tender management. <strong>Book ahead</strong> as capacity fills quickly when ships are in port.</p>

            <p><strong>Rental vehicles:</strong> Cars ($60-100 USD/day), motorcycles, and ATVs available in Hanga Roa. Roads are narrow, poorly marked, and unpaved in sections. Fuel is expensive ($8-10 USD/gallon). <strong>Independent</strong> exploration rewarding but challenging in one cruise day—navigation takes time away from sites. Recommended only for confident drivers with good time management.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Hanga Roa is compact and walkable. Ahu Tahai (five moai with restored eyes) is 2 km north—an easy 30-minute walk from the tender landing. Major moai sites (Rano Raraku, Ahu Tongariki) are 18-20 km from town; walking is impractical for cruise visitors. Level sidewalks in town; uneven terrain at archaeological sites.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available in Hanga Roa for fixed-rate transfers to major sites. Expect $40-60 USD round trip to Ahu Tongariki, $80-120 USD for multi-site circuits. Negotiate price before departure. More expensive than tours but offers flexibility. Limited availability; <strong>book ahead</strong> through your ship's concierge or the tourist office.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Hanga Roa has paved streets with some dropped curbs. Ahu Tongariki has an accessible viewing area with firm ground. Rano Raraku requires hiking on uneven volcanic terrain—not accessible. Orongo involves steep stairs and paths—not accessible. Anakena has packed sand manageable with assistance. Contact tour operators in advance for specific accessibility accommodations; some offer adapted vehicles.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Easter Island rewards thorough exploration, but cruise visitors must prioritize. The essential combination is Rano Raraku quarry (where moai were carved) and Ahu Tongariki (15 restored moai). Adding Orongo or Anakena creates a full-day itinerary. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($150-250 USD) provide <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to ship and handle tender logistics. <strong>Independent</strong> tours with local operators ($100-180 USD) offer smaller groups but require careful time management. <strong>Book ahead</strong>—capacity is limited and cruise days overwhelm supply.</p>

            <h3>Rano Raraku Quarry</h3>
            <p>The moai factory: 95% of all Easter Island moai were carved here from compressed volcanic ash (tuff). Nearly 400 statues remain in various stages of completion—some fully carved but still attached to bedrock, others buried to their shoulders in centuries of soil, one (El Gigante) 70 feet tall and never finished. Walking paths wind through the quarry; allow 2-3 hours minimum. The crater lake behind the quarry offers additional perspectives. Included in national park pass ($80 USD). Located 18 km east of Hanga Roa. Essential for understanding moai creation. Moderate to high stamina required—uphill hiking on volcanic terrain. Limited shade; bring water and sun protection.</p>

            <h3>Ahu Tongariki</h3>
            <p>The most photographed site on Easter Island: 15 restored moai standing in a row on the island's largest ceremonial platform. Moai range 12-18 feet tall; the largest weighs 88 tons. Spectacular at sunrise (golden light on moai faces). A 1960 tsunami scattered the statues; Japanese archaeologists restored them 1992-1995. Located 1 km from Rano Raraku—most tours combine both sites. Included in national park pass ($80 USD). Allow 1-2 hours. Low to moderate stamina; accessible viewing area with firm ground. Absolutely unmissable.</p>

            <h3>Orongo Ceremonial Village</h3>
            <p>Stone village perched on the rim of Rano Kau volcano (1,063 feet elevation) overlooking the Pacific. Site of the Birdman competition (discontinued late 1800s) where competitors raced to retrieve the first sooty tern egg from offshore islet Motu Nui. 53 restored stone houses with sod roofs. Petroglyphs depicting the Birdman deity. Stunning views of crater lake and ocean. Located 6 km southwest of Hanga Roa. Included in national park pass ($80 USD). Allow 2-3 hours. Moderate to high stamina—steep climb with stairs. Not wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <h3>Anakena Shore</h3>
            <p>Easter Island's finest white coral sand and palm trees (rare on the island) with turquoise swimming water. Two restored ahu with seven moai (Ahu Nau Nau and Ahu Ature Huki). Calm conditions for swimming and snorkeling. Vendors sell snacks and drinks ($5-15 USD). Located 20 km northeast of Hanga Roa. Often included as lunch stop on full-day tours. Free access (outside ahu viewing areas). Allow 1-2 hours. Low stamina for relaxation; swimming requires reasonable fitness. Surreal experience: Pacific swimming with moai watching over you.</p>

            <h3>Ahu Tahai</h3>
            <p>Restored moai complex within walking distance of Hanga Roa (2 km north along the coast). Three separate ahu with five moai total. The only moai with restored eyes (white coral, black obsidian pupils)—hauntingly lifelike. Perfect sunset location as moai silhouette against the Pacific. Free access. Allow 1-2 hours. Low stamina—flat coastal walk from town. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy and recommended if you have free time before or after organized tours.</p>

            <h3>Rapa Nui Museum</h3>
            <p>The island's best museum chronicling Polynesian settlement, moai construction, rongorongo script (undeciphered writing system), European contact, and modern Rapa Nui revival. Original moai eyes, carving tools, artifacts. Excellent context before or after visiting archaeological sites. Located north of Hanga Roa near Tahai. Admission approximately $5 USD. Allow 1-2 hours. Low stamina—climate-controlled interior ideal for midday heat escape. Accessible building with ramps.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>The moai:</strong> Eight hundred eighty-seven moai statues carved between 1250-1500 CE represent ancestors (aringa ora ata tepuna) watching over communities. They average 13 feet tall and 14 tons, though some reach 30 feet and 80 tons. The Rapa Nui carved them using only basalt hand tools—no metal, no wheels, no draft animals. How they moved multi-ton statues across miles of terrain remains debated; recent experiments suggest "walking" them upright using ropes and coordinated teams. The moai faced inland to protect villages; their backs to the sea guarded against ocean spirits.</p>

            <p><strong>Ecological collapse:</strong> Pollen analysis reveals Easter Island was once covered in subtropical forest, including the now-extinct Jubaea palm (Easter Island palm). The Rapa Nui cut down every tree—for canoes, for shelter, for moving moai. Without trees, soil eroded. Without canoes, fishing declined. Seabirds abandoned the deforested island. Food sources collapsed. Population crashed from perhaps 15,000 to a few thousand. The moai-building stopped. Clans warred over remaining resources. The statue-toppling began—enemies knocked down moai to break their power. By European contact in 1722, the civilization was in ruins.</p>

            <p><strong>European devastation:</strong> Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen arrived Easter Sunday 1722, naming the island accordingly. Subsequent European visits brought disease. In 1862, Peruvian slave raiders abducted roughly 1,500 islanders—half the remaining population—to work in guano mines. Those who survived and returned brought smallpox. By 1877, only 111 Rapa Nui remained. Chilean annexation in 1888 brought land seizures and confinement to Hanga Roa. The culture survived only through oral tradition and the stubborn memory of those who remained.</p>

            <p><strong>Rapa Nui revival:</strong> Today's six thousand residents are rebuilding what was nearly lost. The language is taught in schools. Traditional crafts are practiced and sold. Archaeological restoration continues with international support. Tourism—the island's primary economy—is carefully managed to prevent the overcrowding that threatens other Pacific islands. Visitors are asked to respect sacred sites, stay on marked paths, and remember that the moai are not merely monuments but ancestors. The Rapa Nui people's survival is itself a form of moai: ancestors watching over the future.</p>

              <summary>Which moai site should I prioritize?</summary>
              <p>Rano Raraku quarry (where 95% of moai were carved, nearly 400 statues in various stages) and Ahu Tongariki (15 restored moai in a row) are essential. Most full-day tours combine both. If choosing only one, pick Rano Raraku—understanding how moai were created transforms the entire experience. Ahu Tahai near Hanga Roa is excellent for sunset if you have extra time.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do I need to buy a national park pass?</summary>
              <p>Yes—the Rapa Nui National Park entrance fee ($80 USD for foreigners) is required for all archaeological sites including Rano Raraku, Ahu Tongariki, and Orongo. Valid for 10 days. Purchase at the park office in Hanga Roa or online in advance. Some ship excursions include it; others require separate purchase—confirm before booking.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How much time do I need to see Easter Island?</summary>
              <p>Most cruise calls are 8-12 hours. A comprehensive full-day tour (Rano Raraku, Ahu Tongariki, Orongo, Anakena) takes 6-8 hours. Allow 1-2 hours for Hanga Roa exploration and lunch. Everyone says "one day isn't enough"—they're right—but a focused day visiting the essential sites leaves lasting impressions.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What does "Rapa Nui" mean?</summary>
              <p>Rapa Nui is the Polynesian name for Easter Island, meaning "Big Rapa" (distinguishing it from Rapa Iti in French Polynesia). The island's original name was likely Te Pito O Te Henua ("The Navel of the World"). Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen arrived Easter Sunday 1722 and named it Easter Island. Locals prefer "Rapa Nui"—use it to show respect for the indigenous name.</p>

          <p class="author-note"><em>These soundings in another's wake reflect one family's experience. Easter Island overwhelmed us—the moai, the silence, the weight of what humans built and lost on this remote volcanic speck. The tears at Rano Raraku were unexpected but necessary. Some places demand emotional response. This is one.</em></p>
