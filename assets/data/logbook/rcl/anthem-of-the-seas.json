      "markdown": "**Margaret died eight months before I booked Anthem.**\n\nForty-two years married. Then suddenly: alone. Our kids kept saying \"get out of the house,\" but where? Everything reminded me of her. The grocery store where we shopped. The church we attended. Even the TV shows we watched together.\n\nI booked Anthem because Margaret had circled it in a cruise magazine. \"Look at that glass capsule,\" she'd said. \"I want to ride that.\" We never did.\n\nThe first three days, I ate alone at the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). The servers were kind, but pity is lonely company. I spent hours in [Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html), the venue with floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the ocean. Margaret would have loved it.\n\nI almost didn't book the [North Star](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/anthem-of-the-seas). \"For couples,\" I thought. But at 4am one night, insomnia won. I went to guest services and reserved the first morning slot \u2014 solo.\n\n300 feet above the ship. Glass capsule. Open ocean in every direction. Just me and the sunrise.\n\nAnd for the first time since Margaret died, I felt peace instead of absence. Not happiness \u2014 peace. The kind that comes from perspective, from realizing how vast the world is and how small our grief, even when it fills every room.\n\nI rode the North Star three more times that cruise. Always alone. Always early morning. Each time, I told Margaret what I saw. The coastline. The clouds. The way the ocean changes color at dawn.\n\nI'm not healed. Healing isn't linear. But Anthem gave me something I needed: permission to grieve *and* to keep living. See our [solo after loss guide](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html) and [widow/widower travel tips](/articles.html).",

      "markdown": "I'm not easily impressed by cruise ship tech. Robot bartenders? Gimmick. Virtual balconies? Fine, but not transformative. Apps for everything? Annoying when they glitch.\n\nBut Two70 on Anthem delivered.\n\nIt's a two-story venue at the aft of the ship. During the day: floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning ocean views. Perfect for reading, coffee, quiet conversation. At night: those windows become video screens. Robotic screens descend from the ceiling. The space transforms into a multimedia theater.\n\nThe shows blend live performers (dancers, aerialists, musicians), video projections that cover walls and ceiling, and choreography that uses the entire space. It's immersive without being gimmicky. Theatrical without being cheesy.\n\nI saw three different Two70 shows during my cruise. \"Spectra's Cabaret\" was the standout \u2014 live music, aerialists performing against shifting video backdrops, transitions that used the robotic screens to create depth and movement. My spouse (who hates cruise entertainment) leaned over mid-show: \"This is actually good.\"\n\nThe tech *serves* the performance instead of replacing it. That's rare on cruise ships, where innovation often means \"look what we can do\" instead of \"look what this enables.\"\n\nCompare Two70 to the Bionic Bar (robotic bartenders): the robots are fun to watch once, but the drinks aren't better. Two70's tech makes the shows *better*\u2014you couldn't create those performances without the video walls and robotic screens.\n\nIf you sail Anthem, don't skip Two70. Book show reservations early (seating fills fast). Arrive 10 minutes before showtime for good seats. And actually pay attention\u2014this isn't background entertainment you half-watch while scrolling your phone.\n\nSee [other Quantum-class ships](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html) for similar Two70 venues: [Ovation](/ships/rcl/ovation-of-the-seas.html), [Spectrum](/ships/rcl/spectrum-of-the-seas.html), [Odyssey](/ships/rcl/odyssey-of-the-seas.html).",

      "markdown": "**My daughter was terrified of heights. At thirteen, she wouldn't climb a ladder.**\n\nSo when she announced she wanted to try RipCord by iFly on Anthem, my wife and I exchanged glances. \"Are you sure, honey?\" She wasn't sure. But she wanted to try anyway.\n\nRipCord is indoor skydiving \u2014 a vertical wind tunnel on the back of the ship. You wear a flight suit and goggles, and instructors teach you the basics: chin up, arms out, relax. Then you step into 100+ mph wind and... float. The first session is 60 seconds. Feels like 6.\n\nEmma almost backed out three times. In the line. In the briefing room. At the chamber door. Each time, she'd look at us, take a breath, and keep going. The instructors were patient. They'd seen nervous kids before.\n\nShe stepped into that wind tunnel shaking.\n\nSixty seconds later, she came out grinning so hard she couldn't talk. The instructor had lifted her to the top of the chamber \u2014 thirty feet up \u2014 and she'd spread her arms like she was flying.\n\n\"Again,\" she said. \"I want to go again.\"\n\nWe booked two more sessions. By the third, she was doing spins. The same kid who wouldn't climb a ladder was doing aerial maneuvers with wind whipping her ponytail.\n\nThat moment \u2014 watching her transform from terrified to triumphant \u2014 is worth more than any waterslide or wave pool. It's the story we tell at family dinners. It's the story she'll tell her kids someday.\n\n**Practical notes:** RipCord fills up fast. Book your session the moment you board (go directly to the sports deck or use the app). Morning slots are less crowded. First-timers get a minute; return flyers can purchase longer sessions. There are weight and health restrictions \u2014 check Royal Caribbean's requirements before promising your kids.\n\nSee also: [SeaPlex](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/anthem-of-the-seas) for bumper cars and roller skating, and [North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) for more perspective-changing moments.",

      "markdown": "**My husband thought twelve days was too long. Five consecutive sea days? \"We'll be bored,\" he said.**\n\nWe almost booked a standard Caribbean seven-nighter instead. Same ship, familiar ports, predictable rhythm. Safe choice.\n\nBut I'd always wanted to cross the Atlantic by ship. Something about that journey \u2014 the way travelers used to do it \u2014 felt meaningful. So I talked him into Southampton to Cape Liberty. Twelve nights. Five sea days in a row mid-voyage.\n\nThose five days changed us.\n\nWithout ports to rush toward, we slowed down. We actually read books \u2014 whole books, not just airplane chapters. We had dinner conversations that lasted two hours because nobody was checking excursion times. We discovered the Solarium at 6am was nearly empty and became our morning coffee spot. We learned the bartenders' names.\n\nDay three at sea, we hit weather. Not dangerous \u2014 just gray skies, choppy water, rain streaking the windows. On a port-heavy cruise, that's a disaster. On a transatlantic, it was cozy. We watched movies in the cabin, napped, had tea in the Schooner Bar while rain pelted the glass. Nowhere to be. Nothing to miss.\n\nBy day five, the rhythm had settled into us. Early wake-up. Solarium. Breakfast at [Cafe Two70](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). Reading. Lunch. Afternoon trivia. Dinner at [Giovanni's](/restaurants.html) or the [main dining room](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html#dining-card). [Two70 show](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html). Nightcap. Sleep. Repeat.\n\nMy husband \u2014 the one who thought we'd be bored \u2014 asked on day seven: \"Can we do this again next year?\"\n\n**Why Anthem works for transatlantic:** The ship is mid-sized enough to feel navigable (you learn it in two days) but large enough to have variety. Two70 shows are excellent evening entertainment. The Solarium stays peaceful even on sea days. And the [North Star](/ships/rcl/anthem-of-the-seas.html) on a mid-Atlantic sunset is something you don't forget.\n\nTransatlantic sailings are often cheaper per night than standard cruises. They reposition the ship seasonally (Southampton summers, Caribbean winters), so availability is limited. Book early if you find one.\n\nSee our [planning guide](/planning.html) for booking strategies and [solo cruising](/solo/why-i-started-solo-cruising.html) for transatlantic alone.",
