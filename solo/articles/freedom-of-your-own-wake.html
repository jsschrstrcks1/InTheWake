  <h1>The Freedom of Your Own Wake</h1>
  <p class="dek">A gentle case for sailing alone: rest, rhythm, and room to breathe.</p>

  <p>No expectations. No demands. If I want to read by the rail with the wake for company, I do. If I want to try every soup on the menu, I do. Solo cruising isn’t about being alone; it’s about finally having space to breathe.</p>

  <p class="pill disclosure"><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> I’ve stood the watch aboard many ships—mostly Royal Caribbean—with more than 150 nights at sea across three oceans and over 30 nations. These are no borrowed winds, but soundings taken in my own wake.</p>
