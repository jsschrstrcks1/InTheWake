That&#x27;s the enduring magic of Enchantment of the Seas, Royal Caribbean&#x27;s Vision Class gem that has captivated hearts since her birth in the shipyards of Kvaerner Masa-Yards in Turku, Finland. Her keel was laid in 1995, launching on July 13, 1996, as the fourth Vision-class vessel, delivered in June 1997 with a maiden voyage from Oslo on July 13, 1997. At 81,000 gross tons and stretching 990 feet, Enchantment was marketed as an immersive escape, targeting families, first-time cruisers, and adventure seekers eager for world-class entertainment without overwhelming scale. Royal Caribbean positioned her as a gateway to incredible family vacations, emphasizing her innovative features like the iconic Centrum atrium—a soaring, light-filled heart of the ship that hosted aerial acrobatics and live music, creating epic moments that felt groundbreaking for the era [Image of Enchantment of the Seas: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Enchantment_of_the_Seas_(ship,_1997)_001.jpg].In her prime, Enchantment embodied Royal Caribbean&#x27;s commitment to thrilling experiences, sailing from ports like Baltimore, Tampa, and San Juan to the sun-kissed Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda, where ports like Cozumel, St. Maarten, and Perfect Day at CocoCay offered exclusive beach thrills and immersive explorations. A major milestone came in 2005 when she underwent a revolutionary &quot;stretch&quot;—as the only ship in the fleet to be extended by 73 feet at Kvaerner Masa-Yards, adding unique suspension bridges spanning more than 75 feet in the middle of her top deck, creating an architectural marvel that overlooks the pool area like soaring wings of adventure. This extension also introduced bungee trampolines (a first for cruising), an interactive splash deck, and enhanced dining options, boosting her capacity to 2,730 guests while keeping her intimate vibe [Image of Enchantment of the Seas pool deck with suspension bridges: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Enchantment_of_the_Seas_in_St._Thomas.jpg].
