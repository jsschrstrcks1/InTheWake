Growden Park was named for James \"Jim\" Growden, a local Fairbanksan who died when Valdez Harbor collapsed in the aftermath of the 1964 Alaska earthquake.  The park is one of the original Fairbanks city parks which was transferred to the Fairbanks North Star Borough when they acquired parks and recreation powers.  I believe the Goldpanners also bill it as the oldest lighted park in Alaska.",
