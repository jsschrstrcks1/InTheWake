        <h1>Dravuni Island: Where Fiji Still Lives Simply</h1>

        <aside class="card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent, #c69); background: #fefcfd; padding: 1rem 1.25rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.6;">
          <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>A note from the author:</strong> Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake — gathered from charts I trust, checked against the wisdom of those who've dropped anchor here before me. I'll update this logbook once I've walked these shores and tested these waters firsthand.</p>
        </aside>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>There are places tourism hasn't ruined yet, small pockets where life moves at the rhythm of tides and tradition instead of cruise schedules. Dravuni Island is one of them. As our tender approached the coral sand beach, I counted maybe thirty thatched bures dotting the volcanic hillside — no roads, no shops, no electricity poles marching toward progress. Just a village of roughly one hundred souls living as their ancestors did, greeting a ship full of strangers with song and genuine smiles that made me question every cynical thought I'd ever had about "authentic cultural experiences."</p>

          <p>The kava ceremony began before we'd stepped off the beach. Village elders sat cross-legged in the shade of a massive banyan tree, preparing yaqona the traditional way — pounding the root, mixing it with water in a tanoa bowl so old it looked carved from sacred wood. This wasn't a show staged for tourists. This was Tuesday morning in Dravuni, the way they welcome anyone entering their village. When the chief offered me the bilo (coconut shell cup), I followed protocol: clap once, say "bula," drink it all, clap three times. It tasted like earthy water strained through roots, slightly numbing my lips. Everyone smiled. I was family now.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Changed Everything:</strong> Sitting on woven mats with a grandmother named Mere who spoke limited English but universal kindness. She showed me how to weave palm fronds into baskets, laughing when my fingers fumbled the pattern she'd known since childhood. Her great-grandchildren played at our feet, unbothered by cameras or schedules. When it was time to leave, she pressed a small woven fish into my hand — a gift I didn't earn, given simply because I sat with her. I carry it in my travel bag still, a reminder that generosity doesn't need a common language.
          </div>

          <p>Dravuni is small enough you can walk the island's perimeter in thirty minutes, steep enough that the climb to the cross atop the volcanic cone takes your breath (and rewards it with 360-degree views of the Kadavu Group). The beach wraps around the northern shore like a white-sand embrace, the water shifting through every shade of blue and green as depth and coral formations change. Snorkeling gear turned the shallows into an aquarium — parrotfish, angelfish, the occasional sea turtle gliding past like they owned the reef (they do). The coral isn't pristine — climate change doesn't spare small islands — but it's alive and worth your time.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you tender ashore.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> No terminal — ships anchor offshore; tenders land directly on coral sand beach</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Kadavu Group, Fiji (18.7667°S, 178.5333°E) — remote island south of Viti Levu</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Yes — tender to beach (5-10 minutes); tenders board/disembark in shallow water; wade ashore</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Fijian Dollar (FJD) — limited use on island; small cash for handicraft purchases; no ATMs</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Fijian; some English spoken by guides and younger villagers</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> No roads, no cars, no shops — village life only; bring what you need from ship</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> May–October (dry season); warm water year-round; January-March cyclone season</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Kava Ceremony Welcome</h4>
          <p>The island's signature experience — traditional yaqona ceremony performed by village elders under the banyan tree. Not a tourist show but genuine Fijian welcome ritual. Chief explains customs, shares island history, invites participation. Clap once, say "bula," drink the earthy kava, clap three times. The ceremony connects you to centuries of Pacific Island hospitality. Respectful participation essential. Brings sevusevu (small gift) if able — packaged food, school supplies, or kava root appreciated. 20-30 minutes. Unforgettable cultural exchange.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Village Tour & Cultural Interactions</h4>
          <p>Walk through village with local guides who share daily life — cooking demonstrations using earth ovens, weaving palm fronds into baskets and mats, traditional fishing techniques, medicinal plants. Visit the village church (Methodist — remove shoes, modest dress required). Children often perform songs or dances. No staged performances — genuine glimpses into island subsistence living. Villagers extraordinarily friendly; expect invitations to ask questions or try weaving. Bring camera but ask permission before photographing people. 1-2 hours of heartfelt exchanges.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Beach Time & Swimming</h4>
          <p>Pristine white coral sand beach wraps northern shoreline. Water bathwater-warm, crystal clear, shallow for 50+ meters. Perfect for wading, swimming, floating. Shade limited (bring hat/sunscreen) but palm trees offer some respite. No beach chairs or amenities — pure natural setting. Collect shells (common, not protected species). Walk barefoot. Let the Pacific work its therapy. 1-2 hours of pure relaxation. Reef shoes helpful for rocky areas.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Snorkeling the Coral Reef</h4>
          <p>Healthy coral formations lie just offshore along northern beach. Snorkel from shore (no boat needed) — swim out 30-50 meters to reef drop-offs. Tropical fish abundant: parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, occasional turtles. Visibility typically excellent. Coral recovering from bleaching events but still colorful and alive. Bring your own gear or rent from ship excursions. Water calm most days. Reef-safe sunscreen essential. 30-60 minutes depending on comfort level. Best snorkeling mid-morning.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hike to the Summit Cross</h4>
          <p>Short but steep trail climbs to white cross atop volcanic cone — panoramic views of Kadavu Group islands, turquoise lagoons, surrounding reefs. Trail informal (follow path, watch footing). 15-20 minute climb. Elevation gain moderate but tropical heat makes it challenging. Reward: 360-degree views worth every breathless step. Bring water. Wear closed-toe shoes (rocky, roots). Sunrise or late afternoon best for photography and cooler temperatures. Not suitable for limited mobility.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Handicraft Shopping</h4>
          <p>Village women sell handwoven baskets, mats, fans, and shell jewelry displayed on blankets near tender landing. Modest prices (5-30 FJD / $2-13 USD) support families directly. Quality varies but charm universal. Woven palm fish, tapa cloth samples, necklaces made from local shells. Bring small Fijian bills or USD. Bargaining not expected but negotiation acceptable. Purchases directly benefit villagers (no middlemen). Allow 15-30 minutes browsing. Perfect authentic souvenirs with stories attached.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> The only option. Island tiny — village and beach within 5-minute walk from tender landing. Summit trail 15-20 minutes uphill. Entire island perimeter walkable in 30 minutes. Bring water and sun protection.</li>
            <li><strong>No Vehicles:</strong> Zero cars, bikes, or motorized transport on island. Village paths dirt/sand. Wear comfortable walking shoes or sandals. Reef shoes useful for rocky beach areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Guided Tours:</strong> Most cruise lines include guided village tours as part of port experience. Local villagers lead groups, explain culture and traditions. Independent exploration also welcome with respectful behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Village occupies hillside above beach. Tender lands on northern shore. Church visible near village center. White cross atop volcanic peak (island's highest point). Simple layout — impossible to get lost.</li>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Kava (Yaqona):</strong> Traditional ceremonial drink made from pounded kava root and water. Mild sedative properties, earthy taste, slightly numbing. Central to Fijian culture. Try it during welcome ceremony — cultural immersion worth the unusual flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Coconuts:</strong> Villagers sometimes offer fresh coconuts hacked open with machetes. Sweet water, soft meat. Natural hydration and authentic island experience. Small cash donation appreciated (5 FJD / $2).</li>
            <li><strong>Tropical Fruit:</strong> Papaya, bananas, pineapple grown on island. Occasionally offered as part of cultural presentations or available for small purchase. Incredibly fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>No Restaurants:</strong> Dravuni has no commercial food services. Ship is your meal source. Some tours include beach picnics organized by cruise line. Bring water from ship — staying hydrated essential in tropical heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional Foods (Demonstrations):</strong> Villagers may demonstrate earth oven (lovo) cooking using banana leaves, coconut cream, and root vegetables. Occasionally tastings offered. Palusami (taro leaves with coconut) and cassava common staples.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tender lands in shallow water — you'll wade ashore. Wear sandals or water shoes you can easily remove. Shorts or swimsuit bottoms save dealing with wet pants. Small waterproof bag protects phone/camera during landing.</li>
            <li>Bring sevusevu (gift) if possible — school supplies (pens, notebooks), packaged non-perishable food, or kava root (purchase in Suva or Lautoka). Not required but deeply appreciated and culturally appropriate. Present to chief or elders during ceremony.</li>
            <li>Dress modestly — shoulders and knees covered when touring village or entering church. Swimsuits fine for beach but bring sarong or light coverup for village areas. Remove shoes before entering church, homes, or when sitting for kava ceremony.</li>
            <li>The kava ceremony is sacred. Participate respectfully: sit cross-legged (or as comfortable), don't refuse the bilo when offered (very insulting), follow clapping protocol (once before, three times after), say "bula." Don't photograph ceremony without permission.</li>
            <li>Bring reef-safe sunscreen — Fiji's reefs are fragile. Shade minimal on beach and trails. Hat and sunglasses essential. Tropical sun intense even on cloudy days. Reapply sunscreen frequently.</li>
            <li>Cash for handicrafts should be small bills — Fijian dollars preferred but USD accepted. Villagers rarely have change for large bills. Purchases directly support families (no tour operator cuts). Fair prices already low; don't over-negotiate.</li>
            <li>No electricity means no ATMs, no credit cards, no WiFi. Disconnect genuinely. Leave valuables on ship. Bring just small cash, phone/camera, water, sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Ask permission before photographing people, especially elders and children. Most villagers friendly and agreeable but respect is paramount. Portraits make wonderful memories when permission granted with smiles.</li>
            <li>Snorkel gear: bring your own if you have it (guaranteed fit) or arrange rental through ship excursion. Village has no equipment rentals. Reef shoes protect feet on coral/rock.</li>
            <li>Tender operations weather-dependent. Swells can delay or cancel landings. Ship crew will announce any changes. Always return to tender with buffer time before all-aboard.</li>
            <li>Slow down. Dravuni operates on island time. Rushing misses the point. Sit with villagers, ask questions, listen to stories. The human connections are the real souvenirs.</li>
            <li>Children may ask for candy or money. Consider bringing small gifts (stickers, pencils, small toys) to share appropriately. Giving directly to children sometimes discouraged; ask guides or offer to village elders for distribution.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where is Dravuni Island and how do cruise ships access it?</strong><br/>A: Dravuni is a small volcanic island in Fiji's Kadavu Group (18.7667°S, 178.5333°E). Ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to the beach — no dock. Tender ride 5-10 minutes, landing in shallow water requiring wading ashore.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What is the kava ceremony and what should I expect?</strong><br/>A: Kava ceremony (yaqona) is Fiji's sacred welcoming ritual. Elders prepare drink from pounded root and water. When offered the bowl, clap once, say "bula," drink it all in one gulp, clap three times. Tastes earthy and slightly numbing. Participating honors tradition and welcomes you into village community.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I explore the village independently or need a guide?</strong><br/>A: Both options work. Most cruise lines organize guided tours but independent respectful exploration welcomed. Remove shoes before entering homes/church. Dress modestly (shoulders/knees covered). Small gifts appreciated (school supplies, packaged food). Villagers extraordinarily friendly.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is the snorkeling good at Dravuni Island?</strong><br/>A: Yes — excellent for small island. Coral reefs just offshore from beach with clear visibility. Colorful reef fish, occasional turtles, healthy coral. Bring own snorkel gear or rent from ship. Warm water year-round. Reef shoes recommended. Best along northern beach.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How much time should I plan for Dravuni?</strong><br/>A: Most cruise visits allow 2-4 hours — enough for kava ceremony, village walk, beach time, and snorkeling. Island tiny (30-minute perimeter walk). Half-day experience focused on cultural exchange and natural beauty, not shopping or activities. Embrace island time.</p>
