  "description": "As we were crossing the Lamire Channel in Antarctica, these orcas appeared from nowhere and I was lucky to be on the front of the boat too. photograph them. The orcas are the top of the food chain, and kill even humpback whales. The elephant seals can dive deeper than the orcas so they are safe.",
