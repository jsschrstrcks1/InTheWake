        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stood at the rail as our ship approached Gibraltar in the predawn darkness, the smell of salt and diesel drifting up from the harbor, and watched the Rock emerge from the night like something conjured from mythology. At 1,400 feet it rises sheer from the Mediterranean, a pale limestone sentinel that has guarded the gateway between two continents for countless millennia. The ancient Greeks called it one of the Pillars of Hercules—they believed the hero had torn apart the mountains to create the Strait, letting the Mediterranean flood through. The sound of the ship's horn echoed off the cliffs as we slowed to dock, and I felt suddenly small beneath that ancient stone.</p>

            <p>Stepping ashore felt like walking into a delightful contradiction. Red British telephone boxes stand next to tapas bars. Fish and chips wafts from pubs while Spanish chatter fills the air. This has been British territory since 1704, when Anglo-Dutch forces seized the Rock during the War of Spanish Succession—over three centuries of Union Jacks flying at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. However, the history here reaches far deeper than colonial disputes. Neanderthals lived in these caves 40,000 years ago, leaving bones and tools that archaeologists still study. The Phoenicians sailed through this strait seeking tin and silver. Romans, Moors, and Spanish all claimed these waters before Britain planted her flag.</p>

            <p>I took the cable car up the Rock with pilgrims from a dozen nations. The ascent takes six minutes, and halfway through we entered a cloud—the famous "Levanter" that caps the summit when east winds blow across the Mediterranean. I heard nothing but the hum of the cable and the quiet murmur of passengers. Then suddenly we emerged above the mist, Africa shimmering across the Strait just fifteen kilometers distant, so close I could see the Rif Mountains catching the morning light. Morocco seemed close enough to touch. Two continents visible in a single glance. I had never stood anywhere that felt so precisely positioned between worlds.</p>

            <p>The Barbary macaques found me before I found them. These are Europe's only wild primates, brought here perhaps by the Moors after 711 AD, though no one knows for certain. A bold male leaped onto my shoulder before I could react, his hands surprisingly warm as he investigated my collar for anything interesting. Legend says Britain will hold Gibraltar only as long as the apes remain—when their numbers dwindled during World War II, Winston Churchill himself ordered reinforcements brought from Morocco. They are charming thieves who can work a zipper faster than you can stop them, utterly unimpressed by tourists, protected by law and local affection.</p>

            <p>St. Michael's Cave stopped my breath entirely. The Greeks believed this cavern descended into Hades itself—the gates to the underworld hidden 300 meters above the sea. I walked into the main chamber and understood their awe. Stalactites hung like frozen waterfalls from vaulted ceilings. Stalagmites rose to meet them in columns millions of years in the making. The cave now serves as an auditorium seating 400, where concerts and ballets play beneath formations older than human memory. Standing there in the colored lights, surrounded by stone shaped by water drop by patient drop across epochs, I felt my heart swell with gratitude for this unexpected gift. Tears pricked my eyes at the vastness of geological time, at beauty so ancient it made my life seem a flicker of candlelight.</p>

            <p>The WWII tunnels brought me back to human scale—narrow passages blasted through the Rock by British engineers who transformed Gibraltar into an impregnable fortress. Miles of tunnels honeycomb the limestone: ammunition stores, barracks, a hospital, a telephone exchange. During the war, 30,000 soldiers lived inside this mountain. The air was cool and damp, footsteps echoing off walls that witnessed preparations for operations that would shape the modern world. In 1942, while expanding the tunnel network, workers accidentally broke through into a previously unknown cave system below St. Michael's—geology revealing her secrets even as war raged above.</p>

            <p>I walked down through the Mediterranean Steps, 1,400 feet of descent through scrub and sunshine, past gun emplacements and observation posts where sentries once watched for Spanish or French sails. The views from Europa Point at the southern tip span both continents and both seas—the Mediterranean to the east, the Atlantic beyond to the west. Cargo ships sliding through the Strait looked patient as pilgrims. The Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque gleamed white in the afternoon light, a gift from Saudi Arabia's king, standing near the lighthouse that has guided mariners since the 19th century.</p>

            <p>Before returning to the ship, I sat at a pub on Casemates Square eating fish and chips that could have come from any seaside town in England, listening to locals switch effortlessly between English and Spanish, watching the Rock turn golden in the setting sun. I thought about all the sailors who had passed this point through history, all the empires that had fought for this stone, all the travelers who had stood exactly where I stood, feeling the same smallness and wonder. This is what I learned in Gibraltar: that some places exist as hinges of history, as boundary markers between worlds, as proof that geography shapes destiny. I felt blessed to have walked where Hercules once stood, privileged to have glimpsed two continents from a single stone.</p>

        <!-- Cruise Port Section -->

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Gibraltar's cruise terminal sits at the western end of the harbor, a straightforward 10-minute walk from Casemates Square and Main Street. This is one of the easiest cruise ports in the Mediterranean—walk off the ship, through a simple terminal building, and you're essentially in town. No shuttles required, no long walks, no confusion about where to go.</p>

            <p>The terminal itself is functional rather than fancy, with basic facilities, ATMs, and a tourist information desk. Currency is British pounds, though euros are accepted nearly everywhere (often at unfavorable rates—withdraw pounds from ATMs for best value). English is the primary language, though you'll hear plenty of Spanish—Spain is literally across the runway. Gibraltar uses British electrical outlets. Mobile phones from most countries work here; UK roaming rules apply for British visitors.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate to high.</strong> Gibraltar rewards those willing to climb. The cable car eliminates the steepest ascent to the Upper Rock, but getting around still involves walking on varied terrain. St. Michael's Cave requires navigating stairs and uneven surfaces. The Mediterranean Steps descent is strenuous (though spectacular). Main Street and Casemates Square are flat and accessible. Wheelchair users will find the lower town manageable but the Upper Rock challenging—some taxi drivers offer accessible vehicle tours. Budget 5-7 hours for a thorough exploration.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> Walking is the primary way to experience Gibraltar. From the cruise terminal to Casemates Square: 10 minutes. To the cable car station: 20 minutes. Along Main Street: another 15 minutes. The lower town is compact and easily walkable, though hilly in places. Comfortable shoes essential—cobblestones and stairs abound.</p>

            <p><strong>Cable car:</strong> The Gibraltar Cable Car (£16 round-trip, £12 one-way) runs from the lower station near Casemates Square to the Top of the Rock, covering 412 meters of elevation in 6 minutes. Lines can be long when multiple cruise ships are in port—arrive early or late afternoon for shorter waits. The round-trip ticket includes access to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, St. Michael's Cave, the Great Siege Tunnels, and the Apes' Den. <strong>Book ahead</strong> online for a small discount and potential queue-jumping.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxi tours:</strong> Many visitors hire taxi drivers for comprehensive Upper Rock tours (£25-35 per person for 90-minute circuits). Drivers know where to find the macaques, which viewpoints offer the best photography, and how to maximize limited time. Negotiate price and itinerary before departing. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, confirm timing expectations clearly.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> to Gibraltar typically include cable car, St. Michael's Cave, and macaque encounters for $70-120 per person. They're convenient but pricey—going <strong>independent</strong> saves roughly half and allows more flexibility. However, for those with mobility concerns or time anxiety, ship tours guarantee you won't be left behind. Shore excursion buses can also cross into Spain for day trips to Seville or Ronda (£100-150).</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The lower town around Main Street and Casemates Square is generally accessible, though some historic areas have steps and narrow passages. The cable car can accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice—call ahead to arrange. The Upper Rock presents significant challenges for mobility devices. Several taxi operators offer accessible vehicles for Rock tours; arrange through the tourist office.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Gibraltar concentrates its wonders into a remarkably compact space. Most visitors can see the highlights independently with careful planning. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> offer convenience; going <strong>independent</strong> saves money and allows more personal pacing. The essential experience—cable car, Upper Rock, St. Michael's Cave, macaques—takes 3-4 hours regardless of how you organize it.</p>

            <h3>The Upper Rock Nature Reserve</h3>
            <p>This is the must-do experience in Gibraltar. The Nature Reserve (£13 entry, or included with cable car ticket) encompasses the upper slopes of the Rock, home to the Barbary macaques, St. Michael's Cave, the Great Siege Tunnels, and the Moorish Castle. You can spend an entire day here exploring, though most cruise visitors allow 3-4 hours. Start with the cable car to the summit, then work your way down through the various attractions. The views alone justify the visit—two continents, two seas, and the shipping lanes of one of the world's busiest waterways spreading below.</p>

            <h3>St. Michael's Cave</h3>
            <p>The cave that the ancient Greeks believed led to Hades remains Gibraltar's most atmospheric attraction. Entry is included with Nature Reserve admission. The main chamber has been converted into an auditorium—stalactites and stalagmites surrounding concert seating for 400. Beyond the main cave, New St. Michael's Cave (discovered in 1942) offers more adventurous exploration for £20 via guided tours that include rappelling and crawling through tighter passages. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for adventure tours—they fill quickly and require advance reservation.</p>

            <h3>WWII Tunnels & Great Siege Tunnels</h3>
            <p>Gibraltar is honeycombed with tunnels—over 30 miles of passages carved through limestone. The Great Siege Tunnels date from 1779-1783, when British defenders carved gun emplacements to repel Spanish and French attackers. The WWII tunnels expanded this network dramatically, creating barracks, hospitals, and command centers inside the Rock. Both are included with Nature Reserve admission. Budget 45-60 minutes for a thorough exploration. The temperature drops noticeably inside—bring a layer.</p>

            <h3>Europa Point</h3>
            <p>The southernmost point of Gibraltar offers Africa views, the Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque, Trinity Lighthouse, and a contemplative atmosphere far from the tourist bustle. Accessible by bus (£2.20) or taxi (£10-15). Worth visiting if you have 4+ hours ashore. The Mosque is one of the largest in a non-Muslim country, a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia—respectful visitors can view the exterior and grounds.</p>

            <h3>Main Street Shopping</h3>
            <p>Gibraltar is duty-free, drawing shoppers for electronics, jewelry, perfume, alcohol, and tobacco. Main Street concentrates most retail options, with prices that can beat UK and European shops—though comparison shopping is wise. British brands are particularly well-priced. Budget 1-2 hours for serious browsing.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->
        <details class="port-section depth-soundings" open>
          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> British pounds (GBP) are official currency. ATMs dispense pounds at standard international fees (typically €3-5 per withdrawal). Euros accepted widely but at poor exchange rates (typically 1:1 when the actual rate is closer to €1.15 per pound). Credit cards accepted nearly everywhere with typical €2-3 foreign transaction fees.</p>

            <p><strong>The Macaques:</strong> Europe's only wild primates are clever, bold, and legally protected. Never feed them (£4,000 fine). Keep bags zipped and cameras secured—they can and will grab anything shiny or interesting. If one jumps on you, stay calm; they'll leave when bored. Best viewing at the Apes' Den near the cable car summit station.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather & Levanter:</strong> The "Levanter" cloud forms when east winds push moist air up the Rock's face, creating dramatic mist caps. If you see clear skies upon arrival, head up immediately—conditions can change within hours. The Levanter obscures summit views but adds atmospheric drama to the experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Border Crossing:</strong> Gibraltar shares a land border with Spain. Walking into La Línea takes 15-20 minutes from the cruise terminal—you'll cross the airport runway (seriously). EU/UK passport holders can cross freely; others should check visa requirements. The crossing is straightforward but can have queues during busy periods.</p>

            <p><strong>Dining:</strong> Fish and chips dominate (€10-18), but Gibraltar also offers Spanish tapas (€5-12 per plate), Indian curry, and international options. Casemates Square has the highest concentration of restaurants. Try the Rock Hotel's afternoon tea (€30) for colonial atmosphere. Local specialties include calentita (chickpea flour bread, €3) and rolitos (meat-stuffed pastries, €4).</p>

            <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Gibraltar is a tender port for some ships—check your cruise documents. Cable car lines peak 10:00-14:00 when multiple ships are in port. Early morning (right at 9:30 opening) or late afternoon offers shorter waits. The Nature Reserve closes at 19:15 in summer, 18:15 in winter.</p>

        <details class="port-section faq" open>
          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>Q: Is Gibraltar worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br />
            A: Absolutely. Where else can you stand on British territory, see two continents at once, visit caves the ancient Greeks believed led to Hades, and get photobombed by Europe's only wild apes—all within a few hours? The combination of history, nature, and surreal cultural mixing makes Gibraltar genuinely unique.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Should I book the cable car in advance?</strong><br />
            A: <strong>Book ahead</strong> online if you want to save a few pounds and potentially skip some queue time. However, walk-up tickets are always available. The real issue is the wait—arrive early or late to avoid midday crowds.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need on the Rock?</strong><br />
            A: Allow 3-4 hours for the essential experience: cable car up, St. Michael's Cave, macaque encounters, Great Siege Tunnels, cable car down. Add another 1-2 hours for Europa Point, Main Street shopping, or the Mediterranean Steps descent. Most cruise calls provide 6-8 hours, which is comfortable.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Are the monkeys dangerous?</strong><br />
            A: The Barbary macaques are not aggressive but they are bold. They've learned that tourists carry interesting things. Keep bags zipped, don't wave food around, and stay calm if one approaches. They're looking for opportunities, not confrontation. Never feed them—it's illegal and makes them more aggressive over time.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I cross into Spain?</strong><br />
            A: Yes. The border with Spain is open and walking across takes 15-20 minutes from the cruise terminal. You'll cross the airport runway on foot (Gibraltar's runway bisects the main road). EU and UK passport holders cross freely; others should verify visa requirements. La Línea, the Spanish town at the border, offers cheaper restaurants and more Spanish atmosphere.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br />
            A: British pounds work best. Euros are accepted but typically at a poor 1:1 rate when the actual exchange is closer to 1:1.15. ATMs are plentiful and dispense pounds. Credit cards work nearly everywhere.</p>
