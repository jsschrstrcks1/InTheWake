        <h1>Charleston: The Holy City's Gateway to the Caribbean</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Charleston is perhaps America's most beautiful port city. Sailing from here means departing through the same harbor where the Civil War began — where Fort Sumter's walls still bear the scars of that first bombardment, where centuries of history line cobblestone streets shaded by live oaks and Spanish moss. The Union Pier Terminal sits at the edge of the historic district, close enough that you can walk to Rainbow Row's pastel antebellum homes before your ship even finishes loading.</p>

          <p>Known as the "Holy City" for its skyline of church steeples and tradition of religious tolerance, Charleston consistently ranks among America's top cities. The architecture, the food, the hospitality — everything here moves at a gentler pace, with a grace that feels almost European. Sailing away as the sun sets over the Cooper River, with Fort Sumter silhouetted against the fading light, is one of cruising's most memorable departures.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>Logbook Note:</strong> Arriving a day early isn't optional here — it's essential. Walk the Battery at sunset, tour a plantation, eat shrimp and grits at a waterfront table, and let Charleston's centuries of hospitality wash over you. This city has been welcoming travelers since 1670; give it the time it deserves.

          <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
          <p>Charleston was founded in 1670 as Charles Town, named for King Charles II, making it one of America's oldest cities. Its deep harbor made it the wealthiest city in colonial America — built on rice, indigo, and unfortunately, the labor of enslaved Africans who passed through Sullivan's Island, sometimes called "the Ellis Island of Black America." That complex history is woven into every cobblestone and church spire.</p>
          <p>The city survived British occupation during the Revolution, devastating fires, a massive earthquake in 1886, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 — each time rebuilding with the resilience that defines Charleston character. Today's visitors walk streets where George Washington lodged, where Edgar Allan Poe served at Fort Moultrie, and where the opening shots of the Civil War echoed across the harbor. Charleston doesn't just preserve its history — it lives it, in the architecture, the traditions, and the warm welcome extended to every traveler who arrives at its shores.</p>

            <li><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Charleston is elegant but not stuffy — smart casual works everywhere; sundresses and seersucker fit right in</li>
            <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Book dinner reservations at popular restaurants well in advance, especially weekends</li>
            <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> Horse carriage and pedicab drivers expect 15-20% gratuity</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Wear comfortable shoes — cobblestones and brick sidewalks are charming but uneven</li>
