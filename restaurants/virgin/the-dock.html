      <h3>The Dock Review: Sunset Cocktails in the Best Seat on the Ship</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Dock (and its enclosed counterpart, The Dock House) is an outdoor cocktail lounge situated at the aft of the ship — offering sweeping ocean views, comfortable lounge seating, and what is widely considered the best sunset-watching spot on any Virgin Voyages vessel. By day, it is a relaxed alternative to the pool bars; by evening, it transforms into a sophisticated pre-dinner cocktail destination. The food menu features Mediterranean-inspired small plates. Everything is included in the fare (food) or Bar Tab (drinks).</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The cocktail program here is a step above the pool bars — the bartenders have more time and the menu is more thoughtful. The "Dock-tail" (a gin-based drink with cucumber, elderflower, and soda) is the signature and it is light, refreshing, and perfectly suited to the outdoor setting. The aperol spritz is well-made and the most popular order at sunset. The rose selection is strong — three or four options by the glass, all quality. The small plates are Mediterranean-leaning: the hummus with warm pita is good, the grilled halloumi is salty and satisfying, and the mezze platter is a solid sharing option. Where it falls short: the food menu is limited to small plates and light bites — this is not a dinner destination. The cocktails, while better than the pool bars, still do not reach the craft level of Sip. The espresso martini made here is average. Premium wine carries surcharges.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Table service from servers who circulate through the lounge seating — you do not need to go to the bar. The pace is relaxed and attentive, and the servers are good at anticipating refills. The Dock House (indoor section) has a slightly more structured service experience. Staff are friendly and conversational. The service level sits comfortably between the high-volume pool bars and the premium experience of Richard's Rooftop.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>This is The Dock's greatest strength. The aft location means unobstructed wake views, open sky, and some of the best sunset vantage points on the ship. The design is relaxed-nautical with rope accents, wooden decking, and comfortable cushioned seating. The music is mellow — acoustic, lounge, or ambient — and at a volume that allows conversation. In the evening, the lighting shifts to warm amber and the vibe becomes genuinely romantic. Where it falls short: the space fills up fast at sunset — arriving by 5:30 PM is essential to claim good seats. Wind can be an issue at the aft position, especially on faster sailing days. The Dock House (indoor) lacks the views that make the outdoor section special. On port days when the ship is docked, the aft view is of a port rather than the ocean.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.0/5.</strong> The Dock is one of the best bars on Virgin Voyages — the sunset views are stunning, the cocktails are well-made, and the atmosphere balances sophistication with relaxation beautifully. It falls short on food depth (small plates only), cocktail craft level (good but not exceptional), and the challenge of securing good seating during golden hour. <em>Tip:</em> claim a lounge seat by 5:30 PM on sea days for sunset, order the aperol spritz, and stay through the lighting transition — it is one of the most beautiful moments of the voyage.</p>
