  "description": "The Old Shipping Office is a beautifully restored building, built in 1895. Full restoration and strengthening completed December 2011. It is listed with the Historic Places Trust and the Akaroa Civic Trust. It is fully self contained with kitchen facilities and serviced daily. Cosy gas fire and double spa bath. Very romantic and perfect for those special occasions. A unique place to stay right in the heart of Akaroa. View of the Akaroa Harbour from the lounge.\nThe Old Shipping Office was nominated for the 2012 Canterbury Heritage Awards, and subsequently won a Highly Commended in the Heritage Restoration category. It is a real achievement especially in light of the calibre of the other entrants",
