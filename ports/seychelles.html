        <h1>Seychelles: Where Eden Still Exists</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The Seychelles doesn't look real. Approaching Mahé by ship, I kept waiting for someone to admit the whole archipelago was a digital rendering — those massive granite boulders tumbling into water that precise shade of turquoise, palm trees bending at angles that shouldn't be structurally sound, beaches so white they hurt to look at. But it's real. All 115 islands scattered across the western Indian Ocean, 1,000 miles from anywhere, preserving what the rest of the world lost when we paved paradise and put up parking lots.</p>

          <p>Victoria is the world's smallest capital city, and it knows it. You can walk the entire downtown in twenty minutes. There's a miniature Big Ben clock tower (locals call it "Little Ben") that the British left behind, a vivid Hindu temple painted in yellows and reds that reminds you this is where Africa meets Asia, and a market where vendors sell breadfruit, coconuts the size of bowling balls, and fish I couldn't name. The charm is in the scale — this is a capital city where the president probably knows your grandmother.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Feeding lettuce to a 150-year-old giant tortoise at the Botanical Gardens. His name was George (probably). He moved with the unhurried confidence of something that's lived through two world wars and countless hurricanes and isn't particularly impressed by either. A small girl placed a leaf on his shell, and he turned his ancient head to regard her with what I swear was patient amusement. Time works differently for tortoises. Maybe for islands too.
          </div>

          <p>If you only see one beach, make it Beau Vallon. Fifteen minutes north of Victoria, it delivers the full Seychelles experience — powder sand that squeaks underfoot, water warm as bathwater, granite formations rising from the shallows like sculpture. But here's the secret: Mahé has 68 beaches. Sixty-eight. Each one seems more beautiful than the last, as if the island is showing off.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Beau Vallon Beach</h4>
          <p>Mahé's most famous beach — 3 km of white sand, calm turquoise water, granite boulders, and swaying palms. Beach restaurants, water sports, snorkeling. 15 minutes from port by taxi (~300 SCR / $20). Swim safe zones marked. Wednesday night market features grilled fish and local crafts. Half-day minimum.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Seychelles National Botanical Gardens</h4>
          <p>Giant Aldabra tortoises, endemic palms including the famous coco de mer (largest seed in the world), fruit bat colonies, and hundreds of tropical species. 10 minutes from port. ~100 SCR ($7) entry. Cool morning walk, allow 1-2 hours. The tortoises are ancient, patient, and utterly charming.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Victoria Market & Little Ben</h4>
          <p>Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market — vibrant local market selling fish, produce, spices, and souvenirs. Experience authentic Seychellois life. Free. Adjacent to Little Ben clock tower (1903), Victoria's most photographed landmark. Easy walking from port. 1-2 hours browsing.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sainte Anne Marine National Park</h4>
          <p>Snorkeling and glass-bottom boat trips to protected waters surrounding six islands. Sea turtles, tropical fish, coral gardens. Half-day tours from ~€70-100 including equipment. Book through port or hotel. Marine life is spectacular — this is what reefs should look like everywhere.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Morne Seychellois National Park</h4>
          <p>Mountain rainforest covering 20% of Mahé. Hiking trails through endemic flora, mountain vistas, cloud forest. Mission Lodge viewpoint offers panoramic views where Queen Elizabeth II took tea in 1972. Requires taxi + hiking. Half-day for viewpoints, full-day for serious hiking.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Arul Mihu Navasakthi Vinayagar Temple</h4>
          <p>Colorful Hindu temple in Victoria — ornate gopuram tower, intricate sculptures, vibrant colors. Reflects Seychelles' multicultural heritage (African, Asian, European influences). Free (donations welcome). Respectful dress required. 20-minute visit adds cultural dimension.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Victoria downtown is compact and walkable from port (15-20 min). Sidewalks decent in town, limited elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port; negotiate fare before departure. Expect ~300 SCR ($20) to Beau Vallon. No meters — agree on price first.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but expensive (~€50-70/day). Roads mountainous, narrow, winding. Traffic drives on left. International license required.</li>
            <li><strong>Bus:</strong> Local SPTC buses cheap (~7 SCR) but infrequent and crowded. Route 22 goes to Beau Vallon. For cruise day, taxis more practical.</li>
            <li><strong>Bike Rental:</strong> Popular option for fit travelers (~€15/day). Hilly terrain but scenically rewarding.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grilled Fish:</strong> Red snapper, tuna, bourgeois (parrotfish) — fresh from the ocean, grilled with Creole spices. Beach restaurants specialize.</li>
            <li><strong>Octopus Curry:</strong> Seychellois staple — tender octopus in rich coconut curry sauce. Served with rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Ladob:</strong> Sweet dessert of plantains or breadfruit cooked in coconut milk with nutmeg and vanilla. Comfort food.</li>
            <li><strong>Shark Chutney:</strong> Unique Seychellois dish — boiled shark meat with lime (bilimbi fruit), turmeric. Acquired taste but culturally significant.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Tropical Fruit:</strong> Breadfruit, papaya, passion fruit, star fruit, jackfruit — absurdly fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li><strong>Seybrew &amp; Takamaka Rum:</strong> Local beer (light lager) and coconut rum. Takamaka Bay distillery makes excellent aged rums.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring reef-safe sunscreen — Seychelles protects its marine ecosystems. Chemical sunscreens banned in marine parks.</li>
            <li>US Dollars and Euros accepted widely but change given in Rupees. ATMs available but bring cash for markets/taxis.</li>
            <li>Mahé has 68 beaches — if Beau Vallon is crowded, ask taxi driver for quieter alternatives like Anse Royale or Anse Intendance.</li>
            <li>Wednesday market at Beau Vallon (evening) features grilled fish, live music, crafts. If your ship stays late, don't miss it.</li>
            <li>Giant tortoises are ancient and gentle — don't climb on them, but feeding lettuce is encouraged at Botanical Gardens.</li>
            <li>Weather changes quickly — carry light rain jacket. Tropical showers pass fast but soak thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Snorkeling gear rental available at beaches (~€10) — marine life visibility excellent year-round.</li>
          </ul>
