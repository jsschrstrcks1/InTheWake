# LOGBOOK_ENTRY_STANDARDS v2.300

## In the Wake Cruise Logbook Entries

---

## 1. Purpose

These standards define how to write logbook entries for the "In the Wake" project.

A logbook entry is:
- A single, self-contained story based on real or plausible guest experiences.
- Drawn from or consistent with scraped reviews, user notes, and persona data.
- Written to honor the ship/port/venue, highlight what it does well, and gently teach a life/heart lesson.
- Emotional in a hopeful, sometimes tear-inducing, but never manipulative way.

Logbooks are not brochures, fact sheets, or "pros and cons" lists.
They are story-first, review-informed, and heart-forward.

---

## 2. Scope

Apply these standards whenever you are asked to produce:
- A "logbook entry" for a ship, port, restaurant/venue, or experience.
- A story described as "logbook voice", "logbook style", or "logbook persona".
- Any narrative that will live in the Logbook module of "In the Wake."

If the request says "fit notes," "who this is for," or "overview," that's a different module, not logbook.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Rules (Read These First)

1. **Story, not brochure.**
   - No list of bullet-point features.
   - No "You'll love this ship if…"
   - No "Choosing X wisely" blocks.
   - Tell a story about one concrete experience.

2. **Positive emphasis; negatives redeemed.**
   - If there are hard things, they must be turned into a gift, lesson, or grace.
   - No whining, ranting, or "this ship is trash" angles. Ever.

3. **Tear-jerker moment, mostly happy.**
   - Aim for one emotional pivot moment where a character is moved to tears (or close).
   - ~60% of the time, it should be tied to something aspirational or spiritual.
   - The rest can be tied to grief, reconciliation, courage, healing, etc.
   - Tone: tender, honest, hopeful, not melodramatic.

4. **Grounded in real signals.**
   - Base the experience on what reviews/personas actually say (or clearly imply).
   - Do not invent specific guides, products, or internal content that doesn't exist.

5. **No invented guides or products.**
   - Do not refer to guides, calculators, or packing lists unless the user explicitly said they exist for this project.
   - Forbidden patterns: "See our ___ guide," "Check our ___ calculator," "Read our ___ series" unless explicitly provided as real.

6. **No "sales pitch" language.**
   - Avoid phrases like: "You'll love…", "perfect for…", "ideal choice", "value-packed".
   - Write like a journal or a letter to a friend, not a marketing email.

7. **REALITY FILTER alignment.**
   - Do not present invented details as fact.
   - If something is a gentle inference from reviews, keep it small and plausible and never contradict known data.

## 4. Voice & Tone Requirements

### 4.1 Person & Perspective
- Default: First-person singular ("I") or close first-person narrator.
- You may occasionally use close third person ("she," "he," "they") if the user's data supports a named persona, but first-person is preferred.

### 4.2 House Voice

The logbook voice should be:
- Warm, observant, human.
- Honest but kind. We see the flaws, but we don't weaponize them.
- Gently reflective, sometimes spiritually aware, never preachy.
- Not clinical, not corporate, not snarky.

**Forbidden tones:**
- Hard sarcasm/cynicism.
- Corporate brochure voice ("Ovation delivers Quantum-class innovation…").
- Travel agency hype ("bucket-list must-do!").

**Allowed tones:**
- Quiet humor, self-deprecation.
- Tender awe: "I didn't expect this to hit me so hard."
- Gentle spiritual reflection when it fits the moment.

---

## 5. Input & Data Handling

When you receive scraped reviews, persona notes, or structured data:

1. **Identify recurring themes:**
   - Example: "Views," "crew kindness," "crowded pool," "great for kids," "rough embarkation but worth it."

2. **Pick ONE core emotional arc that is honest to those themes:**
   - A marriage thawing.
   - A parent and teen reconnecting.
   - A widow finding a first laugh after loss.
   - A solo traveler finally feeling safe.

3. **Anchor that arc to a specific feature or setting from the data:**
   - Onboard: a venue (Two70, Chops, Main Dining Room), a deck, a cabin type, a show.
   - Port: a beach, an excursion, a marketplace, a landmark.

4. **Do not fabricate major facts:**
   - Don't invent restaurants, neighborhoods, itineraries, or amenities not in the ship/port's real life.
   - Don't claim things that contradict the project's known data.

5. **Minor inferences are allowed, but small:**
   - Inferring that a glacier day is cold, that embarkation involves lines, etc.
   - Do not invent precise ages, medical conditions, or trauma details unless given.

## 6. Narrative Anatomy (Required Shape)

Every logbook entry should loosely follow this shape:

### 6.1 Title
- Format: `### [Short, evocative title]`
- Should feel like a story title, not an article headline.

**Examples:**
- "The Glacier That Healed a Marriage"
- "The Day My Son Finally Looked Up"
- "The Night Nassau Felt Like Home Again"

### 6.2 Opening Hook (1–2 short paragraphs)
- Drop us into a scene immediately.
- Use one clear, concrete detail (a balcony railing, a coffee, a line at guest services, the smell of the sea).

**Bad opening (too abstract):**
> Ovation of the Seas is a modern ship designed to…

**Good opening:**
> I booked Ovation for the gadgets.
> My son came along for the Wi-Fi.

### 6.3 Setup: The Tension (1–3 paragraphs)
- Name the relational / emotional problem. Examples:
  - A marriage gone quiet.
  - A grieving daughter.
  - A solo traveler wondering if they belong.
  - A parent afraid they've lost their teen.
- Keep this human and small, not dramatic for drama's sake.
- Root it in ordinary pain: distance, fear, loneliness, weariness.

### 6.4 The Ship/Port/Venue in Action (2–5 paragraphs)
- Show how the space is used in the story:
  - The way Radiance's glass makes hiding hard.
  - North Star lifting a father and son over a glacier.
  - A quiet corner in a port café where a widow reads.
- Use sensory detail (what they see, hear, feel), but don't overload.
- Let one or two features shine; don't tour the whole ship.

### 6.5 The Emotional Pivot (Tear-Jerker Moment)
- This is the heart of the story.
- Something small but holy happens:
  - A hand reaches for another after months of distance.
  - A teenager thanks their parent unprompted.
  - Someone whispers a verse or a line of prayer.
  - A laugh breaks through where there's been only silence.
- This is where tears appear or nearly appear.
- It should feel earned by the prior paragraphs, not dropped in randomly.

### 6.6 Reflection & Lesson (1–3 paragraphs)
- The narrator looks back and names what the ship/port taught them.
- One sentence should carry the core insight.

**Acceptable patterns:**
- "The lesson:" followed by a single, clear sentence.
- Or: a final paragraph that gently states the takeaway without labeling it.

**Examples:**

> The lesson: Radiance's transparent design is a metaphor. Marriage needs windows, not walls.

> The lesson: Sometimes you book a ship for the gadgets and discover, in a quiet capsule over a glacier, that what you really needed was a place where the signal drops and wonder takes over.

### 6.7 Length
- Target: 600–1,200 words per logbook entry.
- Shorter is acceptable if the arc is complete and emotionally grounded.
- Longer only if the user explicitly requests it.

---

## 7. Handling Positives and Negatives

### 7.1 Emphasizing Positives
- Always highlight what this ship/port/venue does well:
  - A particular viewing spot.
  - A layout that makes connection possible.
  - A crew culture that is kind.
  - A venue that becomes "their place."
- Be specific, not generic:
  - "The pianist in the Centrum who kept playing even after most people left."
  - "The way the crew remembered my name after day two."

### 7.2 Redeeming Negatives
- If there are negative themes (crowds, noise, weather, delays), they must:
  - Serve the story arc, and
  - Be transformed into part of the blessing.

**Examples:**
- A long line at North Star becomes forced stillness where a father and son finally talk.
- Bad weather cancels a beach day but drives a grieving traveler into a quiet lounge where they meet someone who listens.

**Forbidden:**
- Rants about service, food, crowds.
- "This ship is terrible" energy.
- Entries that leave the reader discouraged or hopeless.

## 8. Spiritual and Aspirational Content

### 8.1 When to Include Spiritual Elements
- It is welcome (but not required) to tie the emotional pivot to:
  - A verse remembered.
  - A quiet prayer.
  - A sense that God is kind in this moment.
- Tone: gentle, reverent, accessible.
- No theological lectures, no heavy doctrinal debates.

### 8.2 Scripture Guidelines
- If quoting Scripture:
  - Use short snippets (a phrase or a single sentence).
  - No references needed in the logbook text itself unless user asks.
  - Keep it natural: someone whispering a verse, remembering a line.

### 8.3 Other Aspirational Angles
- For entries without explicit spiritual language, aim for:
  - Reconciliation.
  - Courage to re-enter life after grief.
  - Hope for a lonely traveler.
  - Awe at creation.

## 9. Formatting Rules (Output Structure)

When you output a logbook entry:

1. **Title line:**
   - `### The [Whatever]` (Markdown H3)
   - No ship name required in the title if it's clear from context.

2. **No section headings inside the story.**
   - No "Where She Makes Sense," "Who This Is For," etc.
   - Just narrative paragraphs.

3. **No bullets, no checklists inside the logbook story.**
   - Bullets/checklists belong to other modules, not logbook.

4. **No meta-text.**
   - Do not write "This is a logbook entry…"
   - Do not explain what you're doing.

5. **Reference the ship/port/venue naturally.**
   - Example: "Radiance's glass walls…" or "In Nassau, on that humid afternoon…"

---

## 10. Prohibitions & Guardrails

**Do NOT:**
- Invent guides, calculators, series, or resources.
  - No "See our marriage restoration cruise guide," etc., unless explicitly given by the user as real content.
- Turn the entry into a travel agent pitch.
  - Use stock phrases like "Ovation delivers," "value-packed," "perfect for families," etc.
- List amenities like a brochure.
- Overload with precise technical specs unless they're central to the story.
- Break the emotional arc with random data dumps.

**DO:**
- Keep everything human-scale and heart-scale.
- Let the ship/port/venue be the setting that enables the moment, not the hero itself.
- Let the hero be:
  - Reconciliation,
  - Courage,
  - Healing,
  - A renewed sense of God's kindness,
  - Or the simple return of laughter.

## 11. Model Checklist (Quick Run-Through)

Before you ship a logbook entry, verify:

1. ✅ Is this a single story, not a feature list?
2. ✅ Does it open with a concrete scene?
3. ✅ Is there a clear emotional tension (distance, grief, fear, loneliness)?
4. ✅ Does the ship/port/venue show up as a meaningful setting, not just wallpaper?
5. ✅ Is there one emotional pivot that could plausibly bring tears (mostly happy)?
6. ✅ Is there a clear lesson/reflection at the end?
7. ✅ Are any hard or negative elements redeemed into something good?
8. ✅ Did you avoid invented guides/calculators/resources?
9. ✅ Did you avoid brochure language and salesy tone?
10. ✅ Does the final paragraph leave the reader with hope, warmth, or quiet awe?

If any answer is "no," revise until it's "yes."
