          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship into morning light so clean it felt like drinking cold water. The air carried the scent of salt and coffee and something green—that unmistakable Nordic freshness that makes even familiar cities feel mythical. Gothenburg spread before me along its canals and harbor, seagulls crying overhead, the blue and white Swedish flag snapping in the breeze. The temperature was perfect—cool enough for a light jacket, warm enough to feel summer's promise. This is Sweden's second city, but it feels nothing like Stockholm. Where the capital performs grandeur, Gothenburg simply lives its life, welcoming visitors without fanfare, confident in its own quiet appeal.</p>

            <p>The tram carried me into the city center in just ten minutes, rattling over cobblestones past university students on bicycles and pensioners with shopping bags, everyone moving with that unhurried Scandinavian grace. I found Haga first—the old working-class district that somehow survived urban renewal to become the city's most beloved neighborhood. Wooden houses painted in mustard and rust line narrow cobbled streets. The smell of cinnamon from Café Husaren filled the air, the place famous for kanelbullar the size of dinner plates. I sat with coffee and pastry for 85 SEK (€8) and watched the morning unfold through tall windows, feeling time slow to a gentler pace.</p>

            <p>Feskekôrka stopped me in my tracks. The name means "fish church," and the building deserves it—a Gothic-inspired market hall from 1874 where counters overflow with the day's catch from the cold North Sea. I walked between displays of shrimp and oysters and langoustine, past vendors in white aprons filleting salmon with surgical precision, past families debating between monkfish and turbot. The scent was oceanic and utterly fresh—nothing like the fishy smell of less fortunate markets. I bought a paper cone of räksmörgås (shrimp sandwich, 75 SEK) and ate it standing, the butter and dill and sweet shrimp dissolving on my tongue. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected perfection.</p>

            <p>However, it was the archipelago that truly captured me. A ferry from Saltholmen took twenty minutes to reach Styrsö, one of the southern islands, and suddenly the city vanished. Red wooden boathouses lined rocky shores, their paint weathered by decades of salt spray. Narrow paths wound between summer cottages where families had gathered for generations. No cars are permitted—only feet and bicycles move through these islands, the silence broken only by birdsong and distant laughter. I walked for an hour along granite outcrops overlooking the sea, past wild roses and weather-beaten pines bent by prevailing winds, until I found a flat rock warmed by the afternoon sun. I sat there watching sailboats trace white lines across the dark blue water, listening to nothing but wind and waves and the occasional cry of a tern, feeling something tight in my chest finally release. Tears pricked my eyes at the sheer peace of it.</p>

            <p>The Swedes have a word—lagom—that means "just enough," the perfect amount. Gothenburg embodies this principle. Yet even this restraint hides depths: the city gave the world Volvo and the Gothenburg Symphony, ABBA collaborator Benny Andersson and crime novelist Camilla Läckberg. Excellence emerges from modesty here, achievement without boasting. I understood this better after visiting the Volvo Museum, where the story of Swedish engineering unfolds with typical understatement—no bombast, just beautiful machines and the people who built them. Admission cost 150 SEK (€13).</p>

            <p>Dinner came at Sjömagasinet, a waterfront restaurant housed in a former East India Company warehouse. The tasting menu of west coast seafood (1,200 SEK / €110) included langoustines that tasted of cold clean water, halibut that dissolved like butter, and razor clams I'd never encountered before—briny and tender, pulled from waters just miles away. The sommelier matched each course with Swedish wines I didn't know existed, explaining the emerging viticulture of this northern land with quiet pride. Outside the tall windows, the sun barely set, that endless Scandinavian summer twilight turning the harbor golden, then pink, then purple as the hours stretched toward midnight.</p>

            <p>This is what I learned in Gothenburg: that excellence need not announce itself, that beauty thrives in restraint, that some cities feel like coming home even when you've never been before. I walked back to the ship through streets still bright at eleven o'clock, the northern summer refusing to surrender to darkness. Young people gathered in parks on blankets, sharing wine and laughter. Families strolled with ice cream cones, children running ahead on short legs. Couples sat on benches watching the harbor, comfortable in their silence. The quiet contentment of a city at peace with itself surrounded me like a warm embrace. I felt blessed to have discovered what Sweden means when it isn't performing for tourists—just living, lagom style, along its gentle western coast.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships typically dock at either Amerika Terminal near Stigberget or Frihamnen, both about 10-15 minutes by tram from the city center. The port area is functional rather than scenic, but excellent public transport makes reaching attractions effortless. Some smaller ships dock closer to Lilla Bommen in the heart of the city.</p>

            <p>From Amerika Terminal, tram line 11 runs directly to Järntorget and the city center. From Frihamnen, tram line 6 connects to central Gothenburg. Single tickets cost 35 SEK (€3.20) via the Västtrafik app or at machines. A 24-hour pass (115 SEK / €11) covers unlimited travel including archipelago ferries—excellent value if you plan to visit the islands.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Gothenburg is remarkably walkable and flat. The city center, Haga district, and Feskekôrka are all within easy walking distance of each other. Trams eliminate longer distances. The archipelago islands involve some walking on uneven paths but nothing strenuous. Wheelchair users will find the city center and trams accessible, though cobblestones in Haga present challenges. Budget 6-8 hours for a satisfying exploration.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Trams:</strong> Gothenburg's extensive tram network is the best way to explore. Lines run frequently (every 5-10 minutes) and connect all major attractions. Single tickets cost 35 SEK (€3.20) via the Västtrafik To Go app—download before arrival. Paper tickets from machines cost slightly more. Validate on board. Trams are accessible with low floors and designated spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Archipelago ferries:</strong> Ferries to the southern islands depart from Saltholmen (tram line 11, 20 minutes from center). Styrsö, Donsö, and Vrångö are the most popular islands. Ferry tickets included with Västtrafik day passes—otherwise pay separately (35-50 SEK each way). Ferries run hourly; check schedules at vasttrafik.se. <strong>Book ahead</strong> not required but arrive early in summer.</p>

            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> The city center is compact and walkable. From Järntorget to Feskekôrka: 10 minutes. To Haga: 15 minutes. To Liseberg: 25 minutes. The Avenyn (main boulevard) connects major areas. Flat terrain and good sidewalks make walking pleasant.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> typically include city tours, archipelago visits, or Volvo Museum trips ($80-150). Going <strong>independent</strong> is easy and saves money—public transport works excellently. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, simply watch the tram schedule.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Gothenburg is one of Scandinavia's most accessible cities. Trams feature low floors and audio announcements. Major attractions have ramps and accessible facilities. Haga's cobblestones are challenging for wheelchairs but the main streets are manageable. Archipelago ferries can accommodate wheelchairs—notify crew when boarding.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Gothenburg rewards <strong>independent</strong> exploration—public transport is excellent, attractions are accessible, and the city is easy to navigate. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> make sense for the Volvo Museum (outside the center) or comprehensive archipelago tours. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Sjömagasinet dinner reservations or guided archipelago kayaking.</p>

            <h3>Feskekôrka (Fish Church)</h3>
            <p>Gothenburg's iconic fish market occupies an 1874 building designed to resemble a Gothic church—hence the name. Counters overflow with west coast seafood: shrimp, langoustine, oysters, salmon, and dozens of other species. Buy prepared sandwiches or cooked dishes for immediate eating (50-150 SEK), or simply browse the extraordinary displays. Open Tuesday-Saturday; closed Sundays and Mondays. Free entry. Allow 30-60 minutes. The upstairs restaurant serves excellent lunches.</p>

            <h3>Haga District</h3>
            <p>The old working-class neighborhood survived demolition threats in the 1970s to become Gothenburg's coziest quarter. Cobbled streets lined with wooden houses painted in muted mustard, terracotta, and sage. Antique shops with treasures spilling onto the sidewalk, independent boutiques, and café after café competing for the best fika. <strong>Café Husaren</strong> serves giant cinnamon buns (kanelbullar) for 65 SEK—a local institution since 1885. Haga Nygata is the main street. Free to wander. Allow 1-2 hours for exploring and fika (coffee break). Best in morning or late afternoon light when shadows soften the cobblestones.</p>

            <h3>Southern Archipelago</h3>
            <p>Car-free islands just 20 minutes by ferry from Saltholmen. <strong>Styrsö</strong> is the largest with shops and restaurants. <strong>Donsö</strong> is smaller and more residential. <strong>Vrångö</strong> is the outermost with wilder scenery. Red boathouses, granite outcrops, swimming spots, and that ineffable Nordic peace. Pack a picnic or eat at island restaurants (lunch 150-250 SEK). Ferries included with day passes. Allow half-day minimum. Bring layers—island weather changes quickly.</p>

            <h3>Liseberg Amusement Park</h3>
            <p>Scandinavia's largest amusement park combines thrilling rides with beautiful gardens. Roller coasters for adrenaline seekers, gentler attractions for families. Entry 170 SEK (€16); rides cost extra (300-500 SEK for day pass). Open April-October with Christmas market in winter. 25-minute walk from center or tram line 5. Allow 3-5 hours. <strong>Book ahead</strong> online for discounted entry.</p>

            <h3>Volvo Museum</h3>
            <p>The Swedish automaker's history from 1927 to today, displayed in a purpose-built museum on the harbor. Classic cars including the iconic PV544 and 240, futuristic concept vehicles, truck heritage, and marine engines. Interactive displays explain Volvo's safety innovations that changed the industry. Well-presented with English explanations throughout. Entry 150 SEK (€13). Located at Arendal, 20 minutes by bus 32 from Brunnsparken or included in ship excursions. Allow 2 hours. Car enthusiasts could easily spend longer exploring the gleaming showrooms.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Swedish Krona (SEK). Credit/debit cards accepted nearly everywhere—Sweden is largely cashless. Some smaller vendors are card-only. ATMs available but rarely needed. Current rate approximately 11 SEK = €1 or 10.5 SEK = $1 USD.</p>

            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Swedish, but nearly everyone speaks excellent English. Swedish is easier to read than hear—many words resemble English or German. Locals appreciate attempts at Swedish: "tack" (thanks) and "hej" (hi) go a long way.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Gothenburg's weather is maritime and changeable. Summer temperatures 18-25°C (64-77°F) with long daylight hours. Rain possible any day—pack layers and a light waterproof jacket. The archipelago can be windier and cooler than the city.</p>

            <p><strong>Food & Drink:</strong> West coast seafood is the star. Räksmörgås (shrimp sandwich) costs 60-100 SEK and is quintessentially Gothenburg. Shellfish platters at restaurants run 400-800 SEK. Kanelbullar (cinnamon buns) are essential fika companions. Coffee culture is strong—expect excellent quality everywhere. Full restaurant meals cost 200-400 SEK for lunch, 400-800 SEK for dinner.</p>

            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> Not expected in Sweden. Service charge is included. Rounding up or adding 5-10% for exceptional service is appreciated but not required.</p>

            <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Nordstan is Scandinavia's largest shopping center. Haga and Magasinsgatan offer independent boutiques. Swedish design items, glassware, and outdoor gear make good souvenirs. VAT refunds available for non-EU visitors on purchases over 200 SEK.</p>

        <details class="port-section faq" open>
          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>Q: Is Gothenburg worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br />
            A: Absolutely. Gothenburg combines excellent seafood, a car-free archipelago, walkable historic districts, and genuine Scandinavian charm without Copenhagen's crowds or prices. It's Sweden's friendliest big city and offers a more authentic Nordic experience than many cruise ports.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I get from the cruise port to the city center?</strong><br />
            A: Tram from either Amerika Terminal (line 11) or Frihamnen (line 6) takes 10-15 minutes to reach the city center. Single tickets cost 35 SEK via the Västtrafik app. A day pass (115 SEK) includes unlimited trams and archipelago ferries.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Should I visit the archipelago or stay in the city?</strong><br />
            A: If weather is good, the archipelago is unmissable—car-free islands 20 minutes by ferry offer a completely different experience. Allow half a day. If weather is poor or time is limited, the city offers plenty: Feskekôrka, Haga, museums, and excellent restaurants.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the best thing to eat?</strong><br />
            A: Start with räksmörgås (shrimp sandwich) at Feskekôrka—fresh shrimp piled on bread with mayo and dill. Seafood platters at upmarket restaurants showcase the west coast's bounty. Don't miss kanelbullar (cinnamon buns) at Café Husaren in Haga.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Gothenburg expensive?</strong><br />
            A: Yes, like all of Scandinavia, but more reasonable than Stockholm or Copenhagen. Budget 150-300 SEK (€14-28) for simple lunches, 400-800 SEK (€37-73) for nicer dinners. Public transport is affordable. Free attractions (parks, wandering, window shopping) offset the costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need?</strong><br />
            A: A typical cruise day (6-8 hours) allows for either the archipelago OR a thorough city exploration. Combining both requires efficient use of time—morning islands, afternoon city, or vice versa. The day pass makes this easy with unlimited transport.</p>
