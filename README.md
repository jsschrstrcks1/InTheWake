# In the Wake — v2.022 (GitHub Pages Ready)

This is your website: pages + a folder called `assets` with pictures/styles.

## Explain Like I’m 5 — How to put it on GitHub

1) **Make a new GitHub repo**  
   - Go to github.com → **+** → **New repository**.  
   - Name it (e.g.) `in-the-wake`. Choose **Public**.

2) **Upload the files**  
   - Open the repo → **Add file → Upload files**.  
   - Drag-and-drop **everything** inside this folder:  
     - All the `.html` files (including `index.html`)  
     - The `assets` folder  
     - `HTML_INTEGRITY_2.022.md`  
   - Click **Commit changes**.

3) **Turn on GitHub Pages**  
   - **Settings** → **Pages**.  
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**.  
   - Branch: **main**, Folder: **/** (root). Save.  
   - Wait a minute: GitHub shows your website link.

4) **Open your website**  
   - Click the link (looks like `https://YOURNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`).

That’s it! When you change a file, upload it again and **Commit** — the site updates.

## Notes
- All pages use the **2.x** style (sticky header, teal ship logo, footer).  
- `assets/styles.css` contains the shared nautical styling.  
- If you see any missing pictures, put the real files into `assets/` with the same names—placeholders were created to prevent broken links.
