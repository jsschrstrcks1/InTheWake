<h2>The Revolutionary Pioneer</h2>
<p>Carnival Fantasy wasn't just a cruise ship — she was a revolution floating on water. Launched in 1990 as the first of the Fantasy Class, she introduced the glass-topped atrium that would define modern cruise ship design for decades.</p>
<p>Designed by the legendary Joe Farcus, Fantasy's interior flooded with natural light through her revolutionary glass ceiling. Every cruise ship with a soaring atrium today owes something to this pioneer. She proved that cruise ships could be cathedrals of joy rather than floating hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Godmother:</strong> Tellervo Koivisto, wife of Finnish President Mauno Koivisto — honoring the Helsinki shipyard that built this revolutionary vessel.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Notes</h2>
<p>Fantasy's 30-year evolution made her increasingly wheelchair-friendly. Each refurbishment brought improvements — better pathways, roll-in showers, enhanced elevator access. Her intimate Fantasy Class size meant manageable distances and crew who remembered returning guests across decades.</p>
