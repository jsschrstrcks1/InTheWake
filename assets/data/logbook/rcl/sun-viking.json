      "markdown": "**Sun Viking was delivered to Royal Caribbean on November 10, 1972, completing the original trio.**\n\n[Song of Norway](/ships/rcl/song-of-norway.html) came first (1970). [Nordic Prince](/ships/rcl/nordic-prince.html) proved it could replicate (1971). Sun Viking refined it—slightly larger, more streamlined, an extra half-deck for expanded passenger capacity. She represented the matured vision of what Royal Caribbean's founding ships should be.\n\nHer maiden voyage departed Miami on December 9, 1972, for a 14-day Caribbean itinerary. She would sail Caribbean waters for 26 years under the Royal Caribbean flag—longer than any of her sister ships, longer than many ships that came after.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Keel laid: May 18, 1971\n- Delivered: November 10, 1972\n- Maiden voyage: December 9, 1972\n- Gross tonnage: 18,556 GT (slightly larger than her sisters)\n- Capacity: 724 passengers (double occupancy, 441 cabins)\n- Length: 563 feet (171.6 meters)\n- Service speed: 20.5 knots\n- Built by: Wärtsilä Ab, Helsinki, Finland\n- Signature feature: Viking Crown Lounge (inspired by Seattle Space Needle)\n- Retired from Royal Caribbean: 1998 (after 26 years of service)\n- Final fate: Scrapped February 2022 at Gadani Ship Breaking Yard, Pakistan—50 years after entering service\n\n**What made Sun Viking significant:**\n\nShe was the refined version—the iteration that incorporated lessons learned from Song of Norway and Nordic Prince. Her Viking Crown Lounge was cantilevered from the funnel in a design directly inspired by Seattle's Space Needle, creating an iconic silhouette that became synonymous with Royal Caribbean.\n\nSun Viking introduced thousands of passengers to their first cruise experience throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She sailed 7-day Caribbean loops, 14-day grand Caribbean itineraries, Mexican Riviera cruises from the West Coast, and regular departures from San Juan, Puerto Rico. She was versatile, reliable, beloved.\n\nWhen new mega-ships like [Sovereign of the Seas](/ships/rcl/sovereign-of-the-seas.html) (1988) arrived, Sun Viking didn't become obsolete—she found her niche serving passengers who preferred smaller ships, intimate atmospheres, the charm of the original Royal Caribbean experience.",

      "markdown": "**Documented passenger memories (from forums, reviews, and historical accounts):**\n\n\"My parents' honeymoon, 1975. Sun Viking, two weeks in the Caribbean. They brought back slides—formal dinners, steel drum bands, sunsets from the Viking Crown Lounge.\"\n\n\"Themed nights in the 1980s: 50s and 60s rock-and-roll, Country Western, formal black-tie evenings. The crew knew how to make it special.\"\n\n\"After fourteen days, everyone knew everyone. You'd exchange addresses, promise to write. Some actually did.\"\n\n\"The dining room felt grand—white tablecloths, professional waiters who remembered your name and your drink order by night three.\"\n\n\"She wasn't the biggest, wasn't the newest. But she was ours. Familiar. Reliable.\"\n\n\"When I heard she'd been scrapped in 2022, I cried. She lasted fifty years—longer than most marriages.\"\n\n**Historical significance:**\n\nSun Viking outlasted her sisters: Song of Norway retired in 1996, Nordic Prince in 1995. Sun Viking sailed for Royal Caribbean until 1998—26 years under the original flag, the longest tenure of any founding-era ship.\n\nAfter leaving Royal Caribbean, she had multiple lives: Star Cruises' SuperStar Sagittarius (1998), Hyundai Pongrae (1998-2003), and several subsequent owners. She sailed Asian waters, Korean waters, laid up for years, reactivated, laid up again. Through it all, she survived.\n\nHer final voyage came in February 2022 when she was towed to Gadani Ship Breaking Yard in Pakistan. She was 50 years old—a lifespan almost unheard of for cruise ships. Most are scrapped by age 30. Sun Viking served two full generations.\n\n**Industry legacy:**\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge concept—refined and perfected on Sun Viking—became Royal Caribbean's signature architectural feature for decades. [Voyager class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), [Freedom class](/ships/rcl/freedom-of-the-seas.html), and [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) all carried forward the concept: high observation lounges with panoramic views, gathering spaces that celebrated the ocean and sky.\n\nSun Viking's longevity proved that well-built ships with solid bones could adapt, survive, serve multiple purposes across multiple decades. Her Finnish shipbuilders created something that lasted.\n\n**In memoriam:**\n\nSun Viking was the last of the originals. When she was finally broken up in 2022, it marked the end of Royal Caribbean's founding era—the physical end of the ships that proved Caribbean cruising could work.\n\nShe introduced hundreds of thousands to cruising. She survived industry downturns, changing tastes, the rise of mega-ships. She outlasted her sisters by two decades. She served faithfully for half a century.\n\nRest well, Sun Viking. You earned it.",
