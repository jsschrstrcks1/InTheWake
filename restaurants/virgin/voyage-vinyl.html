      <h3>Voyage Vinyl Review: A Record Shop at Sea (Yes, with Actual Vinyl)</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Voyage Vinyl is Virgin Voyages' curated record shop and listening lounge — a unique space featuring vinyl records for browsing and purchasing, headphones and turntables for listening, music magazines, and a carefully selected inventory of classic and current albums including limited editions. It is part retail, part lounge, and entirely on-brand for Virgin's music-first identity. There is no bar in the space itself, but adjacent bars serve the area. The shop sells vinyl records, and DJ-hosted listening sessions and album parties are held here on select evenings.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>While Voyage Vinyl does not have its own bar, drinks from nearby venues can be brought in. The staff are happy to accommodate guests with drinks browsing the collection. During special events (listening parties, DJ sessions), drinks are served from the nearest bar. Where it falls short: the lack of a dedicated bar is the biggest gap. A venue this music-focused deserves its own cocktail program — themed drinks named after albums, wine pairings for listening sessions, or even a curated beer-and-vinyl experience. The current setup feels incomplete for a space with this much character. You have to leave the atmosphere to get a drink, which breaks the spell.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The staff running Voyage Vinyl are genuine music enthusiasts — they know the collection, can make recommendations based on your taste, and clearly love talking about music. The turntables and headphones are well-maintained and the listening experience is quality (good headphones, proper equipment). DJ-hosted events feature genuine curation and knowledge — this is not a random playlist, it is an intentional musical journey. The vinyl selection includes genuinely interesting limited editions and cruise-exclusive pressings that have collectible value.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Voyage Vinyl is one of the most distinctive spaces on any cruise ship — the design channels a boutique record shop with warm wood, album art displays, and a tactile, analog aesthetic that contrasts beautifully with the digital slickness of the rest of the ship. Flipping through vinyl on a ship in the middle of the ocean is a genuinely pleasurable, meditative experience. The listening sessions add a communal element. The space attracts music lovers and provides a quiet refuge from the ship's party energy. Where it falls short: the space is small and can feel cramped when hosting events. The vinyl prices are premium (marked up significantly from land retail). The selection, while curated, is limited — serious collectors will browse through the entire inventory in 20 minutes. The hours can be inconsistent and the shop is sometimes closed without clear communication.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.8/5.</strong> Voyage Vinyl is a charming, unique venue that perfectly embodies Virgin Voyages' music-first identity — the curation is genuine, the staff are passionate, and the experience of browsing vinyl at sea is unexpectedly wonderful. It falls short on the lack of a dedicated bar, premium pricing, limited inventory depth, and inconsistent hours. <em>Tip:</em> check the app for DJ listening sessions and album party events — these are the best way to experience Voyage Vinyl, and they often feature exclusive insights into the music being played.</p>
