    <!-- First-Person Logbook Entry -->
    <article class="card logbook-entry">
      <h2>My CocoCay Logbook</h2>

      <p>I've lost count of how many times I've visited Perfect Day at CocoCay now — six? seven? — but I remember the first time with crystal clarity. It was 2019, just months after Royal Caribbean's $250 million transformation was complete, and I was sailing on <a href="/ships/rcl/mariner-of-the-seas.html">Mariner of the Seas</a> out of Miami. The moment we rounded the island and I saw those impossibly turquoise waters and the towering waterslides of Thrill Waterpark rising against the sky, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I'd been to plenty of private islands before, but nothing prepared me for this.</p>

      <p>The ship docked directly at the pier — no tenders, no waiting, just walk off and you're there. That alone sets CocoCay apart from most Caribbean ports. Within minutes I had my toes in the sand at Chill Island, a complimentary Coco Loco in hand (the frozen drinks here are dangerously good), staring at water so clear I could see fish swimming twenty feet out. The beaches are immaculate — raked daily, with free loungers and umbrellas scattered across multiple zones so you never feel crowded even on two-ship days.</p>

      <p>But let me tell you about Thrill Waterpark, because it's the headline attraction for good reason. I'm not normally a waterpark person, but when you're standing at the top of Daredevil's Peak — 135 feet up, the tallest waterslide in North America — looking out over the entire island with your heart pounding, you realize Royal Caribbean wasn't messing around with this investment. The drop slide is pure adrenaline, but my personal favorite is the Dueling Demons mat racers where you and three friends can compete side by side. The wave pool is massive and legitimate (none of that gentle ripple nonsense), and kids under a certain age have entire aqua playgrounds to themselves. We spent four hours in Thrill Waterpark on my last visit and still didn't do everything.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> It was late afternoon on my third visit, floating in Oasis Lagoon with my wife, swim-up bar cocktails in hand, watching the sun start to paint the sky orange behind our ship docked at the pier. A steel drum band was playing somewhere in the distance. Neither of us said anything for the longest time — we didn't need to. That's when I understood what Royal Caribbean was really selling here: not just a private island, but the closest thing to perfection a single day can hold. The water was exactly body temperature. The drink was exactly sweet enough. The music was exactly far enough away to be ambient. I've chased that feeling on every visit since.
      </div>

      <p>Oasis Lagoon deserves its own paragraph because it's genuinely incredible — the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean, they claim, and I believe it. It's massive. There's a swim-up bar, floating loungers, a DJ playing poolside, and multiple depth zones so families can share the space safely. I've spent entire port days just here without touching the beach, and that says something. The Coco Beach Club infinity pool is even more luxurious if you book that experience — overwater cabanas, dedicated servers, upscale lunch included — but Oasis Lagoon is free and fantastic.</p>

      <p>The food situation has improved dramatically since the early days. Skipper's Grill serves legitimately good BBQ (the ribs disappear fast at lunch — go early), and Chill Grill covers burgers, hot dogs, and all the sides you'd expect. It's all complimentary. Snack Shack has pizza and chicken tenders for picky eaters. If you upgrade to Coco Beach Club, the dining there is a significant step up — think resort-quality with table service. I've done both, and honestly, the free BBQ with a beach view is pretty hard to beat for value.</p>

      <p>The newer additions have only made things better. Hideaway Beach opened as an adults-only area with its own pool, quieter vibe, and dedicated bar — perfect if you're cruising without kids and want guaranteed peace. Up, Up and Away, the helium balloon that takes you 450 feet above the island, offers the most incredible photos and a completely unique perspective on the whole operation. The zip line across the island is solid fun (1,600 feet), though not as insane as the one at <a href="/ports/labadee.html">Labadee</a>.</p>

      <p>What I appreciate most about CocoCay is that it respects your time. There are no aggressive vendors, no hassle, no stress about getting back to the ship on time. Everything is within a 15-minute walk or a quick free tram ride. The paths are wide and flat and stroller-friendly. The signage is excellent. The app map actually works. You can be as active or as lazy as you want, and either choice feels like the right one. I've done full-on waterpark days and I've done "plant myself in a hammock and don't move for six hours" days, and both were perfect.</p>

      <p>The one thing I'd change? More shaded spots on the main beaches. On very sunny days, the prime shaded loungers get claimed early. But that's what cabana rentals are for, and even the basic cabanas (much cheaper than Coco Beach Club) give you a guaranteed comfortable base. Or just head to South Beach or Chill Island early — plenty of palm trees.</p>

      <p>CocoCay has earned its reputation. The aggregate reviews from thousands of cruisers across Cruise Critic, Reddit, and post-cruise surveys consistently put it at 4.8–5.0 stars, and I understand why. It's the private island experience perfected — Royal Caribbean threw an extraordinary amount of money and thought at this place, and it shows in every detail. From the moment you walk off the ship to the moment you reluctantly walk back on, everything just works.</p>

    <!-- Navigation Section -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Getting Around CocoCay</h3>
      <p>One of the easiest ports you'll ever navigate. Your ship docks directly at the private pier — walk off the gangway and you're on the island within minutes. Everything is connected by wide, flat paved paths and free trams that run constantly throughout the day.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From pier to Thrill Waterpark:</strong> 5–10 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">approximately 6 football fields, 24 blue whales end-to-end, or 528 emperor penguins stacked skyward</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Oasis Lagoon:</strong> 7–8 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">roughly 6 football fields, 24 blue whales in a row, or 528 emperor penguins forming an improbable tower</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Chill Island beaches:</strong> 10–12 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">approximately 10 football fields, 35 blue whales end-to-end, or 770 emperor penguins balancing precariously</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Hideaway Beach (farthest point):</strong> 15 minutes on foot <span class="distance-fun">roughly 13 football fields, 49 blue whales in a parade, or 1,066 emperor penguins forming a questionable Jenga game</span> or 5 by tram</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Signage is excellent throughout, and the free Royal Caribbean app map makes orientation effortless. Tram stops are clearly marked and air-conditioned.</p>

    <!-- Beaches & Areas Guide -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Island Areas: Your Complete Guide</h3>
      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Every zone has its own personality — here's what to expect.</p>

      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1.25rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pools & Water Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oasis Lagoon (Included):</strong> The Caribbean's largest freshwater pool with swim-up bar, floating loungers, multiple depth zones, and poolside DJ. More of a pool party vibe than the beaches. Fills up first — arrive before 10am for prime spots.</li>

    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Timing Your Perfect Day</h3>
      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Strategic timing makes a real difference.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Disembark before 10am</strong> to secure shaded lounger spots. Oasis Lagoon fills up first, followed by Chill Island's prime locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Hit the waterslides early (before 10:30am) or late (after 2pm)</strong> — the mid-morning to lunch rush creates the longest lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Lunch at Skipper's Grill:</strong> Go early (11:30am) for best BBQ selection. The ribs disappear fast.</li>
        <li><strong>South Beach floating bar:</strong> Best visited mid-afternoon when the water's warmest and the party atmosphere peaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Up, Up and Away balloon:</strong> Morning offers clearest visibility for photos; late afternoon has golden hour lighting.</li>
        <li><strong>Return to ship:</strong> Most guests head back 30–60 minutes before all-aboard. If you time it right, you'll have the beaches nearly to yourself that final hour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ships typically dock for 8–10 hours, giving you a full day to explore. The island opens as soon as the ship clears customs — usually by 8–9am.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">No — ships dock directly at the private pier. You simply walk off the gangway onto the island with no tender boats required.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Thrill Waterpark included in my cruise fare?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Thrill Waterpark requires a separate day pass purchase through the Cruise Planner. Beaches, loungers, umbrellas, Oasis Lagoon pool, and basic food are all complimentary.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What ships visit CocoCay?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Most Oasis-class and Quantum-class ships visit regularly, along with Freedom-class and many others sailing from Florida ports. It's one of Royal Caribbean's most frequently visited destinations.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is the food really free?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — Skipper's Grill (BBQ), Chill Grill (burgers/hot dogs), and Snack Shack (pizza/chicken tenders) are all complimentary. Coco Beach Club has upgraded dining for those who book that experience.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Does my drink package work on the island?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — your ship's drink package is fully valid at all bars on CocoCay, including the swim-up bars at Oasis Lagoon and South Beach's floating bar.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What are the height requirements for Thrill Waterpark?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Most slides require 42–48 inches minimum height. Daredevil's Peak (the tallest slide) requires 48 inches. Check specific requirements at the park entrance.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Should I book excursions in advance?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — popular add-ons like Thrill Waterpark, Coco Beach Club, and cabanas often sell out before the cruise departs. Pre-booking through Cruise Planner also typically costs less than onboard pricing.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">

      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">When is the best time to get a shaded lounger?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Disembark before 10am. Oasis Lagoon's shaded spots fill up first, followed by prime beach locations at Chill Island. Alternatively, book a cabana for guaranteed shade all day.</p>
