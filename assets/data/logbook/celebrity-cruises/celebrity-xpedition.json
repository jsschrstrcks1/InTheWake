[Celebrity Xpedition](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-xpedition.html) offered something different.\n\nExpedition cruising with premium standards. Naturalist guides as knowledgeable as any vessel. Wildlife encounters as close as regulations allow. But the ship provided what adventure boats couldn't: genuine comfort.\n\nBlue-footed boobies performed their dance feet from my zodiac. Sea lions swam alongside during snorkeling. Giant tortoises moved in unhurried magnificence. Darwin's laboratory surrounded me.\n\n'This doesn't feel like roughing it,' my wife observed.\n\n'Because it isn't,' I confirmed. 'Xpedition is expedition with comfort.'\n\nThe small passenger count\u2014just 100\u2014meant intimate wildlife encounters. The premium service meant recovering in elegance. The combination shouldn't work. It does.\n\n**The truth:** Xpedition delivers Gal\u00e1pagos expedition with Celebrity luxury. Wildlife access matches any vessel; comfort exceeds most. See [our Gal\u00e1pagos guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Xpedition to Gal\u00e1pagos specifically. The expedition experience doesn't require sacrificing comfort.",
