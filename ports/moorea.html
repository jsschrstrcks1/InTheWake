        <h1>Moorea: Where Dreams Take Shape</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Moorea doesn't announce itself quietly. The island rises from the South Pacific in theatrical drama — volcanic peaks stabbing skyward like cathedral spires, their jagged ridges cloaked in every shade of green that exists. From the ship's deck, I traced the island's heart-shaped outline, understanding immediately why Arthur Frommer called this "the world's most beautiful island." That's a bold claim in a region drowning in superlatives, but standing here, watching the sunrise paint those mountains gold, I'm not inclined to argue.</p>

          <p>The tender ride into Cook's Bay or Ōpūnohu Bay is the first gift. You approach slowly, the volcanic amphitheater opening before you, water shifting from navy to turquoise to shades of blue that don't have names yet. This is a tender port — ships anchor offshore, shuttling passengers in small boats. Some people complain about tender ports. I think they've missed the point. The slow approach is part of the magic, letting Moorea reveal herself gradually, the way beauty should be experienced.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at Belvedere Lookout just after sunrise, before the tour buses arrive. Cook's Bay stretched to my left, Ōpūnohu Bay to my right, Mount Rotui rising between them like the island's beating heart. The silence was profound — just wind in the palms and distant waves. A local woman selling pineapple slices from a cooler said something in French I didn't understand, then smiled and pointed to the view. Some moments don't need translation.
          </div>

          <p>Moorea moves at island time. There's no public bus schedule worth depending on, no ride-sharing apps, no hurrying. You hire a taxi (expensive but necessary) or rent a scooter (liberating but requires confidence) or join a tour (social and efficient). The island is small — you can circle it in a couple hours — but that's not really the point. The point is to find your spot in the lagoon, to feel a stingray glide past your ankles, to taste poisson cru made fresh that morning, to understand why people uproot their lives and move to places like this.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you tender ashore.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Tender port — ships anchor in Cook's Bay or Ōpūnohu Bay; tenders shuttle to shore near Le Petit Village</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Points of Interest:</strong> Le Petit Village shops adjacent to tender dock; Belvedere Lookout 20 min drive; beaches vary</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Yes — tendering required; allow extra time; sea conditions can affect operations</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> French Pacific Franc (XPF/CFP); USD and Euro accepted but poor exchange rates at resorts; ATMs limited</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> French and Tahitian; basic English at tourist sites; French phrases helpful</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; scooter/bike/car rental available; coastal road mostly paved; mountain roads steep</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> May-October (dry season, less rain); December-March warmer with occasional tropical showers</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Belvedere Lookout</h4>
          <p>The single most breathtaking viewpoint in French Polynesia — panoramic vistas of Cook's Bay, Ōpūnohu Bay, and Mount Rotui framed by volcanic ridges. Go before 10am for best light and fewer crowds. Short trails lead to three ancient marae (sacred temple sites) nearby — moss-covered stone platforms where Polynesian chiefs once gathered. Included in most 4x4 island tours (~$50 for 3 hours). Accessible by taxi, scooter, or rental car. Half-day minimum with surrounding sites.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Lagoon Tours — Stingrays & Reef Sharks</h4>
          <p>Moorea's signature experience. Guided boat tours to shallow lagoon sandbars where wild stingrays and blacktip reef sharks gather. Wade in crystal-clear waist-deep water surrounded by graceful rays — they brush your legs gently, utterly unafraid. Sharks circle nearby (harmless, curious). Includes snorkeling at coral gardens. Half-day tours ~$80-100. Book through ship or local operators. Not scary — genuinely magical. Bring underwater camera.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Lagoonarium de Moorea</h4>
          <p>Protected lagoon sanctuary accessed by short boat ride. Snorkel among sea turtles, tropical fish, coral gardens in calm enclosed waters. Less adventurous than open-lagoon tours but excellent for families and tentative swimmers. Green sea turtles glide past at arm's length. Half-day tour includes equipment and guide. Popular with shore excursions. Lunch packages available featuring Tahitian buffet on private motu (islet).</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Tiki Village Cultural Center</h4>
          <p>Authentic Tahitian cultural experience — traditional thatched huts (fare), woodcarving demonstrations, black pearl farm tour, and evening dance performances featuring fire dancing and drumming. Lunch packages include poisson cru, chicken fafa, fresh tropical fruit. Not touristy-tacky — genuinely educational. Evening shows (~6pm) showcase Polynesian storytelling through dance. Tour + meal + show packages available. Half-day or evening visit. Reservations recommended.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Tiki Parc Adventure</h4>
          <p>Rope bridges, zip-lines, and obstacle courses suspended through tropical forest. Multiple difficulty levels suitable for ages 6 to adult. Guides provide safety equipment and instruction. More adventure than culture — think Swiss Family Robinson meets Polynesian jungle. Great for active families. 2-3 hours. Located near Ōpūnohu Bay. Book ahead. Wear closed-toe shoes. Surprisingly challenging and rewarding.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Le Petit Village Shopping</h4>
          <p>Small open-air market adjacent to tender dock — convenient for last-minute shopping. Black pearl boutiques (Moorea's signature souvenir), pareos (colorful sarongs), Tahitian vanilla beans, monoi oil (coconut-based beauty oil), local art. Prices negotiable at some stalls. Quality varies — inspect pearls carefully. Coffee shops serve fresh pineapple and coconut. Easy browsing while waiting for tender. 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at tender dock but expensive. Negotiate fare before departure. Full-island tour ~$100-150. No meters — agree on price and route first.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Most efficient option for cruise day. 4x4 island tours (~$50 for 3 hours) hit Belvedere, marae sites, pineapple plantations. Lagoon tours (~$80-100) include snorkeling gear and guide. Book through ship or reputable operators.</li>
            <li><strong>Scooter/Bike Rental:</strong> Popular with confident riders. Scooters ~$40-60/day; bikes ~$15-25/day. Coastal road (60km loop) mostly flat and scenic. International license required for motorized vehicles. Bring sunscreen — zero shade on coastal route.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but overkill for most cruise visitors. Roads easy but parking limited. Scooters more fun, taxis more practical.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Transport:</strong> Forget it. Le Truck (local bus) exists theoretically but operates on mystical schedule. Not realistic for cruise day.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Poisson Cru:</strong> French Polynesia's national dish — raw tuna marinated in lime juice, tossed with coconut milk, tomatoes, cucumber. Fresh, creamy, bright. Every restaurant makes it; every version slightly different. Order it everywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken Fafa:</strong> Chicken baked in traditional underground oven with coconut milk and taro leaves (similar to spinach). Rich, tender, soul-warming. Tahitian comfort food.</li>
            <li><strong>Moorea Pineapples:</strong> Smaller than commercial varieties, golden, absurdly sweet. Grown in volcanic soil. Sold roadside from trucks. Worth the hype. Bring one back to the ship (allowed — declare it).</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Coconut:</strong> Vendors at tender dock sell coconuts hacked open with machetes. Drink the water, scrape the meat. Hydrating and delicious. A few hundred CFP (~$2-3).</li>
            <li><strong>Hinano Beer:</strong> Tahiti's local lager — light, crisp, ideal for lagoon-side sipping. Ubiquitous.</li>
            <li><strong>Tropical Fruit:</strong> Papaya, passion fruit, star fruit, rambutan — absurdly fresh. Markets and roadside stands sell pre-cut fruit salad bowls. Breakfast of champions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrive at Belvedere Lookout before 10am — tour buses descend mid-morning and crowds dilute the magic. Sunrise visits reward early risers.</li>
            <li>Black pearls are Moorea's signature souvenir. Prices vary wildly ($50 to $5,000+). Shop multiple vendors. Understand grading (size, luster, shape, surface). Reputable farms explain quality honestly.</li>
            <li>French Pacific Franc (CFP) is official currency. USD/Euro accepted but exchange rates at resorts punish tourists. Withdraw CFP from ATM if available or pay exact USD and pocket CFP change.</li>
            <li>Bring reef-safe sunscreen — Moorea protects its lagoon ecosystems. Chemical sunscreens damage coral. Check labels.</li>
            <li>Lagoon tours involve wading in waist-deep water with rays and sharks. Wear reef shoes (rocky bottom), bring underwater camera (disposable waterproof cameras ~$15 on ship), secure valuables in dry bag. Life jackets provided for weak swimmers.</li>
            <li>Tahitian vanilla beans make excellent gifts — more flavorful than commercial vanilla, beautiful black pods. Vacuum-seal before packing (TSA-friendly).</li>
            <li>Monoi oil (coconut oil infused with tiare flower) is traditional Tahitian beauty product — hair/skin moisturizer. Small bottles (~$10-15) pack easily. Smells like tropical paradise.</li>
            <li>Tender operations depend on sea conditions. Swells can delay or cancel tendering. Ship announcements will update. Always allow buffer time returning to ship.</li>
            <li>Scooter riders: wear helmet (provided), bring sunglasses (wind/bugs), apply sunscreen twice (you'll burn in 30 minutes), gas up before loop (limited stations).</li>
            <li>Tipping not customary in French Polynesia but appreciated for exceptional service (tour guides, boat crews). 10% generous.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Moorea is a tender port. Ships anchor in Cook's Bay or Ōpūnohu Bay and shuttle passengers ashore via tender boats. Tender dock is near Le Petit Village shopping area.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to see Moorea on a cruise day?</strong><br/>A: Join a lagoon tour (half-day, ~$80-100) for snorkeling with rays and sharks, or take a 4x4 island tour (~$50 for 3 hours) including Belvedere Lookout. Scooters offer independence but require confidence. Public transport unreliable.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is swimming with stingrays and sharks safe?</strong><br/>A: Yes. Lagoon tours visit shallow sandbars where wild rays and blacktip reef sharks gather. Rays are gentle and accustomed to humans. Sharks are small, harmless, and more curious than threatening. Guides supervise. Genuinely safe and magical.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What should I buy in Moorea?</strong><br/>A: Black pearls (signature souvenir — shop quality vendors), Tahitian vanilla beans (flavorful, gift-worthy), monoi oil (coconut beauty oil), pareos (colorful wraps). Moorea pineapples if you want fresh fruit (declare at customs).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br/>A: French Pacific Franc (CFP/XPF) is official currency. USD and Euro accepted but exchange rates unfavorable at tourist shops. ATMs limited. Bring cash (USD or CFP). Credit cards accepted at established businesses.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How much time do I need at Belvedere Lookout?</strong><br/>A: 30-45 minutes for photos and viewpoint. Add 1 hour if hiking to nearby marae (temple) sites. Most 4x4 tours include Belvedere as part of 3-hour island circuit.</p>
