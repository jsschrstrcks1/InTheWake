  "description": "About two times each year, the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Perak Campus will have its landmark hall lighted up - due to convocation. On normal days, the hall looks grand by day but at night it blends in with the darkness.\nI had not done night photography for a long time, so I decided to go for it while the grand hall was looking its best. The lakeside behind the campus' sports complex is the rarely visited part of campus, but also has one of the most stunning views. A short 3 minute bike ride from the main campus road is all it took.",
