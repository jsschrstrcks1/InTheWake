<section><h3>The Final Holiday Class Ship</h3><p>Holiday began the class. Jubilee continued it. Celebration completed it. The third and final Holiday Class ship launched in 1987, representing everything Carnival had learned from her sisters. She was also the last survivor—when Celebration reached Indian breakers in January 2021, the Holiday Class ended entirely. Three ships, three names for celebration, one completed vision of SuperLiner cruising.</p></section>

<section><h3>Legacy</h3><p>The Holiday Class is gone. Holiday, Jubilee, Celebration—all scrapped. The SuperLiner trio exists only in memory and in design principles their successors inherited. They served combined ninety-eight years across various identities. They introduced SuperLiner scale to cruising. Celebration was the final chapter—she completed the class, served the longest, and went last. The completion role extended through her entire career.</p></section>
