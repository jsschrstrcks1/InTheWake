          <h2 id="quick-answer" class="visually-hidden">Quick Answer</h2>
          <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Tender ports are destinations where cruise ships can't dock directly due to shallow water, lack of pier infrastructure, or environmental protection. You'll ride a small boat from the ship to shore — a 5-15 minute journey that's usually scenic but can add 30-90 minutes to your port day.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="tendering-tips">
          <h2 id="tendering-tips">Tendering Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book ship excursions for priority:</strong> Passengers with cruise line shore excursions get first tender tickets — often disembarking 30-60 minutes before independent travelers.</li>
            <li><strong>Or wait until mid-morning:</strong> If you're going independent, either race for early tenders (line up 30+ minutes before scheduled start) or wait until 10-11am when waits drop to 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Return early for peace of mind:</strong> Last tender is typically 30 minutes before all-aboard. Don't cut it close — if you miss the last tender, you miss the ship.</li>
            <li><strong>Check sea conditions:</strong> Rough seas can delay or cancel tender operations entirely. Have a backup plan (ship amenities, alternative activities) if weather looks questionable.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility considerations:</strong> Stepping from a moving tender to a pier requires balance. Crew assist, but those with mobility concerns should discuss accessibility with Guest Services before booking tender port itineraries.</li>
          </ul>

        <section aria-labelledby="accessibility">
          <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility Considerations</h2>
          <p>Tender ports present unique accessibility challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wheelchair access:</strong> Most cruise lines can accommodate wheelchairs on tenders in calm conditions, but may restrict tender access in rough seas. Contact your cruise line's accessibility team before booking.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility aids:</strong> Walkers and scooters may need to be folded/collapsed for tender boarding. Crew will assist.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer risk:</strong> Stepping from a moving tender to a pier requires balance and mobility. Crew assist, but conditions vary.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather cancellations:</strong> Rough seas can cancel tender operations entirely. Have contingency plans.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Best tender ports for accessibility:</strong> Grand Cayman, Villefranche, and Cannes typically have calmer waters and more accessible pier infrastructure.</p>
          <p><strong>Most challenging:</strong> Bar Harbor (exposed to Atlantic weather), Santorini (steep cliffs, crowded), Geiranger (weather-dependent).</p>

          <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p><strong>Q: What is a tender port?</strong><br>
          A: A tender port is a cruise destination where the ship anchors offshore instead of docking at a pier. Passengers travel to shore on small boats called tenders — usually the ship's own lifeboats converted for passenger transport.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: How long does tendering take?</strong><br>
          A: The tender ride itself is 5-15 minutes. Total time from cabin to shore can be 30-90 minutes during peak hours due to tender ticket distribution and queuing.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: Can I skip tender ports?</strong><br>
          A: Yes — staying aboard is always an option. Enjoy the ship's amenities while it's less crowded. Many passengers prefer this at challenging tender ports like Bar Harbor or Santorini.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: What if seas are too rough to tender?</strong><br>
          A: The captain may delay tendering until conditions improve or skip the port entirely. Ship excursion refunds are automatic. Independent bookings (tours, restaurants) typically aren't refundable.</p>
