      "markdown": "**Marina launched in 2011 as Oceania's first departure from R Class intimacy—proving the brand could grow without losing its soul.**\n\nAt 1,250 guests, Marina nearly doubled R Class capacity. The risk: Oceania's loyal guests might reject larger ships as abandoning what made the brand special.\n\nThe gamble worked. Marina maintained Oceania's culinary excellence, destination focus, and elegant atmosphere at larger scale. Guests who feared growth found their concerns unfounded.\n\n[Riviera](/ships/oceania/riviera.html) followed in 2012 as sister ship. Together, the Marina Class became Oceania's primary fleet before Allura Class arrival. These ships carried the brand through a decade of growth.\n\nFor fleet context: Marina represents successful evolution—the ship that proved Oceania could expand thoughtfully. Her design influenced everything that followed.",
