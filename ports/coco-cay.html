        <h1>CocoCay (Perfect Day) Port Guide</h1>
        <p class="port-subtitle">Royal Caribbean's Private Bahamas Island</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>CocoCay — officially "Perfect Day at CocoCay" since Royal Caribbean's $250 million transformation — is Royal Caribbean's private island in the Bahamas. I've visited CocoCay five times, and each visit reinforces why this became the gold standard for private cruise destinations. The island blends pristine Caribbean beaches with purpose-built attractions: Thrill Waterpark with the tallest waterslide in North America, the Up Up and Away helium balloon rising 450 feet, floating cabanas, and Chill Island's powder-sand beaches.</p>

          <p>What makes CocoCay special is the flexibility. Want adrenaline? Hit Daredevil's Peak at 135 feet or conquer 13 waterslides. Want relaxation? Grab a complimentary beach chair and wade into turquoise water. Want exclusivity? Book Coco Beach Club's overwater cabanas. The island handles thousands of guests daily without feeling crowded — Royal Caribbean designed distinct zones that spread people naturally across the 140-acre property.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Major Attractions</h2>

          <h3>Thrill Waterpark ($89-129)</h3>
          <p>The centerpiece: 13 waterslides including Daredevil's Peak, North America's tallest waterslide at 135 feet. The view from the top is breathtaking — then you plunge nearly straight down. Also includes wave pools, lazy river, and kid-friendly splash zones. Book this in advance through the Royal Caribbean app or website — it sells out fast. The price varies by sailing but expect $89-129 per person for all-day access.</p>

          <h3>Up Up and Away Helium Balloon (Free or $)</h3>
          <p>The yellow helium balloon rises 450 feet above CocoCay for panoramic views of the island and surrounding Bahamas waters. Sometimes included for suite guests or Crown & Anchor Diamond Plus members; otherwise around $30-40 per person. Worth it for the photos and perspective on how beautiful this island truly is.</p>

          <h3>Chill Island & Beaches (Free)</h3>
          <p>The main beach areas are complimentary with thousands of beach chairs, umbrellas, and calm swimming waters. The sand is powder-soft, the water is that impossible turquoise you see in postcards. Complimentary food at Snack Shack and Chill Grill means you can spend all day here without paying extra.</p>

          <h3>Oasis Lagoon Freshwater Pool (Free)</h3>
          <p>Caribbean's largest freshwater pool — perfect for those who prefer pools to ocean. Swim-up bars serve drinks (beverage packages work here). In-pool loungers, swim-up DJ booth, and plenty of space even on busy days.</p>

          <h3>Floating Cabanas & Beach Cabanas ($)</h3>
          <p>Private cabanas on the beach or floating cabanas in the lagoon. Prices vary ($299-799+) but include dedicated service, beverage service, snacks, and shade. Book early — these sell out months in advance for popular sailings.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Dining & Beverages</h2>
          <p><strong>Complimentary Dining:</strong> Snack Shack and Chill Grill serve burgers, hot dogs, chicken, salads, and sides all day. No charge. Quality is solid cruise line buffet-level food.</p>

          <p><strong>Captain Jack's ($ - full-service):</strong> Sit-down restaurant with barbecue, seafood, and tropical drinks. Charges apply. Reservations recommended.</p>

          <p><strong>Beverage Packages:</strong> Royal Caribbean's drink packages work at all CocoCay bars. Bars are plentiful across the island. Signature drinks include the Perfect Storm and Coco Loco.</p>

          <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book Early:</strong> Popular add-ons (Thrill Waterpark, cabanas, Up Up and Away) sell out weeks before sailing. Book through the Royal Caribbean app as soon as your cruise opens for pre-booking.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring Cash:</strong> While most things charge to your SeaPass card, some vendors prefer cash for tips or small purchases. U.S. dollars accepted.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunscreen & Sun Protection:</strong> You're in the tropics with little shade outside designated areas. Reef-safe sunscreen preferred. Hats and sunglasses essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Shoes Optional:</strong> Sand and beach entry are fine without them, but some prefer water shoes for rocky areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrive Early for Best Chairs:</strong> Prime beach spots fill quickly. If you want Chill Island beachfront, disembark early (usually 8am-9am).</li>
            <li><strong>Return Times:</strong> Ships usually stay until 5pm-6pm. Last tender or pier access is typically 30-60 minutes before sailing. Don't miss the boat!</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <details class="faq-item"><summary>Do I need to book CocoCay activities in advance?</summary><p>Yes, highly recommended for any paid experiences. Up Up and Away helium balloon, Thrill Waterpark cabanas, and floating cabanas sell out quickly — often weeks before sailing. Book through the Royal Caribbean app or website as soon as your cruise opens for pre-planning. Walk-up availability is extremely limited, especially on busy ships or peak season sailings.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's included for free at CocoCay?</summary><p>All beaches and beach chairs, complimentary dining at Snack Shack and Chill Grill, Oasis Lagoon freshwater pool, non-motorized water sports (paddleboards, kayaks at certain areas), and general island access are free. Thrill Waterpark ($89-129), cabanas ($299-799+), Up Up and Away balloon ($30-40), Coco Beach Club, and guided shore excursions cost extra.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>How does tendering work at CocoCay?</summary><p>Great news — CocoCay now has a pier that accommodates most Royal Caribbean ships. You can walk directly off the ship onto the island with no tendering required. This is much more convenient than the old tender system. Very large ships or unusual circumstances might still tender, but the pier handles the vast majority of visits. Check your ship's daily planner the night before to confirm.</p></details>

          <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is the Thrill Waterpark worth it?</summary><p>If you love waterslides and waterparks, absolutely. Daredevil's Peak is the tallest waterslide in North America at 135 feet — the drop is intense. The park has 13 slides total ranging from family-friendly to extreme, plus wave pools and a lazy river. Typical cost is $89-129 per person for all-day access. It's not included with beverage packages or most promotions. Book early as it sells out. Kids and thrill-seekers love it.</p></details>

        <h3>Author's Note</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">
          I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. Actually, I've visited CocoCay five times across multiple Royal Caribbean sailings, experiencing both the pre-renovation island and the transformed Perfect Day version. Each visit has taught me more about maximizing this private island experience. The details reflect what I've found on the ground, though private island offerings change — always verify current pricing, activity availability, and booking procedures with Royal Caribbean before your cruise.
