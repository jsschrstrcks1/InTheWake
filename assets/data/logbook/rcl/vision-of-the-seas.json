It's been refurbished, but don't expect cutting-edge tech or newest venues. Cabins are smaller. Dining variety is limited. The pool deck is functional, not Instagram-worthy.\n\nBut if you want *cruising*—not theme-parking at sea—Vision delivers. Attentive crew who remember your name. Traditional dining room with proper service. Manageable size where you can find the library, spa, or your cabin without a map. The signature glass-wall design provides panoramic ocean views.\n\nVision is the ship you choose when you understand what it's trying to be: a floating hotel for beautiful ports, designed for travelers who'd rather explore Alaska's glaciers than ride a surf simulator.\n\nSee [other Vision-class ships](/ships.html) for similar intimate experiences, or compare to [Radiance class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) for glass-wall design in a slightly larger package.",

      "markdown": "**Some cruise memories are about activities. Some are about moments. The Viking Crown Lounge gave us both.**\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge sits at the top of Vision of the Seas — a circular, glass-walled space that wraps around the ship's smokestack. Floor-to-ceiling windows. 360-degree views. During the day, it's a quiet bar. At night, it becomes something else.\n\nOur second evening at sea, we went up around 6pm for a drink before dinner. The sun was setting. The ocean was calm. The lounge was nearly empty — maybe six other people in a space that seats fifty.\n\nWe took a table by the windows. Ordered wine. Watched the sun sink into the Caribbean, turning the water gold, then pink, then purple. No music. No announcements. No distractions. Just us, the ocean, and the sunset.\n\nMy wife took my hand. We didn't say anything for ten minutes. Didn't need to.\n\nWe went back every evening for the rest of the cruise. Same time. Same table when we could get it. Some nights were clear and spectacular. Some were cloudy and moody. One night it rained and we watched storm clouds roll across the horizon while lightning flickered in the distance.\n\nEvery night was perfect.\n\n**Why it works:** The Viking Crown Lounge is Vision Class's signature feature — all ships have it ([Grandeur](/ships/rcl/grandeur-of-the-seas.html), [Rhapsody](/ships/rcl/rhapsody-of-the-seas.html), [Enchantment](/ships/rcl/enchantment-of-the-seas.html), Vision). It's high enough to feel removed from the crowds. Glass walls mean unobstructed views in every direction. And because it's not heavily promoted, most guests don't know about it.\n\nGo at sunset. Skip the formal dining rush. Bring someone you want to be quiet with. Order a drink and watch the world turn.\n\nThis is what cruising should be: not packed pools and waterslides, but moments like this. Quiet. Beautiful. Together.\n\nSee our [romantic cruise guide](/planning.html) and [couple's travel tips](/articles.html).",

      "core_insight": "Vision Class ships maintain classic cruise dining traditions that newer ships have moved away from",
      "markdown": "**We requested traditional dining. Same table, same servers, same time every night. The host looked at us like we'd asked for something weird.**\n\nMost Royal Caribbean ships now push \"My Time Dining\" — flexible seating, different servers every night, dine whenever you want. It's convenient. It's modern. It's also lonely.\n\nWe're old-fashioned. We wanted traditional: assigned table, assigned server, assigned time. Dinner at 6pm every night. Same faces. Same conversations. The way cruising used to be.\n\nVision of the Seas still does this beautifully.\n\nOur server was Antonio. Our assistant server was Marco. Our table was for four (just us and one other couple). Every night at 6pm for seven nights.\n\nBy night two, Antonio remembered we liked sparkling water, my wife ordered decaf coffee, and I always wanted the bread basket refilled. By night three, he was making recommendations based on what we'd enjoyed before. By night five, he was telling us about his family in the Philippines and we were sharing photos of our grandkids.\n\nThe other couple at our table — retired teachers from Oregon — became friends. We ate together every night, progressing from polite small talk to genuine conversations about life, travel, books, politics (carefully), and what we'd do differently if we could do it all again.\n\nOn the last night, we exchanged emails. We've stayed in touch. We're planning a land vacation together next year.\n\nThat doesn't happen with My Time Dining. You can't build rapport with different servers every night. You can't form connections with different tablemates every meal. The convenience comes at the cost of community.\n\n**What makes it work on Vision:** Smaller ship (2,000 guests) means the dining room isn't overwhelming. Two seatings (6pm and 8:30pm) give options without chaos. The crew is trained in traditional service — pacing, timing, attentiveness. And because the ship attracts guests who appreciate classic cruising, you're more likely to meet like-minded people.\n\nIf you miss the way cruising used to be — when it was about people, not just ports — choose a Vision Class ship and request traditional dining. You'll remember your server's name. You might even remember your tablemates twenty years from now.\n\nSee our [dining guide](/restaurants.html) and [classic cruising tips](/articles.html).",

      "markdown": "**I've sailed ships with 6,000 guests. I've done river cruises with 150. Vision's 2,000 feels just right.**\n\nMega-ships are impressive. [Oasis Class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), [Icon Class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) — they're floating cities with every amenity imaginable. But they're also overwhelming. Lines for everything. Crowds at pools. Elevators that take ten minutes because they stop at every deck. You see thousands of faces and never the same one twice.\n\nSmall luxury ships are intimate. You know everyone by name. Service is impeccable. But options are limited. One dining room. One lounge. One pool. You can get bored by day three.\n\nVision of the Seas is the Goldilocks ship: not too big, not too small, just right.\n\n**What 2,000 passengers means:**\n- You recognize faces but aren't forced into awkward repeated small talk\n- Dining room has variety but you can get to know your server\n- Pool deck is busy but you can find a chair without warfare\n- Shows and activities have crowds but feel communal, not anonymous\n- Elevators and hallways are navigable without strategic planning\n- Crew remembers you if you want them to, but you're not on display\n\nI'm an introvert. Mega-ships exhaust me. River cruises trap me. Vision gives me space to be alone when I want and community when I need it.\n\nMy wife is an extrovert. She needs variety and activity. Vision has enough restaurants, bars, shows, and activities to keep her interested without overwhelming her with choices.\n\nWe both loved it. That's rare.\n\n**Vision Class sweet spots:**\n- Couples who want options without chaos\n- Solo travelers who want social opportunities without forced interaction\n- Seniors who want manageable size without sacrificing amenities\n- First-time cruisers who aren't ready for mega-ships\n- Experienced cruisers who miss when ships felt human-scaled\n\nSize matters in cruising. Bigger isn't always better. Sometimes right-sized is perfect.\n\nCompare to other mid-sized ships: [Radiance Class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html) (2,100 guests), [Voyager Class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) (3,100 guests).",

      "markdown": "**My husband surprised me with a cruise for our 30th anniversary. He chose Vision because of the glass walls.**\n\nHe'd read that Vision Class ships were designed with panoramic views as the central theme. Glass elevators. Glass-walled lounges. Even the stairwell atriums have massive windows. You're never more than a few steps from ocean views.\n\n\"I wanted you to see the sunrise every morning,\" he said on embarkation day. \"No matter where we are on the ship.\"\n\nThat attention to detail—that's why I married him.\n\nWe spent the first morning finding all the viewing spots. The Viking Crown Lounge at the top. The glass elevators in the Centrum. The Solarium with its glass roof. Even the corridor windows on every deck. Vision is built for people who want to actually see the ocean while they're cruising on it.\n\nBreakfast became our ritual. We'd wake early, grab coffee from the Windjammer, and find a window seat. Watch the sun come up. Talk about nothing important. Hold hands like we're still twenty-two.\n\nDinner was equally beautiful. Our assigned table in the main dining room had a window seat—small round table, just the two of us, looking out at whatever water we were sailing that night.\n\nBy day three, the crew knew us. \"The anniversary couple,\" they called us. Someone put a heart-shaped towel animal on our bed. Our server brought champagne we hadn't ordered. The maitre d' moved us to the captain's table for formal night.\n\nSmaller ships notice you. That's the difference.\n\nOn the last night, we watched the sunset from the Viking Crown Lounge, then watched the stars come out from the aft deck. Same view we'd had every evening, but somehow more special knowing it was ending.\n\n\"Same time next year?\" my husband asked.\n\n\"Every year,\" I said.\n\nSee our [anniversary cruise guide](/planning.html) and [romantic destination suggestions](/ports.html).",

      "markdown": "**I waited 72 years to try cruising. My daughter finally convinced me. Vision of the Seas was the right choice.**\n\nI'd resisted cruising for decades. Too crowded. Too chaotic. Too many people drinking too much and doing things I didn't want to see. That was my image, anyway—formed from commercials showing pool parties and packed decks.\n\nMy daughter sailed Vision last year and insisted it was different. \"Mom, it's not a party ship. It's a cruise ship. You'll love it.\"\n\nShe was right.\n\nVision holds about 2,000 guests. That sounds like a lot until you compare it to the 6,000+ on newer ships. The difference is everything.\n\nThe pace was calm. No rushing. No fighting for space. I could walk the ship in twenty minutes, learning where everything was. By day two, I navigated confidently. By day three, I felt like I belonged.\n\nThe crew was exceptional. My cabin steward, Mila, learned I liked extra towels and quiet mornings. My dining server, Paolo, remembered I don't drink alcohol and always had sparkling water ready. The staff at the coffee bar knew my order by day three: decaf latte, extra hot.\n\nI didn't feel anonymous. I felt seen.\n\nThe activities suited me. Library time in quiet corners. Classical music in the Centrum. Trivia games that weren't too loud. Cooking demonstrations. Art auctions (just to browse, not to buy). Evening shows that started at reasonable hours.\n\nI never felt pressured to party, drink excessively, or pretend to be younger than I am. Vision attracted guests like me: retirees, couples celebrating anniversaries, multigenerational families. People who wanted elegant travel, not spring break at sea.\n\nMy only regret is waiting so long. I've booked three more cruises since.\n\n**For fellow seniors considering a first cruise:** Start with a smaller ship. Vision Class, [Radiance Class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html), or similar mid-sized vessels. Avoid the mega-ships until you know you love cruising.

Planning one at sea seemed impossible. My parents are in their 80s. My kids are 8 and 11. My brother has teenagers. My sister brought her toddler. Everyone has different needs, interests, and energy levels.\n\nThe travel agent suggested a mega-ship with \"something for everyone.\" We chose Vision instead—smaller, simpler, and most importantly, manageable.\n\nBest decision we could have made.\n\nOn a ship with 2,000 guests instead of 6,000, we could actually find each other. The pool deck wasn't a mile long. The dining room wasn't split across three venues. The meeting spots were obvious: the Centrum atrium, the main pool, the pizza place. When Grandma wanted to rest and the kids wanted to swim, we were never more than five minutes apart.\n\nThe logistics worked. Kids went to Adventure Ocean in the mornings. Grandparents had coffee in the Solarium (adults-only, quiet). Parents caught up with each other while the little ones were occupied. We'd reunite for lunch, scatter again for afternoon activities, then come together for dinner every night.\n\nDinner was the magic. We had a long table in the main dining room—all 14 of us, every night, 6pm. The kids learned to sit still (mostly). Grandma told stories about the old country. The teenagers were forced off their phones. Actual conversations happened.\n\nBy the end of the week, my 8-year-old knew his great-grandmother's recipes. My dad had taught the teenagers to play poker. My brother and I had talked more than we had in five years.\n\nThat's what a family reunion should be. And Vision's size made it possible—small enough to stay connected, big enough to have activities for everyone.\n\nSee our [family cruise planning guide](/planning.html) and [multigenerational travel tips](/articles.html).",

Cruise ships looked overwhelming—thousands of people, loud music, packed pools. My therapist at the VA had worked with me on crowds, but knowing my limits and testing them on vacation felt risky.\n\nWe chose Vision because it was smaller. 2,000 guests instead of 6,000. She'd done research. She knew what I needed.\n\nThe first day was still hard. Embarkation crowds, unfamiliar spaces, too much noise. But by day two, I'd found my spots.\n\nThe library: quiet, empty chairs, books I could get lost in. The aft deck at night: dark, peaceful, just the sound of the wake. The Viking Crown Lounge in early morning: deserted except for one bartender setting up, happy to let me sit with coffee and watch the ocean.\n\nVision had routines I could count on. Breakfast opened at 7. Lunch at noon. Dinner at 6. Shows at 8:30. After a few days, I knew what to expect, and that predictability helped more than I can explain.\n\nThe crew was professional without being intrusive. They noticed I preferred quiet corners and didn't try to draw me into activities. My cabin steward learned I liked my room made up early so I could return to a calm space. Small things that made a big difference.\n\nMy wife got the cruise experience she wanted—shows, pools, activities. I got the peace I needed. We met for meals and excursions, both getting what we came for.\n\nI've cruised twice more since. Each time on smaller ships. Each time finding my spots, my routines, my peace.\n\n**For fellow veterans:** If crowds and chaos are hard, smaller ships help. Vision Class, [Radiance Class](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html)—anything under 2,500 guests is more manageable. Find your quiet spots early. Embrace the routines.

Our first cruise was our honeymoon. Our last was Vision of the Seas, two years before she got sick. Going back felt like honoring her, not avoiding grief.\n\nI requested our same cabin category. Same dinner seating time. Same travel advisor who'd booked us for decades.\n\nThe first night was hard. Dinner alone at a table for two, looking at the empty chair where Linda should have been. My server—a young woman named Maria—noticed.\n\nShe didn't say anything pitying. Just touched my shoulder briefly and made sure my water glass was always full.\n\nBy night two, she'd moved me to a larger table. Five other solo travelers, all of us alone for different reasons. A widow from Boston. A retired professor traveling after his divorce. A woman whose husband couldn't travel anymore due to health.\n\nWe became a group. Breakfast together. Shore excursions. Evening trivia. Not forced—just... found. The kind of community that forms when people recognize each other's loneliness.\n\nVision's size made that possible. On a mega-ship, I'd have been anonymous. Alone in crowds. On Vision, the crew noticed, cared, and gently facilitated connection.\n\nOn the last night, I went to the aft deck where Linda and I had watched our last sunset together. I brought a glass of her favorite wine. I talked to her a little. Told her I was okay. Told her I'd be back.\n\nI've sailed four times since. Always alone. Always finding community. Always carrying her with me.\n\n**For others traveling after loss:** Smaller ships like Vision help. The crew notices you. Other solo travelers find you. You're not alone unless you choose to be.

      "markdown": "**I use a wheelchair full-time. I've cruised on four different ships. Vision of the Seas was the most accessible—not because of features, but because of size.**\n\nEvery cruise line advertises accessibility. Wheelchair-accessible cabins. Elevators. Accessible bathrooms. All true. But what matters isn't the features—it's the distances.\n\nOn mega-ships, getting from cabin to dining room can be a quarter-mile journey. Elevators are packed. Hallways are endless. By the time you arrive, you're exhausted.\n\nVision is compact. My accessible cabin to the main dining room: maybe 200 feet and one elevator. Cabin to the pool deck: same elevator, different floor. Cabin to the Centrum for shows: three minutes, total.\n\nI could actually use the ship instead of just surviving it.\n\nThe crew made the difference. My cabin steward learned my routines—when I needed help, when I didn't. The dining staff always had a table ready with room for my wheelchair. The entertainment staff saved accessible seating without my asking.\n\nShore excursions were hit-or-miss (that's every cruise), but Vision's excursion desk worked with me to identify truly accessible options rather than just checking a box.\n\nWhat worked best:\n- **Elevators**: Vision has fewer decks and less crowded elevators than mega-ships. Shorter waits.\n- **Hallways**: Wide enough for wheelchairs, short enough to not be exhausting.\n- **Public spaces**: Most venues have accessible seating built in, not afterthoughts.\n- **Crew attitude**: Helpful without being condescending. That's rarer than you'd think.\n\nWhat was challenging:\n- **Pool access**: No lift into the main pool. Solarium has better options.\n- **Tender ports**: Always difficult regardless of ship. Ask about tender schedules in advance.\n- **Some venues**: A few bars and lounges have steps without ramps. Research in advance.\n\nFor wheelchair users considering cruising: start with smaller ships. The compact layout of Vision Class makes everything easier. Mega-ships have more features but more distance. Features mean nothing if you're too tired to use them.\n\nSee our [accessible cruise guide](/accessibility.html) and [mobility-friendly ship recommendations](/ships.html).",
