    <!-- First-Person Logbook Entry -->
    <section id="logbook" class="card logbook-entry">
      <h2>Captain's Logbook</h2>

      <p>We woke up docked at the very end of a narrow fjord with sheer granite walls rising thousands of feet on both sides. The morning air was crisp and smelled of pine, saltwater, and fresh coffee from the docks. Skagway itself is literally a movie set — wooden boardwalks, vintage signs, rangers in flat hats and suspenders telling stories like they just stepped out of 1898. Four cruise ships were in port, but the moment we started walking down Broadway, the town's electric energy drew us in. What makes Skagway different from every other Alaska port is that it's not pretending — this town genuinely was the gateway to the Klondike goldfields when word of the August 1896 strike on Bonanza Creek triggered one of history's wildest human stampedes.</p>

      <p>When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer announced the discovery on July 17, 1897, with its famous "Ton of Gold!" headline, the rush exploded overnight. Within a year, nearly 100,000 fortune-seekers poured through this narrow valley, and by June 1898 Skagway had swollen to somewhere between 8,800 and 10,000 souls — making it the largest city in Alaska at the time. Walking these same wooden planks, I could almost hear the chaos: pack mules braying, tent saloons roaring, desperate men shouldering impossible loads toward mountain passes that would break most of them. The Canadian Mounties had required every stampeder to haul one ton of supplies over these passes to prevent starvation in the goldfields — imagine dragging 2,000 pounds up what we were now riding in cushioned comfort.</p>

      <p>The White Pass & Yukon Route Railway is the undisputed star — and rightly called the "Scenic Railway of the World." We boarded the 8:15 vintage train and immediately started climbing the 110-mile narrow-gauge track that hugs cliffs so close you can touch the rock walls. What staggered me wasn't just the scenery — trestle bridges, tunnels, switchbacks, and sudden views of glaciers hanging like frozen waterfalls — but the engineering audacity. Construction began on May 27, 1898, and just eight weeks later, on July 21, 1898, Alaska's first-ever train ran four miles from Skagway — a herculean feat that would take 30,000 workers and two years to complete the full route through solid granite using nothing but black powder and crude hand tools.</p>

      <p>By February 1899 they'd reached the 2,885-foot summit of White Pass, and when we crested that same spot the wind hit us like a wall — cold, sharp, tasting of snow even in July. The railway earned designation as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1994, and standing on that open platform with the whistle shrieking and the abyss yawning below, I understood why. Thousands of pack horses died on the infamous Dead Horse Trail below us; the guide said bones still surface after heavy rains.</p>

      <p>Back down we joined the free National Park Service walking tour through the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park — much of downtown Skagway is preserved as a living museum, and the rangers don't just recite facts, they inhabit the stories. We heard about Soapy Smith's con games and his violent end in July 1898, when he was shot and killed in a gunfight with surveyor Frank Reid on Juneau Wharf — both men died from their wounds, Reid four days later, hailed as the hero who ended Soapy's reign of crime. The rangers also showed us brothels disguised as "dress shops" — wild west perfection with footnotes.</p>

      <p>The Moore Homestead cabin stands as a quiet counterpoint to all this chaos: Billy Moore had filed a 160-acre homestead claim here back in 1887, built a cabin, wharf, and sawmill, dreaming of a town that would serve prospectors heading to the interior — and when the stampede hit, his vision exploded beyond anything he could have imagined. Lunch was reindeer sausage with grilled onions on a sourdough bun from the Skagway Fish Company, eaten on a bench while watching floatplanes take off.</p>

      <p>Afternoon we hiked the first mile of the Chilkoot Trail — the shorter but brutally steeper alternative route the stampeders used when Dead Horse Trail became impassable. Even that first mile was steep, rooty stairs through spruce forest that smelled of moss and old snow, but the sense of walking in the literal boot-prints of desperation and hope was overwhelming. I kept thinking: they did this with a ton of gear. We had water bottles and complaining knees.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing alone on the open rear platform of the train car as we rounded Dead Horse Gulch, wind whipping tears from my eyes, staring 3,000 feet straight down to the tiny toy town and ships while the whistle echoed off the canyon walls like the ghosts of the stampeders were riding with us.
      </div>

      <p>The pros: most authentic Gold Rush town left standing, the railway is bucket-list material, and everything is compact and walkable. The National Park Service rangers offer some of the best free tours in Alaska.</p>

      <p>The cons: it gets crowded mid-day when multiple ships are in, and most shops close early. Book the earliest train possible for best light and smaller crowds.</p>

      <p>Practical tips: Wear real shoes — boardwalks get slippery when wet. Bring a light jacket even if it's sunny at sea level; the summit is always 15–20°F colder. And book ahead — the White Pass Railway sells out months in advance during peak season.</p>

    <!-- Cruise Port Section -->
    <section id="cruise_port" class="card">
      <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
      <p>Skagway welcomes approximately 1.2 million cruise passengers annually despite having a year-round population of just 1,100. The town operates four primary docking facilities: Broadway Dock at the end of Broadway Street, Railroad Dock at the southern end near the White Pass depot, Ore Dock at the end of Main Street, and Ferry Dock for smaller vessels. All docks place you within steps of the historic district — you're already in town the moment you step off the gangway.</p>
      <p>Unlike larger Alaska ports, Skagway has no industrial port area to traverse. Ships dock directly at the waterfront, and the wooden boardwalks of Broadway Street begin immediately. The White Pass & Yukon Route Railway depot sits adjacent to the Railroad Dock, making train excursions incredibly convenient — walk off your ship and onto your train. On peak days when four or more large ships arrive, the small town can feel crowded, but the compact layout means attractions are never more than a 10-minute walk away.</p>
      <p>Port facilities include visitor information centers near each dock, public restrooms, and easy access to the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park visitor center on Broadway. ATMs are available throughout downtown. The entire historic district is flat and wheelchair accessible, though some original boardwalk sections can be uneven.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Getting Around Section -->
    <section id="getting_around" class="card">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Skagway is the most walkable cruise port in Alaska — the entire historic district fits within a few blocks, and you step off your ship directly into town. No shuttles, taxis, or transfers needed for the main attractions. The wooden boardwalks and false-front buildings of Broadway Street start at the dock.</p>

      <h4>Docking</h4>
      <p>Ships dock at Broadway Dock, Railroad Dock, Ore Dock, or Ferry Dock — all within steps of the historic district. From any dock, you're in the heart of town immediately. The White Pass Railway depot is adjacent to Railroad Dock.</p>

      <h4>Transportation Options</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Walking:</strong> The best way to see Skagway. Downtown is compact and designed for pedestrians. Every major attraction is within 10-15 minutes on foot.</li>
        <li><strong>SMART Shuttle Bus:</strong> $5 all-day pass or $3 each way. Wheelchair accessible service connects the docks to outlying attractions like Gold Rush Cemetery and Jewell Gardens.</li>
        <li><strong>Street Car Tours:</strong> 2-hour narrated tours depart from the pier daily May-September, providing historical context while covering more ground than walking.</li>
        <li><strong>White Pass Railway:</strong> Departs right from Railroad Dock — no transfer needed. Book early for best seats and the morning departures offer better light for photography.</li>
        <li><strong>Ferry to Haines:</strong> Fast ferry takes 45 minutes from the dock adjacent to the cruise terminal. Haines offers different scenery and fewer crowds if you want a quieter Alaska experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Chilkoot Trail Access:</strong> Trailhead is 9 miles from town. Shuttle services available for hikers wanting to explore the first miles of this historic route.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park visitor center on Broadway offers free maps and ranger recommendations. For the White Pass Railway, book at least 60-90 days ahead — this excursion sells out during peak season.</p>

      <h2>Excursions</h2>
      <p>Skagway's excursions center on two themes: the legendary White Pass Railway and Klondike Gold Rush history. Unlike other Alaska ports with diverse wildlife options, Skagway excels at immersive historical experiences. Book the railway early — it's the must-do excursion that sells out months ahead during peak season.</p>

      <h3>White Pass & Yukon Route Railway</h3>
      <p>The signature Skagway experience is this narrow-gauge railway climbing from sea level to 2,865 feet at White Pass Summit. The Summit Excursion (3.5 hours, $150-180) is the most popular option, featuring vintage parlor cars, stunning trestle bridges, tunnels carved through solid granite, and views of waterfalls, glaciers, and the infamous Dead Horse Trail far below. For the full experience, choose the train-only option rather than bus return — the descent offers different views and the vintage cars are half the charm. Longer excursions continue to Fraser, BC (passport required) or Bennett Lake (8 hours). Book at least 60 days ahead for summer sailings.</p>

      <h3>Gold Rush Historical Tours</h3>
      <p>The free National Park Service walking tours are among the best ranger-led programs in Alaska — 45-60 minutes of storytelling that brings 1898 Skagway to life. Paid options include the Skagway Street Car Tour ($45, 2 hours) covering more ground with costumed guides, and the Liarsville Gold Rush Trail Camp ($100-130) offering gold panning, salmon bake, and theatrical performances. The Gold Rush Cemetery ($5-10 shuttle) holds the graves of Soapy Smith and Frank Reid, with rangers often stationed to tell their story.</p>

      <h3>Chilkoot Trail Hiking</h3>
      <p>For adventurous travelers, shuttles access the Chilkoot Trailhead 9 miles from town. Day hikers can explore the first few miles of this historic route where stampeders once hauled a ton of supplies. The trail is steep and rooty but deeply atmospheric — you're literally walking in their footsteps. Full Chilkoot expeditions (33 miles, 3-5 days) require permits and planning but offer a transformational wilderness experience.</p>

      <h3>Other Options</h3>
      <p>Jewell Gardens ($30-40) offers a peaceful escape with beautiful gardens and glassblowing demonstrations. Helicopter glacier tours ($300-400) fly over the Juneau Icefield. The Kroschel Wildlife Center ($100-150) provides close encounters with Alaskan wildlife. Kayaking excursions paddle the calm waters of Taiya Inlet.</p>

      <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
      <p>Reserve White Pass Railway 60-90 days before your cruise — these trains sell out quickly, so book ahead to secure your preferred departure time. Morning trains offer better light for photography. Compare ship excursion prices with independent booking; the railway operates its own ticket office at wpyr.com. Free alternatives include the National Park Service walking tours, exploring Broadway's historic buildings, and visiting the museum exhibits at the NPS visitor center.</p>

      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

      <h3>Weather & What to Bring</h3>
      <p>Skagway sits in a rain shadow and is drier than other Southeast Alaska ports, but weather at the summit can change rapidly. Expect sun at sea level and possible sleet at White Pass — layers are essential. Temperatures at the 2,865-foot summit run 15-20°F colder than downtown. Bring a warm jacket for the train even if it's T-shirt weather at the dock.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Skagway worth visiting on an Alaska cruise?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely — Skagway consistently ranks among the top Alaska ports. The White Pass Railway is a bucket-list experience, and the preserved Gold Rush town offers the most authentic frontier atmosphere in Alaska. Walking the same boardwalks where stampeders once walked toward the Klondike is genuinely moving. The free National Park Service tours are exceptional.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What is the best excursion in Skagway?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The White Pass & Yukon Route Railway is the absolute must-do — a 3.5-hour scenic train ride climbing to 2,865 feet through tunnels, over trestle bridges, and past waterfalls with views of the infamous Dead Horse Trail far below. Book the train-only option rather than bus return for the full vintage experience. Reserve at least 60 days in advance.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Can you walk from the cruise port to downtown Skagway?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — Skagway is the most walkable Alaska port. You step off the ship directly into the historic district. Broadway Street with its wooden boardwalks and false-front buildings starts at the dock. Every major attraction is within 10-15 minutes on foot. No shuttles or taxis needed for the main downtown area.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How long is the White Pass Railway excursion?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The standard Summit Excursion is 3.5 hours round-trip, climbing from sea level to 2,865 feet at White Pass Summit before returning. Longer options include the Fraser Meadows excursion (passport required for Canadian border crossing) and the Bennett Lake trip (8 hours). The summit-only trip is perfect for most cruise passengers with limited port time.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What should I wear on the White Pass Railway?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Dress in layers. Even if it's warm and sunny at sea level, the summit at 2,865 feet is typically 15-20°F colder — bring a warm jacket. The open-air platforms between cars offer the best views but can be windy and cold. Wear comfortable shoes for walking around the vintage train cars. Sunglasses help on bright days.</p>
