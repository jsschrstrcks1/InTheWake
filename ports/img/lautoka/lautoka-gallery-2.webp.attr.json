The collection was assembled by Archdeacon A. N. Williamson, who served for many years in the Diocese of Newcastle, as well as travelling extensively in the South Pacific area. The collection vividly portrays town and country life in Australia, particularly in Sydney and the Hunter Valley, soon after the turn of the century. The collection also illustrates life in Japan, Papua New Guinea, Nauru and Fiji, from the turn of the century until the mid-1930s.  \n</p>\nPlease contact &lt;a href=\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"mailto:archives@newcastle.edu.au\">mailto:archives@newcastle.edu.au</a>\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Cultural Collections&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Newcastle Library, NSW, Australia, if you are the subject of the image, or know the subject of the image, and have cultural or other reservations about the image being displayed on this website and would like to discuss this with us.",
