      <h3>Ice Bar Review: A Freezing Gimmick That's Actually Fun</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Ice Bar is NCL's sub-zero cocktail experience, found on Norwegian Escape, Breakaway, and Getaway. The entire bar — walls, seats, glasses — is made of ice, kept at 17°F (-8°C). Guests don parkas and gloves (provided) and get two included cocktails during a timed session (about 30-45 minutes). There's a cover charge ($20-30) that includes the drinks and winter gear.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>Two cocktails are included with your admission. The selection is limited to 4-5 pre-set options — typically a Cosmo, Lemon Drop, Polar Bear (vodka, blue curaçao, and coconut), and an Apple Martini. They're served in glasses made of ice, which is the whole novelty. The drinks are pre-mixed and cold — very cold. Flavor-wise, they're decent but not remarkable. The ice glass melts into your drink over time, diluting it. Drink quickly or embrace the watered-down version. Additional drinks are available at extra charge but aren't worth it — you'll want to leave before drink three anyway because your fingers are numb.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Staff are enthusiastic and keep the energy high — they have to, because standing in a freezer for 30 minutes requires some motivation. The bartender works quickly (everything is pre-chilled) and the host explains the ice sculptures and keeps the group entertained. The timed sessions mean groups cycle through efficiently. Check-in is organized with time slots.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Everything is ice. The walls, the bar, the seats, the glasses, the sculptures — all carved from ice blocks and maintained at 17°F (-8°C). You're given a parka, gloves, and sometimes a hat upon entry. The sculptures change periodically and often feature cruise-themed or destination-themed carvings. It's genuinely impressive for the first 10 minutes. By minute 20, you're ready to leave — it's cold, your drink is melting, and the novelty wears off. The space is small (maybe 20 people at a time), which adds to the experience but also means timed sessions. Photo opportunities are excellent — the LED lighting makes the ice glow blue and pink. It's a one-time-per-cruise experience, not a nightly destination.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.6/5.</strong> The Ice Bar is a fun, memorable experience — especially on a Caribbean cruise where the temperature contrast is dramatic. The cocktails are decent, the ice room is impressive, and it makes for great photos. It loses points for the steep cover charge for what amounts to two drinks in a cold room, and the limited session time. <em>Tip:</em> Book an early session on Day 1 — it's less crowded, the ice is freshest, and you'll have a fun story for the rest of the cruise. Wear closed-toe shoes.</p>
