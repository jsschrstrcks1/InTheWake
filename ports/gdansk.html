        <!-- Logbook Entry -->

          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>Our ship docked in Gdynia, not Gdańsk proper—a detail I'd missed in my planning. But this turned out to be a gift. Gdynia is part of Trójmiasto, the "Tri-city," strung along the Baltic coast like amber beads: industrial Gdynia where we berthed, resort Sopot in the middle, and historic Gdańsk at the southern end. The three cities flow together seamlessly, connected by commuter trains that run every fifteen minutes. I bought a ticket at the station for just 8 PLN (roughly $2) and settled in for the thirty-five-minute journey south, watching apartment blocks give way to church spires as we rolled toward the Old Town.</p>

            <p>The train deposited me near the Golden Gate, that magnificent 17th-century Dutch Renaissance archway marking the beginning of the Royal Route. I passed beneath its weathered stone and stepped onto Długi Targ—the Long Market—and my breath caught. The merchants' houses lining the cobblestones glowed in shades of rose, saffron, and mint, their ornate facades crowned with stepped gables. They looked as though they'd been standing since the Hanseatic League's golden age. However, I knew the truth: nearly every building I was seeing had been rubble in 1945. Ninety-five percent of the Old Town was obliterated. What I was walking through was one of history's most painstaking reconstructions, each façade rebuilt from old engravings, each detail an act of memory and defiance.</p>

            <p>At the heart of the Long Market stands Neptune—a bronze god rising from his fountain, trident in hand, presiding over centuries of commerce and conversation. Cast in the 17th century, he's Gdańsk's guardian and symbol of its maritime soul. There's a local legend I love: Neptune once grew so angry at the revelry in the square that he struck the cobblestones with his trident, shattering gold coins and sending golden flakes swirling into the vodka. Thus was born Goldwasser, the shimmering liqueur still sold in shops around the square, tiny flecks of real gold leaf dancing in every bottle. I bought a small bottle for 45 PLN ($11) to bring home.</p>

            <p>I wandered into the amber shops—then another, then another—because Gdańsk calls itself the "World Capital of Amber," and it's no idle boast. Baltic gold gleams in every window: honey-colored teardrops, deep cognac cabochons, pieces with fossilized insects suspended mid-flight for forty million years. Prices range from 50 PLN ($12) for simple pendants to thousands for museum-quality pieces with prehistoric inclusions. I bought a small pendant for my wife, warm in my palm, a piece of ancient sunlight to carry home. The shopkeeper showed me how to test amber authenticity—real amber floats in salt water and gives off a pine scent when rubbed.</p>

            <p>The Royal Route led me onward, past St. Mary's Church—one of the world's largest brick churches, its tower a 408-step climb for just 15 PLN ($4)—and down to the Green Gate, the 16th-century waterfront palace that closes the ceremonial path. But the gate I needed to find was elsewhere. I asked directions to the European Solidarity Centre.</p>

            <p>The museum is built beside the former Lenin Shipyard, on the very ground where history pivoted. Entry costs 30 PLN ($7.50). In August 1980, electrician Lech Wałęsa climbed the shipyard fence and joined striking workers demanding rights and dignity. The Solidarity movement they forged became the first independent trade union in the Soviet Bloc. It grew into something larger than labor—a moral force that helped topple Communist rule in Poland and sent tremors through the Iron Curtain. Within a decade, the Berlin Wall had fallen. The Centre's exhibits trace that improbable arc: grainy footage of men with mustaches and worn hands, homemade banners, the enormous monument to fallen workers rusting gently in the Baltic air.</p>

            <p>I stood there a long time, trying to hold the weight of it. This wasn't ancient history in a textbook. This was 1980—people my age, scared and stubborn, risking everything on the hope that the world could change. And it did. My heart swelled with something I couldn't quite name—gratitude, perhaps, or wonder at human courage. Tears pricked my eyes, and I felt thankful to be standing on ground that mattered so deeply.</p>

            <p>Back in the Old Town, I found a milk bar for a late lunch—Bar Mleczny Neptun on Długa Street. Pierogi ruskie (potato and cheese dumplings) and żurek soup served in a hollowed rye bread bowl cost just 25 PLN ($6) together. The waitress barely spoke English, but her smile needed no translation. This is what I learned in Gdańsk: that history lives not behind glass but in the streets we walk, the food we share, the stories told by old men in wool caps. The phoenix city had risen from ashes, and walking its reconstructed streets felt like witnessing resurrection itself. I felt blessed to be here, privileged to witness what courage and memory could rebuild.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock in Gdynia, approximately 15 miles north of historic Gdańsk. This is a modern working port with good facilities but limited charm—don't linger here. The real attraction is Gdańsk's Old Town, easily reached by commuter train (SKM) from Gdynia Główna station, a short walk or taxi from the cruise terminal.</p>

            <p>The train journey takes 35 minutes and costs approximately 8 PLN ($2). Trains run every 15 minutes throughout the day. English-language ticket machines are available at the station. Gdańsk Główny station deposits you within easy walking distance of the Golden Gate and Old Town attractions. Currency is Polish Złoty (PLN); ATMs are plentiful and most businesses accept cards.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate.</strong> The Old Town is very walkable but cobblestones require comfortable shoes. Plan 2-3 hours for the European Solidarity Centre, 3-4 hours for Old Town wandering, and factor in train time both ways. The full experience needs 7-8 hours ashore. Wheelchair users should note cobblestoned streets; the Solidarity Centre is fully accessible, and trains accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>From ship to train:</strong> The walk from Gdynia cruise terminal to Gdynia Główna station takes 15-20 minutes, or grab a taxi for approximately 20 PLN ($5). Signs direct you toward the city center. The station has modern facilities including ticket machines with English options and platform displays.</p>

            <p><strong>SKM Commuter trains:</strong> Run every 15 minutes between Gdynia and Gdańsk. Buy tickets from machines (cash or card) before boarding—inspectors check tickets and fine fare-evaders. A single ticket to Gdańsk costs about 8 PLN ($2); consider a day pass for 24 PLN ($6) if you want to explore Sopot beach town between Gdynia and Gdańsk. Journey time is 35 minutes. <strong>Book ahead</strong> isn't necessary—just show up.</p>

            <p><strong>In Gdańsk Old Town:</strong> Everything is walkable. From Gdańsk Główny station, the Golden Gate and Long Market are 10 minutes on foot. The European Solidarity Centre is 20 minutes walk north of the Old Town, or take a taxi for 15-20 PLN ($4-5). Most attractions cluster within a compact area. Comfortable shoes essential—authentic medieval cobblestones are beautiful but uneven.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis and ride-shares:</strong> Available at both ports and the station. Uber and Bolt operate in the Tri-city. A taxi from Gdynia port directly to Gdańsk Old Town costs approximately 100-150 PLN ($25-38) and takes 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. The train is cheaper, often faster, and more scenic.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> typically include bus transport, European Solidarity Centre, Old Town walking tour, and often Oliwa Cathedral organ concert—expect to pay $80-120 per person. Going <strong>independent</strong> saves money but requires self-navigation. For those wanting <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, organized excursions provide peace of mind since Gdynia is distant from Gdańsk.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Gdańsk rewards both organized tours and independent exploration. The key decision: how much structure do you want, and how confident are you navigating a foreign train system? <strong>Ship excursions</strong> provide seamless transport and expert guides; <strong>independent</strong> exploring offers flexibility and significant savings.</p>

            <h3>European Solidarity Centre</h3>
            <p>This is the essential Gdańsk experience—the museum documenting Poland's Solidarity movement that helped end Communist rule in Eastern Europe. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Entry 30 PLN ($7.50). The museum sits beside the historic shipyard where strikes began in 1980. Audioguides available in English (included). Deeply moving, historically significant, and accessible for all mobility levels. Can be reached independently by taxi or a 20-minute walk from Old Town.</p>

            <h3>Old Town Walking Tour</h3>
            <p>The Royal Route from Golden Gate to Green Gate covers Gdańsk's greatest hits: Long Market, Neptune Fountain, Artus Court, St. Mary's Church, and the Motława waterfront. Free to wander independently; guided walking tours cost 50-100 PLN ($12-25) through local operators. Allow 3-4 hours for thorough exploration including amber shop browsing. Mostly level terrain but cobblestones throughout.</p>

            <h3>St. Mary's Church Tower</h3>
            <p>One of the world's largest brick churches, with a tower offering panoramic views over reconstructed rooftops to the Baltic Sea. Entry 15 PLN ($4); tower climb 15 PLN additional. 408 steps—not for those with mobility issues or heart conditions. Views are stunning on clear days. <strong>Book ahead</strong> not required—just show up.</p>

            <h3>Oliwa Cathedral Organ Concert</h3>
            <p>The baroque organ at Oliwa Cathedral, in Gdańsk's northern district, features 7,896 pipes and moving angels. Short concerts run throughout the day; check schedules. Ship excursions often include this. Getting there independently requires additional transit (tram 6 or 12 from Gdańsk). Concert entry by donation (suggested 10-20 PLN).</p>

            <h3>Amber Shopping</h3>
            <p>Mariacka Street is amber central—dozens of workshops and galleries selling Baltic gold in every form imaginable, from simple jewelry to elaborate sculptures and decorative boxes. Prices vary wildly; compare several shops before buying. Simple pendants start around 50 PLN ($12); museum-quality pieces with prehistoric inclusions run thousands. Ask for certificates of authenticity on expensive purchases. No booking needed—just browse at your leisure.</p>

            <h3>Booking Guidance</h3>
            <p><strong>Book ahead</strong> for ship excursions to guarantee spots and transport. <strong>Independent</strong> visitors can explore freely without reservations—trains run frequently and attractions welcome walk-ins. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship, consider organized tours since Gdynia is 35+ minutes from Gdańsk—missing the last train could mean missing the ship. Alternatively, budget extra time and keep taxi numbers handy.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>The phoenix city:</strong> On September 1, 1939, German forces fired the first shots of WWII at nearby Westerplatte. By 1945, Gdańsk was 95% destroyed—the entire medieval Old Town reduced to rubble and ash. After the war, Polish authorities made an extraordinary decision: rebuild everything from historical records, engravings, and surviving pieces. The colorful Hanseatic facades you see today are meticulous reconstructions, each detail restored from memory and documentation. Walking these streets is witnessing what determined preservation can accomplish.</p>

            <p><strong>Amber origins:</strong> Baltic amber is fossilized tree resin from 40-50 million years ago. The Baltic Sea region holds the world's largest deposits, and Gdańsk has been trading amber since prehistoric times. The Amber Road—ancient trade routes carrying Baltic gold to the Mediterranean—passed through here. Prices reflect quality: clear golden amber costs more than cloudy pieces; inclusions (trapped insects or plants) command premiums. Real amber floats in salt water, generates static electricity when rubbed, and smells of pine when heated.</p>

            <p><strong>Solidarity's ripples:</strong> The 1980 Gdańsk shipyard strikes didn't just challenge Poland's Communist government—they demonstrated that ordinary workers could organize peacefully against totalitarian power. The Solidarity union grew to ten million members. Martial law crushed it in 1981, but the movement survived underground. By 1989, Solidarity candidates won Poland's first free elections. The Berlin Wall fell months later. Historians trace the end of Soviet Communism directly to what began on these shipyard grounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Tri-city practicalities:</strong> Gdynia, Sopot, and Gdańsk function as one metropolitan area with excellent rail connections. Sopot offers beaches and a long wooden pier if you have extra time. Polish language is challenging for visitors, but English is widely spoken in tourist areas. Polish złoty (PLN) is required—euros generally not accepted. Tipping 10% is appreciated but not expected. Crime is low; Gdańsk is considered very safe for tourists.</p>
