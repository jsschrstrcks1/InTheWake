# FOM Images Priority Report
## Flickers of Majesty Photography - Ship Image Inventory

**Report Date:** 2025-11-26
**Purpose:** Identify ships with sufficient FOM images for streamlining

---

## Priority Rule

**NEW RULE:** FOM (Flickers of Majesty) images should be featured FIRST in image swipers. FOM images are preferred over Wikimedia Commons or other sources.

For ships with 3+ high-quality FOM images, consider removing other source images to streamline the carousel and feature your own photography exclusively.

## Action Items

1. **Review FOM image quality** - Verify all FOM images are good quality before removing other sources
2. **Reorder swipers** - Ensure FOM images appear first on all ship pages
3. **Streamline 7 ships** - Remove non-FOM images from ships with 3+ quality FOM images
4. **Update attributions** - Add Flickers of Majesty attribution to all pages using FOM images
5. **Document removals** - Track which images were removed for potential future reference

---

## Summary

**Total FOM Images:** 43 across 10 ships
**Ships with 3+ FOM images:** 7 ships
**Images that can be streamlined:** ~12 non-FOM images across 4 ships
**Ships already FOM-only:** 2 (Oasis, Freedom)

This streamlining will:
- Feature your own Flickers of Majesty photography exclusively
- Simplify licensing and attribution
- Reduce carousel complexity on priority ships
- Maintain consistent visual quality across ship pages
