          <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
          <p>Seattle's cruise story is inseparable from the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897, when the city marketed itself as the "Gateway to Alaska" — a title it still holds today. Ships loaded with prospectors departed from Elliott Bay, and the fortunes made outfitting those expeditions built modern Seattle. The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in Pioneer Square preserves this era.</p>
          <p>Pike Place Market opened in 1907 to connect farmers directly with consumers, and it has operated continuously ever since — making it one of the oldest farmers' markets in the nation. The original Starbucks opened here in 1971. The Space Needle, built for the 1962 World's Fair, remains Seattle's most recognized landmark.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: How's Seattle weather before Alaska cruises?</strong><br/>A: May-September is usually pleasant (60s-70s°F). Always bring layers — Seattle weather can change quickly.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: One-way vs. round-trip Alaska cruises?</strong><br/>A: One-way cruises (Seattle to <a href="/ports/vancouver.html">Vancouver</a> or vice versa) see more of the Inside Passage, visiting ports like <a href="/ports/juneau.html">Juneau</a>, <a href="/ports/ketchikan.html">Ketchikan</a>, and <a href="/ports/skagway.html">Skagway</a>. Round-trips are more convenient if flying.</p>
