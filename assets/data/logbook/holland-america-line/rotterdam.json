This Rotterdam represents 150 years of evolution.\n\nThe ship understands its heritage. Dutch design elements appear throughout\u2014the Orange Party celebrating Netherlands culture, the Grand Dutch Caf\u00e9 serving authentic stroopwafels and coffee. The art collection features Dutch masters and contemporary Netherlands artists.\n\nNaming this ship Rotterdam felt significant to HAL veterans. The name had been retired since 2020. Its return on the newest Pinnacle Class ship signaled continuity.\n\n**The legacy:** Rotterdam carries weight beyond her tonnage.
