<h2>The Eternal Second</h2>
<p>Fantasy was first. Ecstasy lasted longest. History remembers firsts; passengers remember best. Carnival Ecstasy outlasted every Fantasy Class sibling, serving 31 years before her final voyage in October 2022.</p>
<p>She was the ship that proved Fantasy's success wasn't a fluke. The second sister, launched in 1991, demonstrated that the revolutionary design could be replicated, refined, and made even more beloved over time.</p>
<p>Ecstasy pioneered Charleston cruising, transformed Jacksonville's relationship with the cruise industry, and carried nearly 5.5 million passengers across three decades of change.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Notes</h2>
<p>Ecstasy's 31-year evolution created exceptional wheelchair accessibility. Her crew developed institutional memory about disability accommodation that newer ships couldn't match — they knew which tables worked best for wheelchairs, which elevator patterns were most efficient, and how to welcome returning guests with invisible disabilities.</p>
