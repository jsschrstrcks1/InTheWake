          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>My ship rounded the Baja Peninsula just after dawn, and there it was—El Arco rising from the sea like a granite sentinel, the iconic arch that marks where the Pacific Ocean crashes into the calmer Sea of Cortez. The morning light painted everything gold and amber, and I felt my breath catch at the sight. Cabo San Lucas is a tender port, which means the adventure begins with a boat ride. I stood at the rail watching crew lower the tenders, eager to start exploring this dramatic meeting point of desert and sea where pirates once hid and whales still breach.</p>

            <p>The tender deposited me at the marina, and I immediately understood why Cabo divides travelers into two camps. Near the waterfront, you encounter resort-town Cabo—beach clubs pumping music, vendors calling from every direction, tourists clutching souvenir margaritas. Walk three blocks inland, though, and the energy shifts completely. I found myself in neighborhood taquerias where locals ate their breakfast burritos, where children played in dusty streets, where Mexico lived its authentic daily life just minutes from the tourism spectacle. Both versions of Cabo are real; which one you experience depends on where you look.</p>

            <p>I hired a small boat to circle Land's End, and that thirty-dollar decision delivered the most memorable hour of my entire cruise. The captain navigated close enough to the arch that I could have reached out and touched the stone—thirty million years of erosion creating this impossible gateway between two oceans. Sea lions lounged on rocky outcroppings, indifferent to our passing. Pelicans dove for fish in the shadows of ancient granite. Then the boat rounded into the Pacific side, and everything changed. The swells grew larger, the water darker, the wind colder. We'd crossed from one ocean to another in a matter of yards. The physical sensation of that transition—calm to chaos in seconds—stays with me still.</p>

            <p>Lover's beach taught me to respect the sea. Our boat dropped us on this famous strip of sand where you can literally stand with one foot in each ocean. The Sea of Cortez side rolled gently against my ankles, warm and inviting. The Pacific side—called Divorce Point for darker reasons—crashed with violent undertow that claims tourist lives every year. A couple wandered toward the Pacific waves, clearly intending to wade in, and our boat captain shouted warnings until they retreated. The boundary between safety and danger here is measured in feet. I swam only on the calm side, watching that deadly surf pound the opposite shore and feeling grateful for the warning.</p>

            <p>December through April transforms Cabo into whale country. Humpback whales journey thousands of miles to these warm waters to breed and give birth, and gray whales pass through on their way to lagoons further north. I joined a whale-watching tour during my February visit, and what I witnessed defied every expectation. A mother humpback surfaced fifty yards from our boat, her calf beside her, exhaling a misty plume that caught the sunlight. Then she breached—forty tons of whale launching clear of the water, hanging suspended for an impossible moment, crashing back in a explosion of spray that drenched passengers on the bow. The boat fell silent. Nobody reached for phones. We simply witnessed something ancient and wild and irreducibly itself. Tears filled my eyes behind my sunglasses, unexpected and unstoppable. Some moments resist explanation; they simply change you.</p>

            <p>Medano offers Cabo's only swimmable main waterfront stretch. The protected bay creates calm water ideal for wading, floating, or launching into water sports. Beach clubs stake their territories along the sand—Mango Deck parties hardest, The Office offers steadier vibes—each providing chairs, umbrellas, food, and drinks in exchange for spending minimums. I prefer finding a palapa, ordering fish tacos from circulating vendors—the lime-drenched fish, the sharp bite of cilantro, the smoky salsa—and people-watching the parade of parasailers and jet skis. The smell of grilling meat mingles with coconut sunscreen and salt spray. A water taxi from the marina costs five dollars and delivers you directly to the sand—far superior to the hot walk around the marina in desert sun.</p>

            <p>San José del Cabo sits thirty minutes away and offers everything its livelier sibling lacks. This colonial town revolves around art galleries, authentic restaurants, and peaceful streets where local life proceeds without tourism's interruptions. Thursday evenings bring an art walk when galleries stay open late and the plaza fills with families. When Cabo's party atmosphere overwhelms, San José provides refuge into something more Mexican and less Spring Break. I spent a quiet afternoon there exploring galleries and eating tacos at a corner stand where no other tourists ventured. The contrast between the two towns taught me that Mexico always offers layers—you just have to seek them.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That humpback whale breaching at sunset, water cascading off her barnacled skin, the entire boat catching its breath in unison. My heart swelled with something beyond words—gratitude, awe, the profound privilege of witnessing wild creatures living their ancient patterns. Some ports offer relaxation; some offer adventure. Cabo offered a reminder that the world still holds wonders capable of bringing grown men to tears. I returned to my ship a different traveler than I'd been that morning.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Cabo taught me that expectations are limitations. I'd prepared for party beaches and tourist traps, and found those easily enough. But I also found fishermen mending nets at dawn, whales singing songs older than humanity, and a meeting of two oceans so dramatic it feels impossible. The lesson isn't choosing between tourist Cabo and authentic Mexico—it's staying open to both, letting each day reveal what it will.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cabo San Lucas operates exclusively as a tender port—no cruise ships dock here directly. Ships anchor in the protected waters of the bay, typically within sight of the dramatic Land's End formations. Depending on traffic, anywhere from one to four ships might share the anchorage, which affects tender wait times significantly. The tender journey takes approximately ten minutes and offers excellent views of El Arco and the surrounding cliffs.</p>

            <p>Tenders deposit passengers at Dock 5 within the marina complex. From there, a pleasant fifteen-minute waterfront walk reaches downtown Cabo, though the marina area itself offers tour operators, restaurants, and shops. Plan your day around tender logistics—most ships remain anchored for four to six hours. Return tender lines build dramatically as all-aboard time approaches, so head back earlier than you think necessary. Get tender tickets early if your ship uses a numbering system, and consider the first or second batch for maximum shore time.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Cabo requires boat transportation to reach its premier attractions. Walking works within the marina and downtown areas, but taxis and water taxis provide essential connections to Medano and beyond. Most attractions concentrate within a compact area accessible by various transport options.</p>

            <p><strong>Water taxi:</strong> The best way from tender pier to Medano—small boats depart continuously from the marina ($5-8), delivering you directly to the sand in minutes. Far superior to the 25-minute hot walk around the marina. Worth the modest cost for convenience and comfort.</p>

            <p><strong>Land taxi:</strong> Available throughout the marina and downtown. Negotiate fares before climbing in—meters aren't used. Expect $10-15 to Medano area, $30-40 to San José del Cabo, $20-25 for a Land's End boat tour pickup. Having small bills ($1, $5, $10) helps with negotiations and tips.</p>

            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> Marina to downtown covers fifteen minutes on a pleasant waterfront path. Downtown itself is compact and walkable. The 25-minute walk around the marina to Medano is doable but hot—water taxi is more practical for most visitors.</p>

            <p><strong>Tour boats:</strong> Land's End tours depart continuously from the marina ($35-50). Glass-bottom options let you glimpse fish during the journey ($40-55). Prices are negotiable, especially later in the day or during slow periods. Most tours circle the arch and include a Lover's stop.</p>

            <p><strong>Mobility considerations:</strong> Tender boats from ship present the primary accessibility challenge—moderate mobility required for boarding/disembarking. The marina walkway is flat and accessible. Medano via water taxi involves stepping into and out of small boats from the waterfront—not wheelchair accessible. Downtown streets are generally flat but sometimes uneven. San José del Cabo offers more accessible sidewalks. Ship excursions can often accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice; check with your cruise line for accessible tour options.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Cabo excels at water-based adventures—the Land's End boat tour is essential, and whale watching during season ranks among the world's best. Independent exploration works well for most activities since you control timing and the tender schedule. Book ship excursions for whale watching or fishing if you want guaranteed return to the ship.</p>

            <h3>Land's End Boat Tour</h3>
            <p>Essential Cabo experience—boats circle the iconic El Arco arch carved over thirty million years at the peninsula's southern tip. See sea lion colonies at Pelican Rock, approach the arch itself, and typically stop at Lover's for swimming between two oceans. Independent boat operators in the marina run $35-50 depending on negotiation skills and season. Glass-bottom versions ($40-55) reveal tropical fish beneath. Tours depart continuously; no booking required. Ship excursions cost more but provide guaranteed timing. Low stamina required—seated throughout.</p>

            <h3>Whale Watching (December-April)</h3>
            <p>World-class encounters with humpback and gray whales during breeding season. Responsible tours maintain appropriate distances while naturalists explain behavior and conservation. Ship excursions run $80-120 and provide guaranteed return timing—important given tender logistics. Independent operators like Cabo Adventures or Whale Watch Cabo run $50-80 but require careful time management. Book ahead during peak season (January-February) as tours sell out. Morning departures offer calmer seas. Moderate stamina—seated but boat may encounter swells.</p>

            <h3>Medano Day</h3>
            <p>Cabo's premier swimming destination with calm, protected waters. Water taxi from tender pier ($5-8) delivers you directly to the sand. Beach clubs like Mango Deck ($30-50 minimum), The Office ($35-50), or Billygan's ($40-60) offer chairs, umbrellas, food, and drinks. Or stake out your own spot—the sand is public, and vendors circulate with food and beverages. Parasailing, jet skis, and paddleboards available for rental. Independent visit—no booking required except for specific beach club reservations. Low stamina for lounging; water sports require fitness.</p>

            <h3>San José del Cabo</h3>
            <p>Colonial sister town thirty minutes away offering art galleries, authentic restaurants, and peaceful atmosphere removed from tourism. Thursday art walks fill streets with gallery openings and local artists. Ship excursions combine San José with other stops ($70-100) and provide guaranteed return. Independent taxi costs $30-40 each way but allows flexible timing. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Moderate stamina for walking galleries and colonial streets. Book ship excursion if concerned about tender timing.</p>

            <h3>Sport Fishing (Half-Day)</h3>
            <p>Cabo's original fame—marlin, dorado, tuna, and wahoo run consistently in these waters. Half-day charters run $350-500 through established operators like Pisces Sportfishing. Budget pangas offer similar experience at lower cost ($200-300). Early morning departures work best with cruise schedules. Coordinate carefully with ship timing—fishing runs unpredictably. Ship excursions provide guaranteed return timing. High stamina for full fishing day; moderate for half-day. Book ahead through ship excursion desk or independent operators during peak season.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Cabo San Lucas sits at the absolute southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, where geography creates one of the world's most dramatic oceanic meetings. The Pacific Ocean's cold, powerful swells crash against the warmer, calmer Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California) within sight of each other. The granite formations of Land's End—shaped by thirty million years of erosion—once provided perfect concealment for pirates ambushing Spanish treasure galleons laden with Asian silks and silver en route from Manila to Acapulco.</p>

            <p>The town itself barely existed until the 1970s when a paved road finally connected it to the outside world. Sport fishing put Cabo on the map first, drawing anglers seeking marlin in waters Jacques Cousteau called "the world's aquarium." Resort development followed, transforming a sleepy fishing village into a tourism powerhouse that now welcomes over two million visitors annually. The original fishing village charm survives in pockets—particularly early mornings when pangas still launch for the day's catch—but modern Cabo runs on tourism, timeshares, and tequila.</p>

            <p>The whale migrations represent ancient patterns that predate human presence. Humpbacks journey 3,000 miles from Alaska to these warm waters each winter to breed and calve, just as their ancestors have done for millions of years. Gray whales pass through en route to calving lagoons further up the Baja coast. These patterns continue despite resort development, cruise traffic, and jet ski noise—a reminder that some things persist beyond human interference. Watching a whale breach against the silhouette of El Arco connects you to timescales that make tourism seem suddenly trivial.</p>

              <summary>Is Cabo safe for cruise passengers?</summary>
              <p>Yes—tourist areas of Cabo San Lucas are safe. Exercise normal precautions with valuables. The violence reported elsewhere in Mexico does not typically affect the Los Cabos tourist corridor. Stick to established tourist areas and official taxis.</p>
