        <h1>Fiji: Where "Bula" Means Everything Beautiful</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>You hear "Bula!" before you see land. Fijians greet ships like long-lost family, waving from shore, calling across the water, grinning with the kind of hospitality that makes you question whether you've been doing life wrong. "Bula" means hello, but it also means welcome, good health, life itself — the whole philosophy of Fijian warmth packed into two syllables. By the time you dock at Lautoka, you've already been adopted into something larger than tourism.</p>

          <p>Lautoka calls itself Sugar City, and the sweet smell of processing cane still drifts across town during harvest season. It's Fiji's second-largest city but maintains a relaxed, almost village-like feel. The Municipal Market bursts with tropical abundance — cassava roots the size of baseball bats, coconuts stacked in pyramids, fish so fresh they were swimming an hour ago. Indo-Fijians (descendants of Indian laborers brought by the British) run many of the shops, adding curry spices and sari shops to the cultural mix. You'll see Hindu temples painted in colors that don't exist in nature right next to Methodist churches where hymns sound like they come from a better world.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting cross-legged on a woven mat in a village outside Lautoka, participating in a kava ceremony. The chief pounded the root while explaining that kava connects us to ancestors, to each other, to the land. When my turn came, I clapped once (as instructed), accepted the coconut shell bowl, said "bula," and drank it in one gulp. It tasted like earthy water someone had run through dirty socks. I clapped three times. Everyone laughed — with me, not at me — and suddenly I was part of something ancient. That's the gift Fiji gives: you arrive as a tourist and leave as family.
          </div>

          <p>The Garden of the Sleeping Giant holds the orchid collection Raymond Burr (yes, Perry Mason himself) cultivated. Thousands of orchids cascade from trees in a valley beneath the Sabeto Mountains. It's peaceful in a way resort beaches can't match. Nearby, Sabeto Hot Springs offers therapeutic mud pools where you coat yourself in volcanic clay, bake in the sun, then rinse off under waterfalls. It looks ridiculous. It feels wonderful.</p>

            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> Lautoka downtown 20 min walk; Municipal Market 15 min walk</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Garden of the Sleeping Giant</h4>
          <p>Raymond Burr's (Perry Mason actor) orchid collection — over 2,000 orchid varieties in lush tropical setting beneath Sabeto Mountains. Meandering pathways, lily ponds, rainforest canopy. 20 minutes from port. ~30 FJD ($13) entry. Cool morning visit recommended. 1-2 hours. Orchid lovers' paradise.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sabeto Hot Springs & Mud Pool</h4>
          <p>Natural volcanic mud pools — cover yourself in warm therapeutic clay, dry in sun, rinse under waterfall. Hot spring pools follow. Looks absurd, feels amazing. Near Garden of the Sleeping Giant (combine both). ~25 FJD entry. Bring towel and swimsuit. 1-2 hours of muddy relaxation.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Lautoka Municipal Market</h4>
          <p>Vibrant local market — tropical produce, fresh fish, handicrafts, spices, root vegetables. Authentic Fijian life, friendly vendors, sensory overload. 15-minute walk from port. Free. Morning best (6-10am). Try fresh coconut water. 1 hour browsing. Bring small bills for purchases.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sri Krishna Kaliya Temple</h4>
          <p>Colorful Hindu temple reflecting Fiji's Indo-Fijian heritage (37% of population). Ornate architecture, religious ceremonies, cultural significance. In downtown Lautoka. Free (donations appreciated). Respectful dress required (shoulders/knees covered). Remove shoes. 20-30 minute visit.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Village Cultural Experience & Kava Ceremony</h4>
          <p>Visit traditional Fijian village, participate in kava ceremony (ritualized drink), learn local customs, singing, dancing. Organized tours essential (not independent visit). Half-day ~$60-80. Authentic cultural exchange — highlight for many visitors. Bring small gift (packaged food/school supplies).</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Koroyanitu National Heritage Park</h4>
          <p>Mountain rainforest, waterfalls, hiking trails, panoramic views. Cloud forests, endemic birds, traditional villages. 45 minutes from port. Full-day excursion via organized tour. For adventurous travelers seeking nature beyond beaches. Moderate fitness required.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Lautoka walkable from port (20 min). Sidewalks adequate in town center. Hot — bring water and sun protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Abundant at port; metered but confirm meter works. Expect ~20 FJD ($9) to Garden of Sleeping Giant. Drivers often offer tours (~$100-150 for 4-5 hours).</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Highly recommended for cultural villages, highlands, full-island tours. Book through cruise line or reputable operators at terminal.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Buses:</strong> Cheap but confusing routes and schedules. Impractical for limited cruise time.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but unnecessary for Lautoka area. Taxis/tours more efficient.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Kokoda:</strong> Fijian ceviche — raw fish (usually mahi-mahi) marinated in lime juice and coconut cream. Fresh, tangy, delicious. National dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Lovo:</strong> Traditional earth oven feast — meat, fish, root vegetables wrapped in banana leaves, cooked underground with hot stones. Usually village/resort experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Rourou:</strong> Taro leaves cooked in coconut cream — Fijian comfort food, like creamy spinach.</li>
            <li><strong>Palusami:</strong> Taro leaves with coconut cream and onions, baked in foil. Rich, creamy, beloved side dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Indo-Fijian Curries:</strong> Fiji's Indian population brought curries, roti, dhal. Excellent Indo-Fijian restaurants throughout Lautoka.</li>
            <li><strong>Kava:</strong> Traditional drink made from pounded root — mild sedative effect, social/ceremonial importance. Tastes earthy. Try it once for cultural experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiji Bitter &amp; Gold:</strong> Local beers — light lagers perfect for tropical heat. Also try Fiji rum (Bounty brand).</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Always respond to "Bula!" with "Bula!" — it's more than hello, it's acknowledging shared humanity. Fijians will appreciate your effort.</li>
            <li>Kava ceremony etiquette: clap once before accepting bowl, say "bula," drink entire contents in one go, clap three times after. Don't refuse — it's considered disrespectful.</li>
            <li>Dress modestly outside tourist areas — shoulders and knees covered, especially at villages and temples. Remove shoes entering homes/temples/some shops.</li>
            <li>Bring small bills (5, 10, 20 FJD notes) for market purchases and tips. Vendors often lack change.</li>
            <li>Garden of the Sleeping Giant + Sabeto Mud Pool make perfect half-day combo (very close together). Many taxis offer package deal.</li>
            <li>If visiting village, bring small gift (packaged food, school supplies, kava root). Never touch someone's head (sacred in Fijian culture).</li>
            <li>Sunscreen BEFORE leaving ship — tropical sun intense. Reef-safe sunscreen appreciated.</li>
            <li>Try indo-Fijian food at market — roti wraps, samosas, curries. Cheap, delicious, culturally significant.</li>
          </ul>
