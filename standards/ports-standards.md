  <h3>November 20th: Revolution Day</h3>
  <p><strong>Important for November cruises:</strong> Mexico celebrates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Day_(Mexico)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolution Day</a> on November 20th each year. If you're in port on this date, plan extra time for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Parades and celebrations:</strong> Downtown streets may be closed for festivities</li>
    <li><strong>Road closures:</strong> Routes between piers and attractions may be affected</li>
    <li><strong>Longer walks back to ship:</strong> Detours around parade routes can add significant time</li>
    <li><strong>Sporting events:</strong> Triathlons and marathons sometimes coincide with the holiday</li>
