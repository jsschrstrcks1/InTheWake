  "description": "Rapa Nui (Easter Island). A view of Anakena, the island's main beach.  It is ideal for swimming and sunbathing.  A second beach nearby was washed away in storms.\n<p>Anakena has palm trees imported from Tahiti in the early 1960's.  It is one of the few places outside Hanga Roa where you can buy food and drink.\n</p><p>It has three original moai platforms.  The carvings on the back of the moai are superb, having been protected by sand from the beach blowing over them.  The rear detail is only seen in the quarry and here.  You can see buttock tattoo designs and the spine line.  There's also a couple petroglyphs on the base stones.\n</p>\nJanuary 2018",
