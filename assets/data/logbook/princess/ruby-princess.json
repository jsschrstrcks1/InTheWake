      "markdown": "**Ruby Princess carries complex history in Australian waters. In March 2020, passengers disembarked in Sydney with what became Australia's largest COVID-19 cluster.**\n\nThe incident prompted government inquiries, policy changes, and lawsuits. Passengers dispersed throughout Australia before testing confirmed widespread infection aboard. The consequences were devastating for many families.\n\nFor Princess Cruises, the incident forced operational reconsideration. The protocols that now govern cruise health emerged partly from Ruby Princess lessons. The industry transformed.\n\nRuby Princess returned to service when cruising resumed. She sails today as evidence that the industry adapted. But Australian passengers who remember 2020 may carry complicated feelings about this particular ship.\n\nThe honest assessment: Ruby Princess remains an excellent Grand Class vessel with Princess quality throughout. The history doesn't change the ship's capabilities. But for some travelers, the history matters.",

      "markdown": "**We sailed Ruby Princess two years after her difficult 2020. The ship we experienced was simply excellent.**\n\nGrand Class fundamentals appear throughout. At 113,000 tons and 3,080 passengers, she hits the sweet spot: large enough for variety, intimate enough for community. The design Princess perfected works.\n\nMovies Under the Stars functions flawlessly. The Sanctuary provides adult retreat. Sabatini's delivers specialty dining that justifies the upcharge. The dining rooms maintain Princess standards.\n\nThe crew seemed especially attentive—perhaps aware of the ship's reputation and determined to exceed expectations. The service felt notably personal.\n\nWe encountered fellow passengers who specifically chose Ruby Princess because the history meant lower prices. Value-conscious cruisers recognized opportunity.\n\nFor travelers considering Ruby Princess: the ship today operates to Princess fleet standards. The 2020 events don't affect 2024 or 2025 sailings. The question is personal—can you separate ship from history?",

      "markdown": "**Ruby Princess sometimes offers lower pricing than comparable Grand Class sisters. For value-conscious travelers, this creates opportunity.**\n\nThe pricing reflects lingering reputation concerns rather than ship quality. [Crown Princess](/ships/princess/crown-princess.html) and [Emerald Princess](/ships/princess/emerald-princess.html) offer identical Grand Class experiences. Ruby Princess offers the same experience at sometimes lower cost.\n\nThe calculation is personal. If Princess quality matters and price matters, Ruby Princess delivers both. The savings fund better cabins, more specialty dining, or future cruises.\n\nThe ship's condition matches fleet standards. Refurbishments maintain contemporary feel. Venues operate identically to sister ships. Nothing about the onboard experience reflects the 2020 events.\n\nFor budget travelers: Ruby Princess represents opportunity. The same Grand Class quality. The same Princess service. Sometimes better pricing. The value equation favors travelers who can separate ship from history.",
