  "description": "Plaque in Golden Heart Plaza in downtown Fairbanks, Alaska.  This plaque was installed in the 1980s with the names of Fairbanks residents.  This photo was uploaded here primarily to illustrate a point made in the book <i>Mr. Whitekeys' Alaska Bizarre</i>, which contains a section on Fairbanks and points out that a man named \"Dick Flopalotofit\" is next to a man named \"Stubby\" on the plaque.",
