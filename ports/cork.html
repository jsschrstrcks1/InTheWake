          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stepped off the ship into Cobh (pronounced "Cove") and the colorful houses rose straight up the hill like a child's drawing come to life—pastel pink, yellow, blue, and green facades climbing the steepest streets I've ever walked. The air tasted of salt and rain, that particular Irish dampness that seeps into your clothes and your soul. This harbor has watched fourteen centuries of unfold—from St. Finbar's 6th century monastic settlement that first put Cork on the map, to the Viking longships that arrived in the 10th century, to the famine ships that carried desperate emigrants away, to the Titanic's last tender on that fateful April morning in 1912. The Rebel County, they call it, because the Irish here have always resisted—invaders, famine, oppression, forgetting.</p>

            <p>St. Colman's Cathedral dominates the skyline, its French Gothic spire soaring 300 feet above the town. I climbed the famously steep streets to reach it, my legs burning by the halfway point, pausing to catch my breath and admire the view expanding with every step. The harbor spread below me, the exact anchorage where Titanic waited while tender boats ferried 123 passengers aboard—the last souls to join that doomed voyage. The cathedral's carillon bells rang out across the water, forty-nine bells playing melodies that have echoed over this harbor for over a century. I sat in the cool darkness inside, the smell of old stone and candle wax surrounding me, and felt the weight of all those farewells pressing down.</p>

            <p>The Titanic Experience destroyed me. I don't say that lightly. Housed in the original White Star Line ticket office—the very building where passengers bought their tickets to destiny—the museum takes you through the entire voyage using the actual names and stories of people who boarded here. I received a boarding card with a real passenger's identity at the entrance: Annie Kate Kelly, age 20, traveling third class to join her sister in New York. The exhibit walks you through the ship, the iceberg, the chaos, the freezing water, and then reveals your passenger's fate. Annie Kate Kelly died. She was twenty years old. For the first time in months, tears streamed down my face—not the polite tear you brush away, but the kind that comes from somewhere deep and demands acknowledgment. I stood at the memorial wall, reading name after name, knowing each one walked through that same door I'd just entered.</p>

            <p>The train to Cork city took twenty-five minutes, rattling past green fields and stone walls and sheep that couldn't be bothered to look up. Cork itself is Ireland's second-largest city, spread across islands in the River Lee, and the English Market has been feeding the city since 1788. I walked through stalls piled with drisheen (blood pudding), crubeens (pig's feet), butter so yellow it practically glowed, and fresh fish still gleaming with the sea. The smell of coffee and fresh bread mixed with the earthier scents of cheese and cured meat. At the Farmgate Café on the balcony overlooking the market floor, I had Irish stew with proper soda bread and a pint of Murphy's—Cork's own stout, creamier and less bitter than Guinness, and fiercely defended by locals.</p>

            <p>Blarney Castle drew me for reasons I still don't fully understand. The castle itself dates to 1446, built by Dermot McCarthy, though fortifications stood on this site since the 10th century. The famous Blarney Stone legend originates from 1602, when Cormac Teige MacCarthy so eloquently delayed surrendering his castle to Queen Elizabeth I that she declared, "This is all blarney; what he says he never means." To kiss the stone, you lie on your back and lean backward over a sheer drop while an attendant holds your waist—it's terrifying and absurd and quintessentially Irish. I did it. My lips touched that smooth limestone and I felt... nothing magical. But I laughed, really laughed, for the first time that day, and maybe that's its own kind of eloquence.</p>

            <p>Evening found me back in Cobh, walking the waterfront as the sun set orange and gold behind the cathedral. A busker played "The Fields of Athenry" on a battered guitar, that heartbreaking song of famine and exile that somehow captures the entire Irish experience. I thought about all the people who'd stood on this same quay saying goodbye—to lovers, to children, to everyone they'd ever known—knowing they'd likely never return. The famine memorial statues nearby show emaciated figures climbing toward ships that offered hope and terror in equal measure. My heart ached for them, for Annie Kate Kelly, for everyone who left this beautiful, sorrowful, resilient island.</p>

            <p>Ireland does something to you. It gets under your skin with its green and its grey and its endless stories of loss and survival. Cobh, more than any other Irish port I've visited, concentrates that emotion into something almost unbearable. You can't walk these streets without feeling the weight of all those departures. But you also can't miss the life—the flowers in window boxes, the music spilling from pubs, the people who still call this harbor home despite everything. My breath caught at the beauty of it, the terrible beauty that somehow contains both grief and joy, both ending and beginning.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Standing at the Titanic pier where the tender boats departed, holding Annie Kate Kelly's boarding card, reading her name among the lost. The cathedral bells tolled noon across the water, and for one perfect, devastating moment, I felt connected to everyone who ever said goodbye on this spot—to the land, to loved ones, to life itself. My heart swelled with gratitude for simply being alive, for having made it to this moment, for being allowed to remember them.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Cobh taught me that some places exist to remind us of the weight of departure—and the equal weight of homecoming. Every joyful tourist walking these streets today is answering the prayers of ancestors who left with nothing but hope. We owe it to them to see clearly, to feel deeply, to carry their stories forward. I boarded my ship that evening a different traveler than I'd been that morning. Some ports change your itinerary; Cobh changes your understanding of why travel matters at all.</p>

          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Cruise ships dock at Cobh (pronounced "Cove"), the picturesque harbor town on Great Island in Cork Harbour. Ships dock directly at the Cobh cruise terminal—no tender boats required. The terminal itself is basic but adequate, with restrooms, tourist information, and a small gift shop. Step off the ship and you're immediately in the heart of Cobh, with colorful houses rising up the steep hillside before you.</p>

            <p>Cork city, Ireland's second largest, lies 25 minutes away by train or 30-40 minutes by taxi. The train station is a 10-minute walk from the cruise terminal through Cobh's charming streets. Cobh itself offers enough attractions for a full port day—the Titanic Experience, St. Colman's Cathedral, Queenstown Story museum—but Cork city adds the English Market, St. Finn Barre's Cathedral, and Blarney Castle for those wanting to venture further. The waterfront promenade connects major Cobh attractions within easy walking distance, though the steep streets to the cathedral require fitness.</p>

          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Cobh is compact and walkable from the cruise terminal, though the steep hills require reasonable fitness. Cork city requires transportation—the train is efficient and scenic. Plan your day based on whether you want to stay in Cobh or venture to Cork and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>On foot in Cobh:</strong> Most Cobh attractions lie within 15 minutes' walk of the cruise terminal. The Titanic Experience is 5 minutes along the waterfront. St. Colman's Cathedral sits atop the steepest streets—allow 15-20 minutes and expect to climb. The promenade along the harbor is flat and pleasant. Comfortable walking shoes essential for the hills.</p>

            <p><strong>By train:</strong> Irish Rail connects Cobh to Cork Kent Station (25 minutes, approximately €7 each way). Trains run every 30-60 minutes. The Cobh station is a 10-minute walk from the cruise terminal through town. Cork Kent Station is centrally located, with the English Market 15 minutes' walk and St. Finn Barre's Cathedral 20 minutes. Reliable, scenic, and recommended for Cork city exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>By taxi:</strong> Available at the cruise terminal. Cobh to Cork city runs approximately €40-50 each way. Taxis can take you directly to Blarney Castle (30 minutes from Cobh, approximately €50-60 each way). Negotiate round-trip fares for waiting time if planning multiple stops.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Popular options combine Cork city, Blarney Castle, and Cobh highlights. Book through ship if you want guaranteed return times, especially for Blarney Castle trips. Independent tours offer more flexibility but require careful time management.</p>

            <p><strong>Mobility considerations:</strong> Cobh's steep streets present significant challenges for wheelchairs and mobility devices. The waterfront promenade is flat and accessible. St. Colman's Cathedral is at the top of a very steep climb with no accessible alternative. The Titanic Experience is accessible on the ground floor. Cork city offers more accessible terrain. Train stations have step-free access. Low-stamina visitors should consider staying on the flat waterfront area of Cobh rather than attempting the cathedral climb.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Cork Harbour is the second largest natural harbor in the world (after Sydney), and Cobh has served as Ireland's principal emigration port for centuries. The town was renamed Queenstown in 1849 to honor Queen Victoria's visit, a name it kept until Irish independence restored the Gaelic "Cobh" in 1920. Between 1848 and 1950, over six million people departed from this harbor—fleeing famine, seeking opportunity, transported as convicts. The statues along the waterfront memorialize this exodus.</p>

            <p>The Titanic connection defines modern Cobh. On April 11, 1912, the White Star liner anchored in the harbor while tenders ferried 123 passengers aboard—the last people to join the voyage. When news of the sinking reached Cobh two days later, the town that had waved farewell became the first to mourn. Three years later, the Lusitania sinking brought more tragedy—the victims' bodies were brought to Cobh, and mass graves in the Old Church Cemetery still receive visitors.</p>

            <p>Cork earned its "Rebel County" nickname through centuries of resistance. The city's burning by British forces in 1920 during the War of Independence remains a defining memory. Terence MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, died after 74 days on hunger strike in 1920, becoming a symbol of Irish resistance. Today Cork channels that rebel spirit into cultural pride—its own stout (Murphy's, not Guinness), its own accent (the famous Cork "lilt"), and fierce local identity that distinguishes it from Dublin's dominance.</p>

              <summary>Is the Blarney Stone worth visiting?</summary>
              <p>If you want the quintessential Irish tourist experience, yes. You lie on your back and lean backwards over a drop to kiss the stone—terrifying and fun. The castle grounds are beautiful. Allow 2-3 hours and expect crowds. 30 minutes from Cobh by taxi.</p>

              <summary>Should I stay in Cobh or go to Cork city?</summary>
              <p>Cobh alone fills 3-4 hours meaningfully: Titanic Experience, St. Colman's Cathedral, waterfront walk. Add Cork city (25-minute train) for the English Market and St. Finn Barre's Cathedral. With a full port day, you can combine both. If time is limited, Cobh offers the most emotionally resonant experience.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How steep are Cobh's hills really?</summary>
              <p>Very steep. The streets climbing to St. Colman's Cathedral are among the steepest in Ireland. Plan 15-20 minutes of uphill walking with rest stops. The views reward the effort, but those with mobility limitations should consider ship excursions with transport or stick to the flat waterfront area.</p>
