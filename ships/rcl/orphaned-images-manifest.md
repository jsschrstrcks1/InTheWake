## Notes

- **Generic numbered files (1.webp, 2.webp, etc.)**: Likely personal photos (Ken/Tina), not ship images
- **Location-based names**: Research the location + date to narrow down which ships visited
- **High-res versions (2560px-)**: May be duplicates of already-used images
- **Multiple photos from same event**: Consider adding all variants to the same ship page

Once ships are identified:
1. Update this manifest with findings
2. Wire identified images into appropriate ship pages
