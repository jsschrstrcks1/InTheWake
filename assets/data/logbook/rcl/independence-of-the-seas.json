Everyone said I should start \"living again.\" I didn't know how.**\n\nMy kids booked me on [Independence](/ships/rcl/independence-of-the-seas.html)\u2014Caribbean cruise, sunshine, distraction. I went to make them stop worrying. Expected to spend the week crying on my balcony.\n\nDay three, bored and restless, I watched teenagers wipe out on the FlowRider. The surf simulator looked ridiculous. They'd try standing, fall immediately, laugh hysterically, try again.\n\nThe instructor noticed me watching. \"Want to try?\"\n\n\"I'm sixty-two,\" I said.\n\n\"So?\"\n\nI don't know what possessed me. But I signed the waiver, put on the life vest, and stepped into the rushing water. Fell immediately. Swallowed half the Caribbean. Came up laughing.\n\nLaughing.\n\nI hadn't laughed\u2014really laughed\u2014since Tom's funeral.\n\nI tried five more times. Fell every single time. Didn't care. A teenager high-fived me. The instructor cheered when I managed to stay up for three whole seconds.\n\nThat night at [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), I ordered steak and wine and texted my kids a photo of me soaking wet, grinning like an idiot. \"Mom?!\" my daughter texted back. \"You okay?\"\n\n\"Getting there,\" I answered.\n\nTom would've loved watching me wipe out. He had the best laugh.\n\n**The lesson:** Grief doesn't mean you forfeit joy forever. Independence's FlowRider gave me permission to be ridiculous again.

Would I have been happier staying in China? My adoptive parents tried to help, but they didn't have answers\u2014just love and good intentions.\n\nThey booked Independence and invited another adoptive family we'd met through support groups. Their daughter, also from China, same age, same questions.\n\nWe spent the week talking. Not to adults\u2014to each other. Sitting on deck chairs, walking the Royal Promenade, floating in the pool. Processing identity in ways our parents couldn't help with.\n\nShe asked if I felt Chinese or American. \"Neither,\" I said. \"Both. Something in between.\"\n\n\"Same,\" she answered. Relief flooded both of us.\n\nAt [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), our families ate together. My mom asked if the cruise was helping. \"Yeah,\" I said. And meant it.\n\nI tried the FlowRider\u2014fell a dozen times, laughed until I cried. The instructor, who had no idea about my identity crisis, said: \"You're a natural. Just needed to find your balance.\"\n\nFinding balance. That's exactly what I was doing.\n\nThe last night, I told my parents thank you. For adopting me. For bringing me on this trip. For letting me ask hard questions without getting defensive.\n\nMom cried. Dad hugged me. We're going to China next year. Together.\n\n**The truth:** Adoption creates complex identity questions. Independence gave me space to process them with someone who understood. See [our adoptee travel guide](/articles.html) and [family bonding packing list](/packing-lists.html).",

Then a stroke at forty-one stole my balance, coordination, half my strength. Doctors said I'd walk again. Surfing? Forget it.\n\nBut my occupational therapist had a crazy idea: \"FlowRider. It's controlled. You can bodyboard instead of stand. Worth trying.\"\n\nMy husband booked [Independence](/ships/rcl/independence-of-the-seas.html) without telling me why. When I saw the FlowRider, I cried. \"I can't,\" I said.\n\n\"Try,\" he answered.\n\nThe instructor was incredible. Assessed my limitations immediately, suggested bodyboarding instead of standing, positioned himself to catch me if I lost balance.\n\nThe first time I caught the wave\u2014just a few seconds, but I was *surfing*\u2014I sobbed. My husband recorded it. I've watched it a hundred times.\n\nBy week's end, I was bodyboarding for thirty-second runs. Not the same as real surfing. But close enough to remember who I used to be.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), celebrating, my husband toasted: \"To stubborn wives who refuse to accept limitations.\"\n\nI'm planning a real surf lesson with adaptive equipment next summer. The stroke didn't take surfing from me. Just changed how I do it.\n\n**The lesson:** Strokes redefined possibilities, not end them. Independence's FlowRider helped me rebuild physical confidence.

My husband and I were exhausted. Family therapy wasn't working. We were ready to just... survive until they left for college.\n\nOur therapist suggested something radical: \"Give them space AND together time. Controlled environment where they can choose independence or connection.\"\n\nWe booked [Independence](/ships/rcl/independence-of-the-seas.html). Told the kids they could spend days apart but had to attend formal dinners together.\n\nThe first three days, they scattered. Oldest at the FlowRider, middle kid at the rock climbing wall, youngest at the ice skating. Fine. Peace was peace.\n\nBut day four, our middle kid wiped out hard on the climbing wall\u2014scraped knee, bruised pride. His older brother, who'd been ignoring him all week, suddenly appeared: \"You okay?\"\n\nThey went to the medical center together. Came back friends.\n\nBy week's end, all three were hanging out voluntarily. Trying the FlowRider together, competing at mini golf, actually *laughing* at dinner.\n\nThe last formal night, they took a sibling photo\u2014arms around each other, genuine smiles. I cried behind my menu.\n\nAre they perfect now? No. They still fight. But they also actually like each other sometimes.\n\n**The truth:** Siblings need space AND connection.

I was the perfect Christian kid\u2014youth group leader, missions trips, Bible college scholarship. Then I got to college and started asking questions nobody wanted to answer.\n\nBy senior year, I'd deconstructed most of my faith. Told my parents I wasn't sure I believed anymore. Dad took it as personal failure. Mom cried. Church people whispered.\n\nMy younger sister, still at home, still believing, suggested we take a trip together. Just us. \"No parents, no church, just siblings.\"\n\nShe booked [Independence](/ships/rcl/independence-of-the-seas.html). We spent the week talking honestly for the first time in years.\n\nI told her I wasn't rejecting faith to hurt Dad. I just... couldn't believe things that didn't make sense anymore. She told me she had questions too but was scared to voice them.\n\n\"You can question and still believe,\" she said. \"Or question and stop believing. Either's okay.\"\n\nPermission I didn't know I needed.\n\nWe tried the FlowRider together\u2014both terrible, both laughing. At [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), we people-watched and made up stories about strangers. Remembered we were siblings before we were theological opponents.\n\nThe last night, she said: \"I still believe. But I love you whether you do or not.\"\n\nBest thing anyone's said to me in years.\n\n**The lesson:** Deconstruction doesn't have to destroy relationships.

Among strangers, I could just... exist.\n\nThe first breakfast at [Windjammer](/restaurants/windjammer.html), I wore a turban. People glanced, recognized the cancer signifier, looked away politely. Nobody asked how I was doing. Nobody offered unsolicited advice. It was *freeing*.\n\nAt the pool deck, I took off my turban entirely. Bald in the Caribbean sun. A little girl asked why I didn't have hair. \"Medicine made it fall out,\" I said. \"Oh. Okay,\" she answered, and went back to playing.\n\nNo drama. No pity. Just acceptance.\n\nBy week's end, I was walking the Royal Promenade completely bald. Not because I'd found confidence\u2014but because I'd found exhaustion. Too tired to perform health I didn't have.\n\nAt [Chops Grille](/restaurants/chops.html), our server said: \"You have a beautifully shaped head.\" Weirdest, best compliment ever.\n\nI'm four months post-chemo now.

The FlowRider is genuinely fun (and often less crowded than on newer ships). The Royal Promenade creates community. Ice skating shows are solid. Activities are plentiful without overwhelming.\n\nBut it's not cutting-edge. Cabins are functional, not luxurious. Tech is dated compared to Quantum-class ships. Dining variety is good, not exceptional.\n\nIndependence is the ship you choose when you want active family fun, proven Royal Caribbean features, and mid-tier pricing.
