      <h1>Endicott Arm: Alaska's Hidden Fjord Where the Ice Has Stories</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>When ice conditions block Tracy Arm – which happens more often than you'd think – ships divert to Endicott Arm, and passengers initially groan. Then they see it. This 30-mile fjord lies within the 653,000-acre Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness, one of the most pristine natural preserves on Earth. John Muir called it "a wild, untamed Yosemite." What feels like a backup plan becomes a gift.</p>

        <p>Our navigator picked through floating icebergs with surgical precision, the fjord dropping 1,200 feet beneath our hull. Seals lounged on ice floes, barely bothering to lift their heads – this is one of the largest harbor seal breeding grounds on the planet. Waterfalls cascaded from walls rising 3,000 feet on either side. The fjord walls closed in until it felt like we'd entered a private wilderness reserved for our ship alone.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Got Me:</strong> A mother seal and her pup were hauled out on an iceberg no bigger than a car. As we drifted past, the mother lifted her head, assessed us, and decided we weren't a threat. She lay back down, her pup nuzzled against her side. That image of trust and peace stays with me.

        <h2>The Fjord Journey</h2>
        <p>Endicott Arm stretches 30 miles into the mountains, with granite walls rising 3,000 feet on either side. The scenic cruising typically takes 4-6 hours, with the ship spending extended time at Dawes Glacier before turning around. It's a slow, contemplative day – exactly what Alaska glacier viewing should be.</p>
        <p>The icebergs themselves are worth studying. Blue ones are centuries old, compressed until all air escaped. White ones are younger, still holding their bubbles. Some have flipped recently, exposing underwater sections polished smooth by the sea. Each one is a sculpture, shaped by forces beyond comprehension.</p>
        <p>Waterfalls appear around every bend – some thin ribbons, others thundering cascades. After heavy rain or during peak snowmelt, they multiply. The water runs milky with glacial flour, minerals ground fine by ice, giving the fjord its distinctive color.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Dawes Glacier</h2>
        <p>Dawes Glacier rises 600 feet tall and stretches half a mile wide – actually two glaciers united by a medial moraine (the ridge where they meet) in the center. The glacier extends 15 miles back into the mountains. Ships can often approach quite close, and the calving activity is frequent, creating the thunderous sound glaciologists call "white thunder."</p>
        <p>Watch for seals on the ice floes near the glacier face. This is prime pupping grounds, and during spring you might see dozens of chubby pups chilling with mom on floating ice. The seals use the ice for protection from orcas – hauling out on platforms where predators can't reach. Look also for humpback whales breaching, mountain goats picking their way along the cliffs, and brown bears in the valleys.</p>
        <p>The water at the glacier face is startlingly active. Chunks of ice pop to the surface after breaking off underwater. Upwellings bring nutrients that attract fish, which attract birds. Bald eagles soar overhead. It's a complete ecosystem built around frozen water.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Fords Terror</h2>
        <p>Off Endicott Arm lies one of Alaska's most dramatic features – Fords Terror, a narrow inlet with tidal currents so fierce that early explorers were genuinely terrified. Cruise ships are far too large to enter, but if your ship offers kayak or small boat excursions here, don't hesitate. It's wilderness Alaska at its most intense.</p>
        <p>The inlet's name comes from a Navy surveyor in 1889 who got caught in the tidal rapids. His crew spent hours fighting currents they described as "terror-inducing." Today, those same currents are navigated by adventurous kayakers and small expedition boats – but only at slack tide.</p>

        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why did my ship go to Endicott Arm instead of Tracy Arm?</summary><p>Ice conditions in Tracy Arm are unpredictable.

        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Endicott Arm as good as Tracy Arm?</summary><p>Many passengers prefer it. Endicott Arm is often less crowded, and Dawes Glacier is beautifully intimate. The wildlife viewing – especially seal pup sightings – can be exceptional.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Can I visit Fords Terror?</summary><p>Only via small boat or kayak, and only at slack tide due to dangerous currents. Some small expedition ships offer this experience. Large cruise ships cannot enter.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>What wildlife will I see?</summary><p>Harbor seals on ice floes are nearly guaranteed. You may also see sea otters, bald eagles, mountain goats on the cliffs, and occasionally bears along the shoreline.</p></details>

        <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
        <p><strong>Endicott Arm</strong> is a spectacular 30-mile Alaskan fjord ending at Dawes Glacier. Often used as an alternative to Tracy Arm, it offers intimate glacier viewing, abundant wildlife (especially seals), and frequently less crowded conditions. Many passengers consider it equally impressive to its more famous neighbor.</p>
