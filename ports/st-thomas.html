      <h2>My St. Thomas Logbook</h2>

      <div class="clearfix">
        <p>Sailing into Charlotte Amalie harbor surrounded by emerald hills dotted with rainbow-colored houses is pure magic — there's a reason this view has graced a thousand postcards. The buildings cascade down the steep hillsides like stacked Lego blocks painted in every shade of coral, yellow, and seafoam, centuries of Danish colonial architecture blending with Caribbean vibrancy. I'm always on the top deck screaming when Magens Bay appears around the bend, that heart-shaped beach backed by palm groves that consistently lands in "World's Best" lists.</p>

        <img class="inline-image" src="/ports/img/st-thomas/fort-christian.webp" alt="Fort Christian, the oldest standing structure in the US Virgin Islands, with its distinctive red brick tower" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>But before I chase the beach, I usually spend an hour exploring Charlotte Amalie's historic heart — a town named for Queen Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, wife of Danish King Christian V, whose name graces this harbor though she never set foot in these waters. <strong>Fort Christian</strong> is impossible to miss — that distinctive brick-red tower took fourteen years to build (1666-1680), rising stone by stone to become the oldest standing structure in the US Virgin Islands. The Danes built it when this was their Caribbean colony, and it's served as everything a frontier settlement needed: church, courthouse, governor's mansion, and jail over the centuries. The small museum inside offers a fascinating window into the island's complex history, from the Ciboney fishermen who first settled these shores around 1500 BC through Danish rule to American acquisition in 1917. Standing on those weathered ramparts looking out at your cruise ship, you're literally standing where Danish soldiers once watched for pirate sails on the horizon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="clearfix">
        <p>My perfect St. Thomas day: off the ship by 7:30 a.m. and straight into a shared safari taxi bound for Magens Bay. These open-air converted trucks are pure Caribbean — wind in your hair, reggae on the radio, driver pointing out celebrity mansions as you wind up the mountain road. The fare to Magens is surprisingly reasonable when split among passengers, and the ride itself (with those vertiginous cliff views) is half the adventure.</p>

        <p>Magens Bay is everything you've heard — voted one of the top-10 beaches in the world for good reason. That impossibly turquoise water stays calm because the bay is protected on three sides, making it perfect for floating endlessly while staring at the sky. I rent two loungers and an umbrella (great value for the whole day) and alternate between swimming, floating, and reading until my soul feels reset. The small entrance fee includes clean facilities, and there's a beach bar when you need a cold Presidente or frozen drink.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Floating on my back in Magens Bay at 10 a.m., completely alone in that crystal water that's earned its place among National Geographic's most beautiful beaches in the world, with zero sound except my own heartbeat and the distant laughter of children building sandcastles on that three-quarter-mile ribbon of powdery white sand. The sun warm on my face, the salt holding me up effortlessly, palm fronds rustling in the trade winds that once guided Danish merchant ships to this very harbor. Realizing I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, floating in the same waters the Ciboney fishermen knew three thousand years ago. That's what St. Thomas gives you — permission to just exist, to be held by history and beauty and salt water all at once.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="clearfix">
        <img class="inline-image-left" src="/ports/img/st-thomas/blackbeard-castle.webp" alt="Blackbeard Castle watchtower perched on a hilltop with panoramic harbor views" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>Around noon I head to Paradise Point, taking the skyride tram from Havensight — a scenic seven-minute ascent 700 feet up Flag Hill (that's roughly 140 average adults stacked head-to-toe, or about 3,500 hamburgers tall, or nearly twice the height of the Statue of Liberty with pedestal). The views from the top are insane: 360-degree panoramas of the harbor, neighboring islands, and your ship looking like a toy in the water below. The bar up top is famous for the Bushwacker — a frozen concoction (rum, Kahlúa, cream, and secret magic) that's become a St. Thomas institution. The combination of those views and that signature drink is why Paradise Point stays packed with cruisers.</p>

        <p>If you're feeling adventurous, <strong>Blackbeard's Castle</strong> is a short walk from the skyride base. This 1600s stone watchtower allegedly once belonged to the infamous pirate himself — though historians debate whether Edward Teach ever actually set foot here. Either way, the tower offers spectacular views, and the surrounding gardens are filled with quirky sculptures and historical plaques. The climb up the famous <strong>"99 Steps"</strong> (actually 103 — go ahead and count, everyone does) from the main road is a quad-burner, but these aren't ordinary stairs. Each brick came as ballast from European sailing ships, those heavy blocks loaded in empty cargo holds to keep vessels stable as they crossed the Atlantic. When the ships arrived to take on Caribbean sugar and rum, they offloaded these bricks, and Danish colonists turned them into the stepped streets that still carry tourists three centuries later. The worn smoothness under your feet is centuries of footsteps connecting you directly to maritime history.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Lunch is lobster rolls at Mafolie Hotel's hilltop restaurant — insane views of Magens Bay from the terrace, reasonable prices, and that satisfied exhaustion of a morning well-spent. Or head downtown to Gladys' Cafe for authentic Virgin Islands cuisine (the conch in butter sauce is revelatory).</p>

      <p>Afternoon is duty-free shopping along Main Street and the side alleys — St. Thomas is famous for jewelry, watches, liquor, and perfume at prices that actually beat stateside. I stock up on rum (the $1,200 duty-free allowance for US citizens is generous) and usually grab a piece of larimar jewelry, that sky-blue stone found only in the Caribbean. No passport hassle, no currency exchange, no language barrier — just good old American vacation with palm trees.</p>

      <p>If there's still time, a sunset sail on The VI Cat or Heaven & Hell catamaran is pure magic — snorkeling, open bar, and watching the sky turn orange while the islands go silhouette. I'm always last back to the ship, sunburned shoulders and the biggest grin, already planning my next visit.</p>

    <!-- Island History -->
    <article class="card">
      <h2>Layers of History: From Ciboney Fishermen to American Territory</h2>

      <p>The story of St. Thomas reaches back thousands of years before any European set foot on these shores. Around 1500 BC, the Ciboney people — skilled fishermen and gatherers — established the island's first settlements, leaving behind stone tools and shell middens that archaeologists still uncover today. They were followed by waves of Arawak farmers who brought agriculture and pottery, and later the fierce Caribs who gave the Caribbean its name and dominated these waters when Columbus arrived.</p>

      <p>The Danish West India Company claimed St. Thomas in 1666, establishing a colony that would endure for two and a half centuries. Those narrow cobblestone streets in Charlotte Amalie still bear Danish names — Dronningens Gade (Queen's Street), Kronprindsens Gade (Crown Prince's Street), Kongens Quarter (King's Quarter) — linguistic ghosts of a colonial past that refused to fade even after American acquisition. The town itself honors Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, queen consort to Danish King Christian V, who never set foot in the Caribbean but whose name graces one of its most beautiful harbors.</p>

      <p>The wealth that built Charlotte Amalie's grand colonial architecture came at a terrible human cost. Danish plantation owners forced thousands of enslaved Africans to labor in sugar cane fields and processing mills, creating the agricultural economy that made the colony profitable. The 1848 emancipation in the Danish West Indies came only after a rebellion led by enslaved workers who had endured enough. Their courage and resistance echo through the island's culture today, from Carnival celebrations to the Creole language still spoken alongside English.</p>

      <p>In 1917, as World War I raged and German U-boats prowled the Atlantic, the United States purchased the Danish West Indies for twenty-five million dollars — about $584 million in today's currency. The strategic value of a Caribbean military foothold outweighed the hefty price tag. Denmark had been trying to sell the islands for decades, and America's security concerns finally sealed the deal. Overnight, St. Thomas transformed from Danish colony to American territory, a shift that preserved Danish street signs and architecture while introducing American currency, governance, and eventually, cruise tourism on an unprecedented scale.</p>

    <!-- Cruise Terminal Information -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Where Your Ship Docks</h3>
      <p>St. Thomas ranks among the Caribbean's most heavily visited cruise destinations, welcoming over one and a half million passengers annually through its two main terminal complexes. Your arrival point determines how you'll spend your first hour ashore.</p>

      <h4>Havensight Cruise Terminal</h4>
      <p>The primary docking facility features three dedicated berths capable of handling the largest vessels afloat. Located on the eastern edge of Charlotte Amalie harbor, Havensight sits roughly a mile from the historic downtown district. You can walk the distance in about twenty minutes along a sidewalk that parallels the waterfront, though many cruisers opt for the quick taxi ride that typically costs around five dollars per person. The terminal complex itself houses over fifty shops and restaurants, making it easy to kill time before or after your island adventures.</p>

      <h4>Crown Bay Marina & Cruise Terminal</h4>
      <p>The secondary facility on the western side of the harbor accommodates two ships simultaneously but sits roughly two miles from downtown Charlotte Amalie. Walking isn't really practical from Crown Bay, so plan on taking a taxi or arranging transportation to reach the main shopping district and historic attractions. The Crown Bay complex offers its own collection of shops and dining options if you're looking to stay close to the ship.</p>

      <h4>Tender Operations</h4>
      <p>When both terminals reach capacity during peak season, additional ships anchor in the harbor and ferry passengers ashore via tender boats. These typically deliver you directly to the downtown waterfront, which actually puts you closer to Main Street shopping than either of the main piers.</p>

      <p class="tiny" style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #678;"><strong>Note:</strong> Some cruise lines assess a per-passenger port fee of approximately five dollars (as of 2024), which appears on your onboard account rather than being collected at the gangway.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Shopping Paradise -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Shopping Paradise: Duty-Free Deals That Actually Matter</h3>
      <p>St. Thomas built its reputation as the Caribbean's premier shopping destination, and that status remains well-deserved. The combination of genuine duty-free pricing and the generous customs allowance for returning U.S. citizens creates opportunities for significant savings on luxury goods.</p>

      <h4>Main Street Charlotte Amalie</h4>
      <p>The historic downtown district packs more than four hundred retail establishments into a compact grid of narrow streets and cobblestone alleys. This is where you'll find the serious deals on jewelry, watches, designer fragrances, premium liquor, and electronics. The concentration of competing merchants helps keep prices competitive. Many stores occupy restored Danish colonial buildings that add atmosphere to your shopping expedition.</p>

      <h4>Havensight Mall</h4>
      <p>The terminal shopping complex offers the convenience of browsing without leaving the port area. With fifty-plus shops covering most of the major duty-free categories, you can knock out your shopping list in the hour before all-aboard without the taxi ride into town. Selection is more limited than downtown, but prices remain competitive on standard items.</p>

      <h4>Yacht Haven Grande</h4>
      <p>This upscale waterfront development caters to the luxury market with flagship stores from Gucci, Bulgari, Coach, and similar high-end brands. The open-air layout and marina setting make for pleasant browsing even if you're just window shopping.</p>

      <h4>What to Buy</h4>
      <p>The best values typically appear in jewelry (especially tanzanite, emeralds, and Caribbean larimar), Swiss watches, designer sunglasses, perfumes and cosmetics, and premium spirits. Electronics can offer savings but require careful price comparison since U.S. mainland sales often match or beat duty-free pricing.</p>

      <h4>The Duty-Free Advantage</h4>
      <p>U.S. citizens returning from the U.S. Virgin Islands enjoy a generous twelve-hundred-dollar duty-free exemption per person, double the standard six-hundred-dollar allowance from most other Caribbean destinations. This means a couple can bring back twenty-four hundred dollars worth of purchases without paying import duties. At least eight hundred dollars of that total must come from USVI purchases to qualify for the expanded exemption.</p>

      <h4>Store Hours</h4>
      <p>Most downtown shops operate Monday through Saturday from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon. When cruise ships remain in port on Sundays, many retailers open for business, though hours may be abbreviated. Havensight mall shops typically align their schedules with ship arrivals and departures.</p>

      <h3>Magens Bay: World-Class Sand and Surf</h3>
      <p>National Geographic didn't just stumble onto Magens Bay when assembling their list of the world's most beautiful beaches. This north-shore treasure delivers everything you imagine when picturing the perfect Caribbean beach day.</p>

      <h4>The Setting</h4>
      <p>Nearly three-quarters of a mile of powdery white sand curves gently around a heart-shaped bay flanked by lush green hillsides — and yes, it genuinely deserves its ranking among the top ten beaches in the world, a distinction National Geographic confirmed when they named it one of the most beautiful beaches on the planet. The protected configuration, with the bay cradled on three sides by palm-covered slopes, keeps the water remarkably calm even when neighboring beaches are choppy, making Magens Bay ideal for families with young children, nervous swimmers, or anyone who just wants to float peacefully without fighting waves. The water clarity rivals the finest beaches anywhere in the Caribbean, with that luminous turquoise color that photographs never quite capture accurately — you have to float in it to believe it.</p>

      <h4>Getting There</h4>
      <p>The beach sits roughly four and a half miles from the cruise terminals via a scenic mountain road that climbs over the island's central ridge before descending to the north coast. Shared safari taxis offer the most economical transportation option, with the open-air ride itself becoming part of the adventure. Figure about twenty to twenty-five minutes each way, depending on how many passengers the driver collects.</p>

      <h4>Facilities and Amenities</h4>
      <p>The beach operates as a public park with a modest entrance fee that supports maintenance and services. For that small investment, you get access to spotlessly clean restroom facilities, freshwater showers for rinsing off salt and sand, changing areas, and covered picnic pavilions perfect for escaping the midday sun. Beach chair and umbrella rentals are available at reasonable rates for the entire day — far more affordable than comparable beach clubs on other islands. A snack bar serves basic food and cold drinks throughout the day, though many visitors pack their own coolers to save money and ensure favorite snacks are available. Lifeguards patrol the swimming area during operating hours, adding peace of mind for parents and nervous swimmers.</p>

      <h4>Beyond Sunbathing</h4>
      <p>Kayak rentals allow exploration of the bay's quieter corners, while a network of nature trails winds through the surrounding Magens Bay Park for those seeking a break from beach time. The trails offer shade and occasional panoramic views of the coastline.</p>

      <p class="tiny" style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #678;"><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Arrive before ten in the morning to claim prime chair locations and experience the beach before the midday crowds roll in from the cruise ships.</p>

      <h3>Beyond the Beach: Island Highlights Worth Your Time</h3>

      <h4>Mountain Top</h4>
      <p>The island's highest accessible point delivers exactly what the name promises: sweeping panoramic views that extend across Magens Bay to neighboring islands dotting the Caribbean horizon. Perched at over fifteen hundred feet elevation, the observation deck sits at a height that makes your cruise ship look like a toy in the harbor far below. The bar claims bragging rights as the birthplace of the banana daiquiri, and whether or not that's historically accurate, the frozen concoctions they serve are legendary. The attached shopping complex offers a last chance at duty-free purchases with views that beat any mall.</p>

      <h4>Skyline Drive and Drake's Seat</h4>
      <p>This scenic roadway traces the island's mountainous spine, offering dramatic overlooks at nearly every turn. The most famous pullout is Drake's Seat, a stone bench lookout where, according to local legend, Sir Francis Drake sat and surveyed the Caribbean while plotting naval strategies. Whether the famous privateer actually used this vantage point is lost to history, but the panoramic views certainly make it plausible — you can see neighboring islands scattered across the turquoise waters like emeralds on silk. Numerous other pullouts along Skyline Drive allow photo opportunities without backing up traffic. Traveling this scenic route on your way to or from Magens Bay adds minimal time while maximizing your sightseeing efficiency.</p>

      <h4>Coral World Ocean Park</h4>
      <p>This marine park on the northeast coast combines aquarium exhibits with hands-on animal encounters and educational programs. The underwater observation tower descends fifteen feet below the surface, providing fish-eye views of Caribbean reef life without getting wet — perfect for those who want the underwater experience without the snorkel gear. Marine pools allow close-up views of stingrays, sea turtles, and tropical fish, while interactive programs offer close encounters with sea lions and other marine mammals. Nature trails wind through the property, offering elevated views of the coastline. The adjacent Coki Beach offers excellent snorkeling directly from shore, with equipment rentals available and calm, clear water perfect for spotting tropical fish.</p>

      <h4>The 99 Steps and Blackbeard's Castle</h4>
      <p>One of Charlotte Amalie's most photographed landmarks is actually a delightful mathematical lie — the famous "99 Steps" contain 103 brick stairs, but the romantic name stuck and nobody seems to mind. Built in the mid-1700s from ship ballast bricks, those heavy blocks that European sailing vessels carried to maintain stability when their cargo holds ran empty, these steps tell a story with every footfall. The bricks crossed the Atlantic in the bellies of merchant ships, were offloaded when the vessels needed to take on Caribbean sugar and rum, and ended up becoming the stepped streets that still connect the harbor to the hillside homes above. Each step you climb, worn smooth and slightly concave from three centuries of footsteps, connects you directly to that maritime past — Danish merchants, enslaved laborers, colonial governors, and now tourists all ascending the same weathered path.</p>

      <p>The stairs lead up to Blackbeard's Castle, a five-story stone watchtower built in the 1600s as a Danish military lookout named Skytsborg Tower. The pirate connection is likely legend rather than documented fact — modern historians find no evidence that the infamous Edward Teach ever set foot here, much less owned the place — but the tower certainly served as a critical defensive position for spotting approaching ships on the horizon, whether friendly traders or hostile raiders. The sweeping 360-degree harbor views from the top make it easy to understand why any self-respecting pirate would have coveted this vantage point for surveying potential targets. The surrounding gardens feature historical plaques and quirky sculptures scattered among tropical plantings, and the combination of swashbuckling pirate lore and genuine colonial Danish history makes the quad-burning climb worthwhile. Stand at the top, feeling the trade winds that guided those ships, and you're touching the same stone Danish soldiers gripped while watching for trouble three hundred years ago.</p>

      <h4>Fort Christian</h4>
      <p>The distinctive red brick fortress took fourteen years to construct (1666-1680), rising stone by stone to become the oldest standing structure in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Named for Danish King Christian V, this imposing fort served as the colony's primary defense against pirates, rival European powers, and the hurricanes that regularly swept through these waters. Over its three-and-a-half centuries of service, the versatile structure functioned as everything a frontier colony needed: church, courthouse, jail, governor's residence, military barracks, and government administrative center — a testament to the practical Danish approach to colonial architecture where one building had to serve many purposes.</p>

      <p>The small museum inside chronicles the island's richly layered history, from the Ciboney people who first settled these shores around 1500 BC and the Arawak farmers who followed them, through Danish colonial rule built on the backs of enslaved Africans, to American acquisition in 1917 when the United States paid Denmark twenty-five million dollars for strategic Caribbean territory. Standing on those weathered ramparts looking out at modern cruise ships anchored in the harbor, you're occupying the same vantage point where Danish soldiers once watched for approaching sails, never imagining their fortress would one day welcome over 1.5 million American tourists annually.</p>

      <h4>Historic Houses of Worship</h4>
      <p>Two Charlotte Amalie churches hold the distinction of being the second-oldest of their kind in the Western Hemisphere, remarkable achievements for what was once a remote colonial outpost. The St. Thomas Synagogue, built in 1833, serves a Jewish community whose roots on the island reach back to the 1600s when Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution found religious tolerance under Danish rule. The synagogue's floor is covered with sand, a tradition commemorating either the Jews' flight through the desert from Egypt or the practice of muffling footsteps during the Spanish Inquisition — historians debate which origin story holds true.</p>

      <p>Frederick Lutheran Church, built in 1793, stands as the second-oldest Lutheran congregation in the Western Hemisphere. The current Gothic Revival building replaced earlier structures destroyed by fire and hurricane, but the congregation's history stretches back to the first Danish colonists who brought their Lutheran faith to the Caribbean. Both buildings welcome visitors outside service times, offering peaceful refuges from the shopping bustle and windows into the island's rich multicultural heritage.</p>

    <!-- Practical Tips -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Essential Information for First-Time Visitors</h3>

      <h4>Currency and Money</h4>
      <p>As a United States territory, the U.S. Virgin Islands operate on American dollars exclusively. Your credit cards work exactly as they do at home, ATMs dispense familiar greenbacks, and you won't waste time or money on currency exchange. Prices are quoted in dollars, tips are calculated in dollars, and everything feels reassuringly familiar.</p>

      <h4>The Left-Side Driving Quirk</h4>
      <p>Here's where things get delightfully weird: despite being American territory where everything else feels reassuringly familiar, vehicles drive on the left side of the road following British convention. This peculiarity dates back to the Danish colonial period (they drove on the left like most of Europe at the time) and never changed after U.S. acquisition in 1917 — a case of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" that apparently applies to entire traffic systems. To make it even more confusing, most vehicles are American-made with left-side steering wheels, meaning drivers sit on the inside lane rather than the curb side, navigating blind corners with practiced nonchalance. If you're renting a car, this takes some serious adjustment and nerves of steel. As a passenger in a taxi, you'll barely notice beyond the initial moment of disorientation when you instinctively reach for a seatbelt on the wrong side.</p>

      <h4>Taxi Operations</h4>
      <p>St. Thomas taxis charge by zone rather than using meters, with published rates posted at the cruise terminals. This system prevents fare disputes but means you won't see the fare decrease if traffic moves quickly. Shared taxi rides split the cost among passengers heading to the same destination, making popular spots like Magens Bay quite affordable per person. Water taxis provide an alternative for traveling between Charlotte Amalie and various waterfront locations.</p>

      <h4>No Passport Required</h4>
      <p>American citizens need only a government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license to visit the U.S. Virgin Islands. The territory functions as a domestic destination despite the tropical setting and Caribbean culture. Your cell phone works normally without international roaming charges, and you can skip the foreign transaction fees that typically apply in other Caribbean ports.</p>

      <h4>When to Arrive Ashore</h4>
      <p>St. Thomas's popularity creates crowds — over 1.5 million cruise passengers visit annually, making this one of the Caribbean's busiest ports. When multiple mega-ships dock simultaneously (which happens frequently during peak season), popular attractions like Magens Bay and Mountain Top fill up by mid-morning with what feels like half the eastern seaboard. Getting off the ship early, ideally during the first thirty minutes after clearance, maximizes your chance of experiencing the island before the masses arrive. That quiet hour at Magens Bay before the safari taxis start rolling in is pure magic — worth setting your alarm for.</p>

      <h3>Getting Around St. Thomas</h3>
      <p>St. Thomas has two cruise piers — <strong>Havensight</strong> (closer to town) and <strong>Crown Bay</strong> (requires short taxi ride). Both areas have shopping right at the pier.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Havensight to Downtown Charlotte Amalie:</strong> 15-minute walk (about the time to properly apply sunscreen twice, or roughly three frozen daiquiri consumption sessions) or quick taxi</li>
        <li><strong>Havensight to Magens Bay:</strong> Shared safari taxi (great value, ~20 minutes — roughly the time to listen to five Jimmy Buffett songs or consume two Bushwackers responsibly)</li>
        <li><strong>Paradise Point Skyride:</strong> Walking distance from Havensight</li>
        <li><strong>Crown Bay to Downtown:</strong> 5-minute taxi</li>
        <li><strong>Fort Christian:</strong> Downtown, 5-minute walk from Main Street (about the time it takes to send three postcards or buy one duty-free watch)</li>
        <li><strong>Blackbeard's Castle:</strong> Above downtown, climb 99 Steps or taxi to top</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Safari taxis (open-air trucks) are the authentic St. Thomas experience and very affordable when shared. They run regular routes to Magens Bay and other popular spots.</p>

        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
      <p>The steep hills and open-air safari trucks are St. Thomas's way of giving you a free roller-coaster ride with million-dollar views! Wear comfortable shoes if you're exploring downtown — those historic streets are hilly. Everything is in USD, cell service works normally, and it feels remarkably like home despite the palm trees. The only "warning" is that you'll want to move here.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">No — St. Thomas is a US territory, so American citizens only need a valid ID. It's like visiting Hawaii, just with better beaches. US dollars everywhere, your cell phone works, and you can bring back $1,200 in duty-free goods.</p>
      </details>

        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What's the best beach?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Magens Bay is consistently rated top-10 in the world — calm, clear, protected water with excellent facilities. Small entrance fee is worth it. For a closer option, Coki Beach near Coral World has great snorkeling but can get crowded.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Paradise Point at the top of the skyride is legendary. Mountain Top (highest point on island) claims to have invented the Bushwacker's cousin, the Banana Daiquiri. Both are worth the trip for the views alone.</p>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is the duty-free shopping actually good?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — liquor, jewelry (especially tanzanite and larimar), watches, and perfume are genuinely discounted. US citizens can bring back $1,200 duty-free. Main Street and side alleys have the best selection. Compare prices before you buy.</p>
