        <h1>Dakar: Where Africa Meets the Atlantic</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Dakar sits at the westernmost point of the African continent, jutting into the Atlantic like a fist raised in defiance or greeting — I could never quite decide which. The Cape Verde Peninsula feels like the edge of something, the place where land runs out of options and decides to make peace with the sea. Approaching by ship, the African Renaissance Monument rises 160 feet above the harbor, a bronze colossus larger than the Statue of Liberty, controversial and impossible to ignore, announcing that this city has things to say about its future.</p>

          <p>The capital of Senegal pulses with an energy that's distinctly West African — chaotic and musical, crowded and welcoming all at once. French colonial architecture crumbles gracefully next to modern high-rises. Street vendors sell grilled corn and plastic toys from carts painted in primary colors. Taxi rapides (minibuses) painted in wild yellows and blues weave through traffic with entrepreneurial urgency. And everywhere, everywhere, you encounter teranga — the Wolof word for hospitality that Senegalese people treat not as a nicety but as a sacred duty.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in the Door of No Return at the House of Slaves on Gorée Island. That narrow opening frames the Atlantic — the same view that millions saw as their last glimpse of home before being forced onto ships. A French tour guide, voice breaking, explained that families were separated here, children torn from mothers in this very room. The silence among our group was absolute. Some wept. I thought about how tourism can trivialize history, but also how bearing witness is an act of remembrance. We owe the dead at least that much: to see, to feel, to never forget.
          </div>

          <p>But Dakar isn't only its painful history. It's also the Pink Lake (Lac Retba) that turns rose-colored from salt-loving algae, where women in waist-deep water harvest salt with their bare hands and load it onto pirogues. It's the Grand Mosque where the call to prayer echoes across the Plateau district five times daily. It's Sandaga Market where fabric vendors sell wax prints in patterns so vibrant they seem to vibrate, and where you can bargain for everything from calabash bowls to leather slippers while drinking bissap (hibiscus tea) the color of garnets.</p>

          <p>This is a city that straddles worlds — African and French, traditional and modern, past and future. It doesn't resolve these tensions so much as live inside them with a shrug and a smile. That might be the most honest approach any of us can take.</p>

            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Port of Dakar — major commercial port with basic cruise facilities; taxi stand at gate</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> Downtown Plateau district 10-15 min taxi; Gorée Island ferry terminal 15 min taxi</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> West African CFA Franc (XOF); ATMs available; euros sometimes accepted; credit cards limited</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> French (official), Wolof widely spoken; English limited outside tourist areas</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; chaotic traffic; taxis abundant and recommended over rental cars</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> November-May (dry season); June-October rainy with high humidity; December-February coolest</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Gorée Island</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage site 3 km offshore — House of Slaves (Maison des Esclaves) with Door of No Return, IFAN Museum, colonial architecture, car-free streets. Ferry from Dakar port 5,000 CFA (~$8) round-trip, 20 minutes, hourly departures. Profoundly moving slave trade memorial. Allow minimum 3-4 hours. Bring water, tissues, quiet respect.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">African Renaissance Monument</h4>
          <p>Controversial 160-foot bronze statue on twin hills — taller than Statue of Liberty or Christ the Redeemer. Family group gazing toward Atlantic represents African rebirth. Built 2010 by North Korea (yes, really). Elevator to top offers panoramic Dakar views. 3,000 CFA entry. 20 min from port. Impressive regardless of artistic opinions.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Lac Rose (Pink Lake)</h4>
          <p>Retba Lake northeast of Dakar turns pink from Dunaliella salina algae and high salt content (40% — saltier than Dead Sea). Women harvest salt by hand. Former Paris-Dakar Rally finish line. Quad biking on dunes available. 1-hour drive from port. Tours ~$40-60. Surreal natural phenomenon worth the journey.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sandaga Market & Kermel Market</h4>
          <p>Sandaga: Sprawling three-story labyrinth selling fabric, art, leather, spices, everything. Overwhelming, authentic, requires bargaining skills. Kermel: Smaller covered market near Place de l'Indépendance with produce, fish, crafts. Both vibrant African market experiences. Watch belongings. Bring small bills. Morning less crowded.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Grand Mosque of Dakar</h4>
          <p>Central mosque with green-tiled roof and tall minaret dominating Plateau district skyline. Built 1964 post-independence. Non-Muslims welcome outside prayer times with modest dress and respect. Beautiful geometric tilework. Free (donations welcome). Adjacent to Presidential Palace. 15-minute visit adds cultural context.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">IFAN Museum of African Arts</h4>
          <p>Fundamental Institute of Black Africa — West African masks, instruments, textiles, religious objects. One of West Africa's finest ethnographic collections. Located on Gorée Island or main branch near Place de l'Indépendance. 3,000 CFA. Well-curated introduction to regional cultures. 1-2 hours.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Yellow taxis abundant at port. Agree on fare before departure (no meters). Expect 5,000-10,000 CFA for city rides. Uber/Yango available with smartphone.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rapides:</strong> Colorful shared minibuses — authentic but confusing for tourists. Routes unclear, no fixed stops. For adventurous travelers only.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry:</strong> Gorée Island ferry from terminal near downtown. Departures hourly 6am-midnight. 5,000 CFA round-trip. Can get crowded; go early morning.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Plateau district walkable but hot. Sidewalks uneven. Watch traffic. Markets require stamina and alertness for pickpockets.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Recommended for Pink Lake, African Renaissance Monument. Book through ship or reputable local agencies. Saves negotiation hassle.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Thieboudienne:</strong> National dish — red rice cooked with fish, tomato paste, vegetables. Senegalese soul food. Every restaurant serves it. Pronunciation: "cheb-oo-jen."</li>
            <li><strong>Yassa Poulet:</strong> Chicken marinated in lemon and onions, grilled and simmered. Tangy, rich, served over rice. Comfort food that delivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Mafe:</strong> Peanut stew with lamb or chicken, sweet potatoes, vegetables. Thick, hearty, distinctly West African. Served with rice or couscous.</li>
            <li><strong>Dibi:</strong> Grilled lamb seasoned with mustard and spices. Street food favorite. Order at outdoor dibi stands with bread and onions.</li>
            <li><strong>Bissap:</strong> Hibiscus flower drink — tart, refreshing, deep red color. Served cold. Also called "Senegalese champagne." Non-alcoholic.</li>
            <li><strong>Café Touba:</strong> Senegalese spiced coffee with cloves and guinea pepper. Strong, sweet, distinctive. Morning ritual across the country.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Fruit:</strong> Mangoes, papaya, bissap fruit at markets. Sweetness confirms you're in the tropics.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Gorée Island is essential — don't skip it. Go early morning before crowds. House of Slaves opens 10:30am. Emotionally heavy; prepare accordingly.</li>
            <li>Bargaining expected at markets — start at 40-50% of asking price. Smile, be patient, walk away if needed. It's a dance, not combat.</li>
            <li>French phrases help enormously. "Bonjour," "merci," "combien?" open doors. Wolof "Nanga def?" (How are you?) delights locals.</li>
            <li>Dress modestly (shoulders/knees covered) out of respect. Senegal is 95% Muslim. Mosques require extra modesty and scarf for women.</li>
            <li>Bring small bills — 1,000 and 5,000 CFA notes. Change scarce. ATMs at port or downtown banks. Credit cards rarely accepted.</li>
            <li>Pink Lake best mid-dry season (Dec-May) when pink color most vibrant. Rainy season dilutes salt concentration and color fades.</li>
            <li>Watch belongings in markets — pickpockets skilled and patient. Money belt or cross-body bag essential. Don't carry valuables.</li>
            <li>Heat intense year-round. Bring water, sunscreen, hat. Dehydration sneaks up. Pace yourself.</li>
            <li>Teranga is real — Senegalese hospitality legendary. Return warmth with respect. Accept tea invitations if time allows; it's cultural bridge-building.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Port of Dakar on Cape Verde Peninsula. Taxis available at port gate to city center (10-15 min) or Gorée ferry terminal (15 min).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Gorée Island worth visiting?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely yes. UNESCO World Heritage site with profound slave trade history. House of Slaves and Door of No Return are emotionally powerful. Essential for understanding transatlantic slavery. Allow 3-4 hours minimum.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br/>A: West African CFA Franc (XOF). ATMs available in Dakar. Euros sometimes accepted but poor exchange rates. US dollars less useful. Bring cash — credit cards rarely work.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Dakar safe for tourists?</strong><br/>A: Generally safe with normal precautions. Pickpocketing common in markets. Avoid displaying valuables. Stick to main areas during daylight. Teranga hospitality means locals often help lost tourists.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Do I need French to visit?</strong><br/>A: Helpful but not essential. Basic phrases go far. Markets and taxis require French or Wolof. Tour guides and hotel staff often speak English. Translation app recommended.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I see the Pink Lake in a half-day?</strong><br/>A: Tight but possible. Pink Lake 45-60 min from port (1 hour each way = 2 hours travel). Need 1-2 hours at lake. Half-day tours available. Full-day more relaxed.</p>
