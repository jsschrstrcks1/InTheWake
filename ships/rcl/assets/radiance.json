Floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere meant we were rarely far from the scenery.\n\n## Crew & Flow\nEmbarkation was smooth, dining teams learned our preferences fast, and the Solarium became our afternoon retreat between ports.\n\n## Dining\n**Main Dining Room** handled classics well; **Giovanni’s** for a romantic splurge; **Izumi** for a lighter night. Windjammer breakfasts were quick and painless.\n\n## Entertainment\nClassics in the theater, lively pub music, and trivia that turned strangers into teammates.\n\n## Ports\nJuneau, Ketchikan, Icy Strait Point — easy gangways and well-timed all-aboards made days ashore relaxed.\n\n## Closing\nRadiance feels purpose-built for scenery cruising. If you love windows, you’ll love this ship."
