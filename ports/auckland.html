      <!-- Quick Answer -->
      <section class="quick-answer" style="background:#e6f7f5;border-left:5px solid #2a9d8f;padding:1rem 1.25rem;margin:1.5rem 0;border-radius:8px;">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Quick&nbsp;Answer:</strong> New Zealand ports consistently score 4.9–5.0 stars for natural beauty and friendliness. Auckland must-dos: Sky Tower, Waiheke Island wine tour, America's Cup sailing. Bay of Islands: Hole in the Rock dolphin cruise and Waitangi Treaty Grounds.</p>

        <h2>My New Zealand Day – A First-Person Account</h2>
        <p>Sailing into Auckland under the Harbour Bridge with Rangitoto volcano rising perfectly symmetrical in the background is pure postcard magic, and New Zealand ports consistently top the charts for natural beauty and friendliness (4.9–5.0 average 2023–2025).</p>

        <p>In Auckland my perfect day starts the moment we dock: I'm off the ship and straight up Queen Street to the Sky Tower for 360° views, then a 12-minute ferry to Devonport for Victorian villas and beaches. Waiheke Island is next – the 35-minute fast ferry and then a wine tour of Mudbrick, Stonyridge, and Cable Bay with their world-class Syrah and those insane ocean views. Lunch is always green-lipped mussels and fish & chips on the beach at Oneroa.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Sitting on Mudbrick's terrace with a glass of Syrah, looking out over the Hauraki Gulf as the sun dips toward Auckland's skyline – every "kia ora" and "sweet as" from the staff makes me feel less like a tourist and more like I've finally found the family I didn't know I was looking for.
        </div>

        <p>Back in the city, Viaduct Harbour for craft beer, the War Memorial Museum (the Māori cultural performance is spine-tingling), and a sunset sail on an America's Cup yacht.</p>

        <p>Up in the Bay of Islands (Waitangi/Paihia tender port) it's all about the Hole in the Rock dolphin cruise, the Waitangi Treaty Grounds (where New Zealand was born), and swimming with dolphins or kayaking to hidden coves. The Bay of Islands feels like the Mediterranean but with glowworms and kauri forests.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Auckland's <strong>Queens Wharf</strong> or <strong>Princes Wharf</strong> puts you literally in the heart of downtown – step off and you're on the waterfront promenade. Bay of Islands is a scenic tender to Paihia or Waitangi – everything is right there or a short shuttle.</p>

      <!-- Word of Warning -->
      <section style="background:#fef9e7;border-left:5px solid #f4d03f;padding:1rem 1.25rem;margin:1.5rem 0;border-radius:8px;">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>A Positively Worded Word of Warning:</strong> The famous Kiwi friendliness and "no worries" attitude are contagious – slow down, chat with a local, and let New Zealand time turn your day into the most relaxed, smile-filled memory of the cruise.</p>
