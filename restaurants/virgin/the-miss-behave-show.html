      <h3>The Miss Behave Show Review: Controlled Chaos That Never Gets Old</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Miss Behave Show is an interactive game show created by Amy Saunders — a high-energy, audience-participation experience where guests win and lose points in a show that is literally never the same twice. Performed in The Red Room or other intimate venues, Miss Behave (the character) cajoles, challenges, and entertains the audience through a rapid-fire series of games, dares, and comedic bits that rely entirely on who happens to be in the room. It is included in the fare and runs multiple times per voyage. This is the show that generates the most post-cruise social media buzz.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>Drinks are available from the venue bar before the show. The espresso martini and champagne are common pre-show orders. Bar Tab applies. Crucially, you will want a drink in hand before this show starts — once Miss Behave takes the stage, leaving your seat is almost impossible (and she may call you out for it). Where it falls short: no in-show drink service, and the pre-show bar can get congested. The drink selection is standard venue fare with no themed options. Order early and order generously — the show runs 45-60 minutes and you will not want to interrupt it.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Amy Saunders (or the performer playing Miss Behave) is genuinely one of the most talented entertainers on any cruise line. The character is sharp, spontaneous, and fearless — pulling audience members into games, roasting volunteers with affection, and building genuine moments of hilarity from crowd participation. The show's genius is its unpredictability: every performance is shaped by the specific audience, which means repeat viewings remain fresh. The performer reads the room expertly — adjusting the humor, intensity, and participation level based on the crowd's energy. The production team supports the chaos smoothly behind the scenes.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The energy in the room during a Miss Behave Show is electric — the audience is active, engaged, and frequently in tears of laughter. The intimate venue size means there is no hiding in the back (though sitting further back reduces your chances of being pulled on stage). The adults-only audience enables humor that is sharper and more risque than what you would find on a family cruise line. The competitive game-show format creates genuine stakes and invested cheering. Where it falls short: if you are deeply uncomfortable with audience participation or being singled out, this show can feel stressful rather than fun. Miss Behave is persistent and entertaining, but introverted guests may find the pressure unwelcome. The show can also vary in quality depending on the specific performer — when Amy Saunders performs personally, the show is exceptional; understudy performances can be good but inconsistent.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.9/5.</strong> The Miss Behave Show is one of the most unique and consistently entertaining experiences on Virgin Voyages — genuinely funny, deeply interactive, and different every time. The performer's ability to improvise with the crowd creates moments that cannot be replicated. It falls short for introverts who dislike audience participation, can vary by performer, and the lack of in-show drink service is inconvenient. <em>Tip:</em> sit in the front three rows if you want to be part of the action, or sit in the back corner if you prefer to watch safely. See it twice — the second time is often funnier because you understand the format and can focus on the improvisation.</p>
