My first-person logbook entry will be added after I sail.\n\n## Intro\nBoarding at Port Canaveral with kids, grandparents, and a carry-on stuffed with chargers and snacks felt like herding cats through the atrium — until we stepped into Adventure of the Seas and the chaos turned to awe. Our multigenerational crew (teens, a grade-schooler, a toddler, and grandpa in a wheelchair) found a floating playground where every age got a win. **Price check (our price):** Inside came in around **~$759 pp**, and a Balcony for extended family closer to **~$1,079 pp** → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\n\n*Book your family’s Adventure of the Seas* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=top-cta\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrom day one, bartenders remembered our sodas and lemonades, and room stewards learned nap schedules so the toddler could crash without the vacuum cameo. Porters handled the big bags landside; we rolled aboard light and happy. The way staff anticipated wheelchair moments — opening doors, guiding us to elevators without fuss — made the ship feel like it was designed for us. Smiles in the salty breeze, names learned fast, and patience that never ran dry.\n\n## Shows and Entertainment\nStudio B’s ice show had our teens filming spins like sports highlights; “Can’t Stop the Rock” turned the theater into a sing-along. I face-planted on the FlowRider and got a sticky-soft-serve high-five from the nine-year-old next door. Arcade duels, promenade parades, and late-night pub singalongs meant somebody was always declaring it the *best day ever*.\n\n## Dining\nWindjammer was our varsity buffet — tacos, salads, and kid-approved pasta — while **Chops Grille** delivered the “whoa” steaks. **Giovanni’s Table** became nonna-energy comfort. The Main Dining Room handled our one nut allergy cleanly, no drama. *Packing sanity saver:* our family list that kept cords, meds, and sippy-cup lids in line → /packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-dining\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nThe Royal app smoothed the whole thing — photos, docs, arrival time — and we were boarding smiles-first. In ports like Aruba and Curaçao we **walked down the gangway** straight into color-splashed streets.\n\n## The Real Talk\nSea-day loungers fill early, and Wi-Fi can slow **far out to sea/peak usage**. Nothing show-stopping; it nudged us outside together.\n\n## Accessible Seas on Adventure of the Seas\nElevators placed sensibly, theater companion seating, pool lifts ready when asked. One afternoon a crew member gently parked us near a hard-surface route so grandpa’s chair rolled easier. It wasn’t about special treatment — it was about dignity.\n- **Elevator access** to all public decks → /disability-at-sea.html\n- **Pool/whirlpool lifts** on request\n- **Accessible staterooms** with roll-in showers → /ships/rcl/adventure-of-the-seas.html#accessible\n- **Priority tendering** where applicable (most calls here were at a pier)\n\n## A Female Perspective\nI felt respected everywhere — from the spa to late-night walks on the promenade. *Bring a light scarf*; the theater runs cool. Formal night ranged from glammed-up gowns to simple chic; no one stared either way. Making friends came easy in line for cappuccinos; the crew never made safety an afterthought.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nFrom toddler giggles to grandpa’s big-band sway, our week stitched together memories in every salty gust. *Summer dates go first — book now* → https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-search?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=bottom-cta  | *Packing list we actually used* → /packing-lists.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ship-review&utm_content=packing-bottom\n\n---\n**Header image:** CC-BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons",
