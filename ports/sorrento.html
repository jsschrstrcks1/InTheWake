        <h1>Sorrento: Where Lemons Meet the Sea</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The scent hits you before you see anything — citrus and salt air, the signature perfume of Sorrento. This clifftop town dangles 50 meters above the Tyrrhenian Sea, terraced lemon groves cascading down volcanic rock toward water so blue it looks painted. Roman emperors built their villas here. Two thousand years later, I understand why. This stretch of coastline doesn't just look beautiful; it feels like the Mediterranean distilled to its essence — sunlight, stone, sea, and citrus.</p>

          <p>Sorrento itself is a gateway, and what a collection of destinations it guards. To the east, Pompeii sleeps under the shadow of Vesuvius, frozen in ash for two millennia. To the south, the Amalfi Coast twists along cliffs so dramatic that the road engineers who carved SS163 deserve medals for bravery. To the west, Capri rises from the sea like a limestone fortress, twenty minutes by ferry and worlds away in glamour. And here in Sorrento proper, the old town hums with the gentle rhythm of a place that's been greeting travelers since before cruise ships existed.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in Pompeii's Forum, staring up at Mount Vesuvius, the mountain that ended this city in a single day. The ruts worn into stone streets by Roman chariot wheels. The bakery with loaves still in the oven. The villa frescoes painted in colors that shouldn't still be this vivid. History doesn't feel abstract when you're walking through someone's 2,000-year-old kitchen. Time collapsed. I felt very small and very grateful that Vesuvius chose a different day.
          </div>

          <p>The cloisters of San Francesco offer a different kind of sanctuary — 14th-century arches, bougainvillea spilling over ancient stone, silence in the middle of a busy town. Piazza Tasso pulses with aperitivo culture, outdoor cafes, and street performers. And everywhere, limoncello — the sweet, tart, slightly dangerous lemon liqueur made from Sorrento's famous citrus groves. They'll let you taste it in every shop. Pace yourself.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Marina Piccola (small ships) or Naples port (most large cruise ships with Sorrento shore excursions)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> If docked at Marina Piccola, elevador (funicular) connects marina to town center; Naples port ~50km (1 hour by bus/train)</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Depends on ship size — small ships may dock at Marina Piccola; large ships dock in Naples</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (EUR); ATMs throughout Sorrento town center</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Italian (English widely spoken in tourist areas)</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; SS163 Amalfi Coast road is spectacularly beautiful and spectacularly winding</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> April-May and September-October (warm, less crowded); June-August busiest and hottest</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pompeii Archaeological Site</h4>
          <p>Walk 2,000-year-old Roman streets frozen in time by Vesuvius eruption (79 AD). Forum, amphitheater, villas with intact frescoes, bakeries, baths — entire city preserved in volcanic ash. Bring passport/ID for entry (required). Wear comfortable shoes, bring water. Half-day minimum, full-day ideal. Summer heat intense — early morning best. This is why you came to Italy.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Positano — Jewel of the Amalfi Coast</h4>
          <p>Cliffside village tumbling toward the sea in cascades of pastel houses, bougainvillea, and narrow staircases. Boutique shopping, beach clubs, impossibly scenic views. 45 minutes from Sorrento via SS163 coastal road. Expect winding curves and tour buses. Park above and walk down (easier than climbing back up). Half-day browsing shops and beach. Bring camera and comfortable walking shoes for steep paths.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Amalfi Town</h4>
          <p>Historic Maritime Republic, 13th-century Duomo with Byzantine mosaics, narrow streets lined with lemon shops and ceramics. Less vertical than Positano, more historic weight. 1 hour from Sorrento on coastal road. Climb the cathedral steps, explore the cloister, taste sfusato amalfitano lemons (they're enormous). Half-day visit. Pair with Ravello or Positano for full-day Amalfi Coast tour.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Capri &amp; the Blue Grotto</h4>
          <p>20-minute fast ferry from Sorrento to Capri island. Blue Grotto sea cave glows electric blue (weather permitting; small boats required, can be choppy). Capri town's glamorous piazzetta, designer shopping, funicular to Anacapri. Villa Jovis (Tiberius' imperial villa), Gardens of Augustus. Full-day recommended. Ferry tickets ~€20-40 roundtrip. Blue Grotto separate fee (~€15). Book early in summer.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Sorrento Old Town</h4>
          <p>Cloister of San Francesco (14th century) — peaceful arches and gardens, often hosts concerts/weddings. Piazza Tasso — main square with cafes and street life. Limoncello tasting in family-run shops. Via San Cesareo for shopping (inlaid wood, ceramics, lemon products). Marina Grande fishing village below cliffs. Easy walking. 2-3 hours exploring, or linger over long lunch.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ravello</h4>
          <p>Hilltop town above Amalfi, 365 meters elevation, stunning panoramic views of coastline. Villa Rufolo gardens (13th century) with terraced beauty and summer concerts. Villa Cimbrone with Terrace of Infinity overlooking cliffs. Quieter, more refined than coastal towns. 1.5 hours from Sorrento. Half-day visit. Popular with honeymooners and classical music lovers. Bring layers — cooler at elevation.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Sorrento town center compact and walkable. Elevador connects Marina Piccola to town. Some steep streets and stairs — good shoes essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available but negotiate fixed price before departure. Expect €50-80 for Pompeii, €80-120 for Positano/Amalfi day trip. Meter not always used.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Driver:</strong> Popular option for Amalfi Coast tours (€200-300 for half-day). Driver navigates SS163 hairpin turns while you enjoy views.</li>
            <li><strong>Bus:</strong> SITA buses run Sorrento-Positano-Amalfi route on SS163. Cheap (~€5) but crowded in summer. Prepare for dramatic coastal curves.</li>
            <li><strong>Train:</strong> Circumvesuviana train connects Sorrento-Pompeii-Naples. ~€3-5, 30 min to Pompeii. Functional but basic; watch belongings.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry:</strong> Fast ferries to Capri (20 min, ~€20-40 roundtrip). Also connect to Positano, Amalfi (seasonal). Scenic and avoids coastal road traffic.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food &amp; Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Limoncello:</strong> Sweet lemon liqueur made from Sorrento's prized sfusato lemons. Served ice-cold after meals. Tasting shops everywhere — family recipes vary widely in quality and sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Gnocchi alla Sorrentina:</strong> Potato dumplings baked with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Comfort food perfection. Nearly every restaurant serves their version.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Grilled fish, spaghetti alle vongole (clams), fritto misto. Restaurants at Marina Grande specialize. Amalfi Coast herbs and lemon finish everything.</li>
            <li><strong>Delizia al Limone:</strong> Lemon cream cake — sponge soaked in limoncello, filled with lemon cream, covered in lemon glaze. Dangerously good. Every pasticceria makes one.</li>
            <li><strong>Mozzarella di Bufala:</strong> Buffalo mozzarella from nearby Campania dairies. Creamy, fresh, often served with tomatoes and basil (Caprese salad). Simple and perfect.</li>
            <li><strong>Pizza:</strong> This is Campania — birthplace of pizza. Thin crust, wood-fired, minimalist toppings. Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil) shows quality. Simple test of excellence.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Pompeii entrance requires passport or photo ID — bring it. Site is enormous and exposed; wear sun protection and bring water.</li>
            <li>SS163 Amalfi Coast road is breathtaking but winding. If prone to motion sickness, sit on right side of bus (sea views) and take medication before departure.</li>
            <li>Capri ferry schedules change with weather. Blue Grotto closes frequently for rough seas. Morning departures generally calmer. Check conditions before committing.</li>
            <li>Limoncello quality varies wildly. Ask to taste before buying. Artisanal shops use traditional recipes; tourist traps use shortcuts. You'll taste the difference.</li>
            <li>Sorrento hosts Grape Festival (September), Sardine Festival (June), and Sausage Festival (February) — if timing aligns, these celebrate local food culture authentically.</li>
            <li>Villa Rufolo in Ravello hosts classical music concerts in summer gardens — magical setting. Check schedule if interested; book ahead.</li>
            <li>Many shops close 1-4pm for riposo (afternoon rest). Plan morning shopping or wait until late afternoon. Restaurants serve lunch 12:30-3pm, dinner 7pm onward.</li>
            <li>ATMs plentiful in Sorrento. Many small shops and market stalls prefer cash. Restaurants and hotels accept cards.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Most large ships dock in Naples and offer Sorrento shore excursions. Smaller ships may dock at Sorrento's Marina Piccola, connected to town by elevador (funicular).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Do I need my passport for Pompeii?</strong><br/>A: Yes. Archaeological site requires passport or valid photo ID for entry. Bring it.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I visit Capri from Sorrento in one day?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. Fast ferries run every 30-60 minutes, 20-minute crossing. You can do half-day trip or full-day exploration. Blue Grotto weather-dependent.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What's the best way to see the Amalfi Coast?</strong><br/>A: Hire a private driver for stress-free experience on winding SS163 road (€200-300 half-day). SITA buses are cheap but crowded. Organized shore excursions handle logistics.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is one day enough for Sorrento and surroundings?</strong><br/>A: Not really — this area deserves a week. In one day, choose: Pompeii + Sorrento town, OR Positano/Amalfi Coast tour, OR Capri island. Don't try to do everything; you'll spend the day in transit.</p>
