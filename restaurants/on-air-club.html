    <p class="subtitle">Royal Caribbean — Recording Studio Karaoke</p>

    <p class="answer-line"><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> On Air Club is Royal Caribbean's innovative recording studio-themed karaoke venue exclusive to Quantum Class ships. Beyond traditional karaoke, it features private recording booths where you and your friends can record your own music video with professional lighting, sound, and green screen effects — then take home the recording. All complimentary.</p>

    <p class="fit-guidance"><strong>Best For:</strong> Groups of friends, families creating memories, anyone who's dreamed of recording a music video, karaoke enthusiasts looking for something different.</p>

    <div class="key-facts">
      <h3>Key Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> Complimentary (drinks at bar extra)</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> SeaPlex area, Deck 15</li>
        <li><strong>Recording Booths:</strong> Private rooms for music video creation</li>
        <li><strong>Take Home:</strong> Download or email your music video</li>

    </div>

    <p class="lede">Because regular karaoke wasn't innovative enough for Royal Caribbean.</p>
    <p class="blurb">On Air Club takes the cruise karaoke experience to another level. Sure, you can do traditional karaoke in the main lounge area. But the real draw is the private recording booths where your group becomes the stars of your own music video. The technology handles everything — lighting, camera work, special effects — so you just focus on the performance. It's a unique souvenir that captures the fun of your cruise. <a href="/restaurants.html">Return to the Restaurants & Venues hub →</a></p>

      <h3>On Air Club Review: We Made a Music Video</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Our group of four had one goal: make an unforgettable music video of "Bohemian Rhapsody." On Air Club delivered beyond expectations.</p>

      <h4>The Process</h4>
      <p>We signed up on the app and got a 9 PM booth slot. The venue has a cool recording studio vibe — think vinyl record décor, neon lights, and professional equipment. When our time came, staff walked us through the setup: choose your song, pick a background effect, and get positioned.</p>

      <h4>The Recording</h4>
      <p>The booth was surprisingly professional. Multiple cameras automatically switched angles during our performance. The green screen let us choose a "rock concert" background. The sound was great through headphones, lyrics displayed clearly, and we could see ourselves on screen. We committed fully — head banging during the guitar solo, dramatic poses during "Mama, just killed a man."</p>

      <h4>The Result</h4>
      <p>The finished video looked legitimately good. The automatic editing added transitions and effects that made it feel like an actual music video. We downloaded it immediately and have watched it approximately 47 times since. It's the perfect cruise souvenir — way better than another magnet.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.4/5.</strong> On Air Club is a genuinely innovative addition to cruise entertainment. The recording booth experience is unique and creates lasting memories. Highly recommend for groups of friends or families wanting something different. Book early — slots fill up.</p>
