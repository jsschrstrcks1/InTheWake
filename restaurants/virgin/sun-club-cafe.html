      <h3>Sun Club Cafe Review: Solid Poolside Bites Above the Usual Standard</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Sun Club Cafe is Virgin Voyages' casual outdoor dining spot — a walk-up counter and seating area serving tacos, salads, grain bowls, and lighter fare alongside the pool deck. It fills the role that a buffet plays on other cruise lines, but in a more curated, counter-service format. All food is complimentary (included in fare). It is one of the most-visited venues on sea days simply because it is outdoors, quick, and requires no reservation. Open for lunch and afternoon snacking.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The fish tacos are the standout — crispy battered fish, tangy slaw, a proper lime crema, and a soft corn tortilla that does not fall apart. The chicken shawarma bowl with hummus and pickled vegetables is another strong pick — fresh, flavorful, and a refreshing alternative to heavier cruise food. The grain bowl with roasted vegetables is satisfying for plant-based guests. The nachos are loaded and crowd-pleasing. Where it falls short: the menu is limited (8-10 items) and does not change during the voyage. By day five, you have eaten everything. The burgers are outclassed by what The Galley serves. The fries are inconsistent — sometimes crispy, sometimes limp. The salads are fresh but basic. This is elevated pool food, not a restaurant — adjust expectations accordingly.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Counter service is quick and efficient — order at the window, grab a number, and your food arrives at your table in 5-10 minutes. The crew working the counter are cheerful and handle the lunchtime rush well. No table service means you bus your own trays, which is fine for the casual setting. The ordering process is straightforward and the line moves fast even when busy.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Open-air, poolside, and casual — exactly what you want for a midday meal in the sun. The seating area offers both covered and uncovered options. The vibe is relaxed and vacation-mode appropriate. Music from the pool deck DJ provides background energy. Where it falls short: the seating fills up quickly on sea days, and finding a table during peak lunch (noon-1 PM) can require patience. The area is exposed to wind, which can blow napkins and lighter items around. The proximity to the pool means the area gets wet from splashing.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.7/5.</strong> Sun Club Cafe is a reliable casual dining option that exceeds typical cruise ship poolside food — the fish tacos and shawarma bowl are genuinely good, and the counter-service format keeps things quick. It falls short on menu variety (too limited for a full voyage), consistency (fries and burgers are hit-or-miss), and seating availability on busy days. <em>Tip:</em> go at 11:30 AM before the lunch rush — shorter lines, more seating, and the food is freshest from the first batch of the day.</p>
