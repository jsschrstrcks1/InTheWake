                From the ship's upper deck, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta
                seemed like a geological impossibility—snow-capped peaks rising
                directly from tropical jungle to 5,775 meters, the world's
                highest coastal mountain, close enough that I felt I could sail
                directly into the clouds. The indigenous Kogi people who live
                in those heights consider themselves the "Elder Brothers" of
                humanity, guardians of the world's ecological balance. Looking
                at those peaks from sea level, it was easy to believe they might
                know something the rest of us have forgotten.

                In the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino, the hacienda where
                Simón Bolívar died in 1830, I stood in the small bedroom where
                South America's great liberator took his final breath at age
                47, defeated not by Spanish armies but by tuberculosis and
                political betrayal. "I have plowed the sea," he reportedly said
                at the end. The window looks toward the Sierra Nevada. I
                wondered if he found any peace in those eternal mountains.

            <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
            <p>
              Santa Marta's Marina Internacional handles cruise ship visits. The
              modern marina can accommodate most cruise ships dockside, though
              larger vessels may anchor and tender. The marina area is
              well-developed with restaurants, shops, and taxi stands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The historic center (Centro Histórico) is about 15 minutes on foot
              from the marina along the waterfront. The walk passes Taganga
              fishing village viewpoints and the city's beaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Colombia's oldest city (founded 1525), Santa Marta offers
              authentic Latin American culture beyond the typical Caribbean
              cruise port experience. This is a real working city, not a tourist
              construct.

          <section class="port-section" id="attractions">
            <h2>Top Attractions</h2>

            <h3>Historic Center (Centro Histórico)</h3>
            <p>
              Santa Marta's compact colonial center features the Cathedral
              Basílica (where Bolívar's remains were held before transfer to
              Caracas), the Casa de la Aduana museum, and pleasant plazas with
              cafés. Parque de los Novios is the social center—ideal for
              people-watching with a coffee or beer.
            </p>

            <h3>Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino</h3>
            <p>
              The sugar hacienda where Simón Bolívar died is now a museum and
              botanical garden. The colonial mansion, Bolívar memorial, and
              peaceful grounds offer insight into both the Liberator's final
              days and regional history. About 15 minutes by taxi from the
              marina.
            </p>

            <h3>Tayrona National Park</h3>
            <p>
              One of Colombia's premier natural destinations, Tayrona protects
              jungle-backed Caribbean beaches and ancient indigenous ruins. The
              park entrance is 45 minutes from Santa Marta; reaching the famous
              beaches (Cabo San Juan, Arrecifes) requires additional hiking.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cruise Day Reality:</strong> A meaningful Tayrona visit
              requires 6-8 hours minimum. Book ship excursions or arrange
              private transport for early departure. Some tours visit
              Playa Cristal or other closer beaches as alternatives.
            </p>

            <h3>El Rodadero Beach</h3>
            <p>
              The most developed beach near Santa Marta, El Rodadero offers
              calm water, restaurants, and watersports. About 10 minutes by
              taxi from the marina. More accessible than Tayrona for those with
              limited time.
            </p>

            <h3>Taganga</h3>
            <p>
              This fishing village 5km from Santa Marta has a relaxed backpacker
              vibe, dive shops, and seafood restaurants. The beach is rocky but
              the atmosphere authentic. Good for a half-day exploration.
            </p>

          <section class="port-section" id="sierra-nevada">
            <h2>The Sierra Nevada</h2>
            <p>
              The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is the world's highest coastal
              mountain range. Rising from sea level to 5,775 meters (18,947
              feet) in just 42 kilometers, it contains every climate zone from
              tropical beach to permanent snow. Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico
              Simón Bolívar, the twin highest peaks, are often hidden in clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indigenous communities (Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, Kankuamo) maintain
              traditional lifestyles in the highlands. Some tours offer
              respectful cultural encounters, though deep-mountain visits
              require multi-day treks beyond cruise ship timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even from the city, the mountain backdrop transforms Santa Marta
              from ordinary to extraordinary. On clear mornings, the peaks glow
              pink at sunrise.
            </p>

          <section class="port-section" id="food">
            <h2>Colombian Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
              Santa Marta's location on the Caribbean coast means excellent
              seafood fused with traditional Colombian flavors.
            </p>
            <h3>Local Specialties</h3>

            <h3>Where to Eat</h3>
            <p>
              Parque de los Novios has numerous restaurants. For fresh seafood,
              try the restaurants near the marina or in Taganga. Local prices
              are very reasonable compared to most Caribbean ports.

            <h2>Practical Information</h2>
            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>
              Colombian Peso (COP) is the local currency. Approximately 4,000
              COP = 1 USD (2025). US dollars are not widely accepted—withdraw
              pesos at ATMs. Credit cards accepted at larger establishments.
            </p>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>
              Spanish is essential; English is limited outside tourist venues.
              Learn basic phrases or use a translation app.
            </p>

            <h3>Weather</h3>
            <p>
              Hot and humid year-round, typically 28-32°C (82-90°F). The dry
              season (December-April) offers the best weather and clearest
              mountain views. Rainy season brings afternoon thunderstorms but
              usually doesn't disrupt morning activities.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Santa Marta is generally safe for tourists in daytime, especially
              in tourist areas. Standard precautions apply: don't flash
              valuables, use licensed taxis, stay aware of surroundings.
              Colombia's security situation has improved dramatically, but
              common-sense awareness remains important.
            </p>

            <h3>Getting Around</h3>
            <p>
              Taxis are abundant and inexpensive. Agree on fares before
              departure. For Tayrona or mountain excursions, book organized
              tours—logistics are complex.

                <summary>Is Santa Marta safe for cruise passengers?</summary>
                <p>
                  Santa Marta is generally safe for cruise visitors in tourist
                  areas. The historic center, marina, and beach areas are
                  well-patrolled. Use normal precautions—don't flash valuables,
                  use licensed taxis, and stay aware of your surroundings.
                </p>

                <summary>Can I visit Tayrona National Park on a cruise day?</summary>
                <p>
                  Yes, but it's a full-day commitment. Tayrona is about 45
                  minutes from Santa Marta, and reaching the best beaches
                  requires additional hiking. Ship excursions or private tours
                  are recommended. Allow 6-8 hours minimum.
                </p>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta?</summary>
                <p>
                  The Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal mountain
                  range, rising to 5,775m just 42km from the Caribbean shore.
                  Its snow-capped peaks are visible from Santa Marta on clear
                  days. Indigenous communities live in the highlands.
                </p>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What's the best beach near Santa Marta?</summary>
                <p>
                  For cruise visitors with limited time, El Rodadero offers
                  facilities and calm water 10 minutes from port. Tayrona's
                  beaches are more spectacular but require half-day minimum.
                  Playa Cristal is a snorkeling alternative between the two.
