  "description": "The map shows the present-day route of the railway lines connecting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Adelaide\">Adelaide</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Australia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Darwin, Australia\">Darwin</a>, and the route of the former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia_Railway\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Central Australia Railway\">Central Australia Railway</a>.\n<p>The present Adelaide\u2013Darwin standard-gauge link results from several stop-start railway projects spanning 87 years (1917\u20132004). The northern half was built from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarcoola,_South_Australia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Tarcoola, South Australia\">Tarcoola</a> as far as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Alice Springs\">Alice Springs</a> in 1980 and completed to Darwin in 2004. South of Tarcoola, its route to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Augusta\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Port Augusta\">Port Augusta</a> is via the eastern end of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Australian_Railway\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Trans-Australian Railway\">Trans-Australian Railway</a> completed in 1917. The standard-gauge line to Adelaide was opened in 1982.\n</p><p>Construction of the former narrow-gauge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia_Railway\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Central Australia Railway\">Central Australia Railway</a> likewise took a long time, spanning 51 years (1878\u20131929). In showing the routes and opening dates of sections of the narrow-gauge Central Australia Railway following the start of construction in 1878, the map reflects the complex, stop-start nature of the railway's construction caused in part  by the existence of three railway gauges. Although the Central Australia Railway was intended to go to Alice Springs in the centre of the continent, financial constraints both before and after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Australia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Federation of Australia\">Federation</a> in 1901, and subsequent conflicting budgetary and political priorities of the <a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Australia\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Government of Australia\">federal (national) government</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_South_Australia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Government of South Australia\">South Australian (state) government</a>, resulted in that town being reached only in 1929. \n</p>\nThe map also shows  the 1957 standard gauge line, roughly parallel to the 19th century route to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marree,_South_Australia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Marree, South Australia\">Marree</a>, which was built because heavy coal traffic from the new Telford mine was beyond the capacity of the lightly built, flood-prone narrow-gauge railway. Like all of the narrow-gauge line to Alice Springs, the standard-gauge Marree line is closed.",
