# In the Wake â€” Cruise Lines Standards (v3.001)

## Pages
- Use absolute URLs rooted at https://www.cruisinginthewake.com.
- Cross-link to ship pages under `/ships/<line>/<slug>.html` and hub `/ships/index.html`.

## Caching
- Include `site-cache.js` and the pre-warm snippet (same as Root).
- Benefit: users entering via line hubs get data cached before visiting ships/restaurants.
