        <h1>Greenock: The Gateway You Pass Through to Reach Scotland's Heart</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Nobody cruises to Greenock for Greenock. I'll say it plainly: this working port town on the Clyde estuary is a gateway, not a destination. Ships dock here because it's the access point to Glasgow — Scotland's largest city, forty minutes away by train — and to Edinburgh, Loch Lomond, Stirling Castle, and the Highlands beyond. Greenock itself has shipbuilding history and gave the world James Watt, inventor of the modern steam engine. But realistically, you're docking here to go somewhere else.</p>

          <p>And that's perfectly fine. Greenock Ocean Terminal is efficient and well-positioned. The train station is a short walk or shuttle ride away. Trains to Glasgow Central run frequently and cost £6-8 for a 25-45 minute journey depending on the service. You can be standing in George Square or browsing Kelvingrove Museum before your coffee gets cold. Edinburgh is farther — about 90 minutes — but doable with planning. Organized shore excursions handle the logistics if you prefer not to navigate trains and timetables.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Not in Greenock itself, but in Glasgow Cathedral — a short train ride away. The medieval nave soars in dark stone, light filtering through stained glass onto flags hanging from the rafters. I descended to the lower church, a crypt-like space where St. Mungo is buried. A volunteer organist was practicing Bach. The music echoed off stone that's stood since the 1100s. This is why you take the train from Greenock.
          </div>

          <p>If you stay in Greenock, there's a small museum, a James Watt monument, pleasant waterfront walks. It's a genuine Scottish town, not polished for tourists, which has its own charm. But Glasgow beckons. The architecture, the museums (many free!), the energy of Scotland's biggest city. Or take a tour to Loch Lomond — bonnie banks and Highland scenery just an hour north. Greenock is your launching pad. Use it wisely.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Glasgow (40 min by train)</h4>
          <p>Scotland's largest city, 25 miles from Greenock. Glasgow Cathedral (medieval masterpiece), Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum (FREE, world-class), George Square, Merchant City, Buchanan Street shopping, vibrant culture. Train £6-8, departs frequently from Greenock. Spend your day here — it's what Greenock is really for.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Loch Lomond & Trossachs National Park</h4>
          <p>Scotland's most famous loch, about 1 hour north of Greenock. "Bonnie banks" immortalized in song, surrounded by Highland scenery. Village of Luss, boat cruises, walking trails, stunning views. Organized tours from Greenock/Glasgow recommended. Full or half-day excursion.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Stirling Castle</h4>
          <p>Dramatic hilltop fortress where William Wallace and Robert the Bruce fought for Scottish independence. Renaissance palace, Great Hall, spectacular views over the Highlands. About 1.5 hours from Greenock. Full-day excursion. Often combined with Loch Lomond or Edinburgh tours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Edinburgh (1.5-2 hours)</h4>
          <p>Scotland's capital is accessible but ambitious from Greenock. Train to Glasgow, then Glasgow to Edinburgh (75 miles total, 1.5-2 hours). Organized shore excursions handle logistics. If you want Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile, book a tour. Independent travel is doable but eats your day in transit.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">McLean Museum & Art Gallery (Greenock)</h4>
          <p>If you stay in Greenock: FREE museum covering local shipbuilding history, James Watt inventions, Egyptian antiquities, and Scottish art. Small but interesting. 10-minute walk from Ocean Terminal. Allow 1 hour.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">James Watt Birthplace</h4>
          <p>Modest cottage where the steam engine pioneer was born in 1736. Small heritage site in Greenock. Free. Quick stop if you're interested in industrial history. Most visitors skip it in favor of Glasgow.</p>
