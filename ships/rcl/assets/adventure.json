Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## Intro\nBoarding at Port Canaveral with kids, grandparents, and a carry-on stuffed with chargers and snacks felt like herding cats—until we stepped into *Adventure* and the chaos turned to awe. Our multigenerational crew (teens, a grade-schooler, a toddler, and grandpa in a wheelchair) found a floating playground where every age got a win.\n\n## Crew & Care\nBartenders remembered lemonades, room stewards learned nap schedules, and doors seemed to open right when grandpa needed them. It felt designed for us.\n\n## Entertainment\nStudio B’s ice show had the teens filming spins like sports highlights; I face-planted on FlowRider and got a sticky soft-serve high-five from a nine-year-old. Promenade parades + arcade duels = someone always yelling “best day ever.”\n\n## Dining\nWindjammer won weekdays; **Chops Grille** delivered the “whoa” steaks; **Giovanni’s Table** = nonna-energy comfort. MDR handled a nut allergy calmly and correctly.\n\n## Accessibility Notes\nElevator access to all public decks; theater companion seating; pool lifts on request; accessible staterooms with roll-in showers.\n\n## Closing\nFrom toddler giggles to grandpa’s big-band sway, our week stitched memories into every salty gust.",
