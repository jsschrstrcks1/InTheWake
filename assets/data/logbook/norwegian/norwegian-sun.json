But I wanted the places too small for 4,000-passenger ships. I wanted the Alaska that required intimacy.\n\n[Norwegian Sun](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-sun.html) fit.\n\nAt around 2,000 passengers, Sun navigates passages that larger ships skip. We docked in ports where locals noticed our arrival\u2014not because ships were rare, but because ships this size felt like visitors rather than invasions.\n\nIn Icy Strait Point, the dock accommodated our size perfectly. We walked into wilderness that larger ships only photograph from a distance. A local guide said, 'We like when your ship comes. You don't overwhelm us.'\n\nThat became the pattern. Ports where crew members knew regular passengers. Whale watching where our ship didn't compete with three identical vessels. Glacier viewing where silence meant something because fewer people were breaking it.\n\n**The truth:** Sun's smaller size isn't a limitation for Alaska\u2014it's an advantage. Intimate ports, manageable crowds, genuine access.\n\nI've cruised Alaska on mega-ships since. The scenery is identical. The experience isn't. Sun showed me Alaska; others showed me Alaska's capacity limits.",

'Something that feels like a ship, not a mall.'\n\nI went alone.\n\nThe smaller size saved me. On a mega-ship, anonymity would have swallowed me. On Sun, the crew noticed. Not intrusively\u2014they didn't pry or force sympathy\u2014but they remembered my face. My name. My coffee order.\n\n'Traveling alone?' a server asked gently on night two.\n\n'Recently alone,' I admitted. 'My husband passed.'\n\nHe nodded. 'The ocean is good for that. She's held grief before.'\n\nBy cruise end, I knew a dozen crew members. The bartender who saved my corner seat. The ma\u00eetre d' who stopped asking if anyone was joining me. The cabin steward who left extra tissues without comment.\n\n**The truth:** Sun's intimate scale creates community without forcing it. Grief needs witness, not audience. Smaller ships provide witness.\n\nI cruise Sun annually now. Same cabin. Same grief, slowly softening. Robert chose well. He always did.\n\n**The lesson:** Grief needs beautiful places to breathe.",

Roll-in shower, wide doorways, space that acknowledged wheels as normal transportation. But the ship was just the beginning.\n\nSun's accessible excursion planning exceeded expectations. In Juneau, an accessible vehicle took me to Mendenhall Glacier on paths I could navigate. In Ketchikan, a covered tour let me experience the rainforest without wrestling terrain. In every port, options existed\u2014not perfect options, but real ones.\n\nThe deck viewing areas were designed for everyone. I watched glaciers calve from spots where my chair didn't block anyone. Crew members asked about my needs without treating them as burdens.\n\n'We get a lot of wheelchair guests for Alaska,' one said. 'You shouldn't miss glaciers because of wheels.'\n\n**The truth:** Sun's accessible Alaska works because the ship plans for it. Accessible excursions exist. Viewing areas accommodate. Crew understands.\n\nI've cruised Sun's Alaska three times. Each voyage proves Alaska isn't impossible. Difficult, yes. Requires planning, absolutely. But not impossible.

Our cabin steward left celebratory surprises we hadn't requested. The bartender knew our drinks by night two.\n\nAlaska's scenery provided the romance mega-ships manufacture artificially.
