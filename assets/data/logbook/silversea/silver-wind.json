      "markdown": "**When my father said he wanted to see polar bears before he died, our family faced a challenge: Arctic expedition that could accommodate eighty-year-old grandfather, forty-something parents, and teenage adventurers. Silver Wind's converted elegance solved every complication.**\n\nOur group was seven: Dad at eighty-two, my sister and me, our spouses, and two teenagers whose energy levels exceeded ours combined. Silver Wind's 274-guest expedition capacity meant we weren't lost in crowds but weren't suffocatingly intimate either. The converted expedition design merged classic Silversea comfort with genuine polar capability.\n\nOur butler coordinator, Erik, specialized in multi-generational expedition groups. He understood immediately that Dad couldn't do every Zodiac landing, teenagers would want maximum adventure, and we parents needed flexibility between both extremes. He created individualized daily plans that kept family connected while honoring different capabilities.\n\nThe expedition team proved remarkably adaptable. They designed shore excursions at multiple intensity levels: vigorous hikes for teenagers, moderate walks for parents, gentle strolls for Dad when he could manage. Nobody was excluded; options existed for every energy level and mobility condition.\n\nThe crisis came during Dad's ultimate objective: polar bear sighting. The expedition team had spotted bears on distant ice, accessible only by longer Zodiac journey that Dad's stamina couldn't manage. He faced missing the moment he'd traveled so far to experience.\n\nThe expedition leader found a solution. He positioned Dad on the ship's observation deck with the expedition photographer and the ship's best telescope. The Zodiac team coordinated by radio, positioning their crafts to drive bears toward viewing range. Dad watched from perfect vantage as polar bears walked across ice—closer, actually, than Zodiac passengers saw.\n\nThe photographer captured extraordinary images: bears with Arctic sun behind them, ice formations gleaming, the moment Dad had dreamed of for decades. He printed them aboard the ship that evening, presenting Dad with documentary evidence of dreams achieved.\n\nDinner that night brought unexpected emotion. The expedition leader asked Dad to share his story with fellow passengers—why polar bears mattered, what the sighting meant. Dad spoke about childhood books about Arctic exploration, decades of hoping, family who'd made the journey possible. Fellow passengers—strangers that morning—became witnesses to generational dream fulfilled.\n\nSilver Wind's converted design enabled what purpose-built expedition ships sometimes sacrifice: comfort that sustained Dad through challenging days, elegance that made evenings celebratory, butler service that managed complex family logistics. The expedition capability came without losing the Silversea soul that made the ship feel like luxury home rather than adventure vessel.\n\nDad passed away eleven months later. The polar bear photographs hang in my home, his memorial to adventure achieved. Silver Wind gave our three generations shared experience that transcended tourism—genuine expedition that honored both our patriarch's dream and his limitations.",

Silver Wind's Arctic expedition delivered romance wrapped in parka and wonder, exactly what our marriage needed to begin.**\n\nWe'd met on a hiking trip; beaches held no appeal. When Silver Wind's Svalbard itinerary appeared during wedding planning, we knew immediately: polar bears and glaciers would witness our new marriage rather than palm trees and poolside bars.\n\nOur butler, Astrid, understood expedition honeymoons require different approach than tropical alternatives. She ensured our suite became warm sanctuary after cold Zodiac adventures—heated towels waiting, hot chocolate prepared, the contrast between exterior challenge and interior comfort heightening both experiences.\n\nThe expedition team adapted seamlessly. They positioned us together in Zodiacs, allowed us moments of privacy at landing sites, captured photographs that showed two newlyweds against backdrops of glaciers and wildlife rather than the usual champagne-on-beach clichés. Our wedding rings appeared in images beside walrus colonies and Arctic fox dens.\n\nThe crisis came during challenging sea conditions in the Norwegian Sea. My wife—experienced hiker but inexperienced sailor—became severely seasick. The expedition she'd anticipated with such excitement became misery she endured with diminishing hope. She wanted to cancel remaining landings, hide in our suite, and survive until reaching calmer waters.\n\nAstrid intervened with practical compassion. She coordinated with the ship's doctor for effective medication timing. She ensured our suite remained refuge—calm colors, gentle motion mitigation, careful attention to what scents and foods triggered versus soothed. She found passengers who'd overcome similar seasickness on previous expeditions, facilitating conversations that offered hope rather than sympathy.\n\nBy day three, my wife had adapted. Her first Zodiac landing after recovery—approaching a glacier calving ice into steel-blue water—became the voyage's emotional peak. She wept from relief and wonder simultaneously while I held her and expedition photographers captured what became our favorite honeymoon image.\n\nThe expedition team celebrated her recovery with characteristic warmth. The naturalist who'd guided that Zodiac landing found us at dinner, sharing her own seasickness struggles from early career expeditions. The chef prepared comfort foods my wife had mentioned missing during her illness. The community witnessed and supported her triumph.\n\nOur final expedition moment came at midnight sun—actually 2 AM, but the Arctic summer made time irrelevant. Astrid had arranged private viewing time on deck, champagne waiting, the sun circling the horizon rather than setting while we watched together. The naturalist provided commentary about what we were seeing; then he withdrew, leaving newlyweds alone with the universe's most spectacular light.\n\nSilver Wind gave us a honeymoon that matched our marriage's character: adventurous, occasionally challenging, ultimately triumphant. We returned home with photographs of polar bears rather than palm trees, stories of Zodiac landings rather than spa treatments. The expedition start to our marriage set the tone for adventures we've continued together since.",

Silver Wind proved him wrong—not by ignoring my age but by adapting expedition to honor both my limitations and my still-fierce desire for adventure.**\n\nI'd dreamed of Arctic wildlife since childhood nature documentaries. Retirement years had slipped past while I waited for \"the right time\" that never came. Silver Wind's Svalbard expedition became now-or-never decision. My children worried; my grandchildren cheered; I booked.\n\nMy butler, Ingrid, assessed my capabilities without condescension. She asked practical questions: how far could I walk comfortably, what mobility challenges should she anticipate, which expedition activities mattered most versus which I'd sacrifice. Her frankness respected my intelligence while establishing realistic expectations.\n\nThe expedition team included me without patronizing. They explained each landing's physical requirements honestly—which I could manage, which would challenge me, which I should skip. The honesty enabled planning rather than forcing me to confront limitations publicly during departures.\n\nI managed more than anticipated. The Zodiacs accommodated my stiff knees with surprising grace. Shorter walks to wildlife viewing points were available when longer hikes exceeded my stamina. Fellow passengers assisted naturally—offering arms on uneven terrain, sharing observations when my eyes needed rest.\n\nThe crisis came during the expedition's signature moment: glacial ice landing. Walking on actual glacier ice had been my specific dream—the photograph I'd envisioned for decades. But the terrain proved too challenging; the expedition leader gently suggested I remain in the Zodiac while others explored.\n\nI didn't argue. At seventy-eight, I've learned to accept limits without bitterness. But the expedition photographer noticed my disappointment. He spoke quietly with the leader, who then approached with alternative: a brief Zodiac landing at the glacier's edge, where ice met water in stable formation I could actually stand on.\n\nThe team positioned me carefully on that ice edge—genuine glacier beneath my boots, though flat enough for my uncertain balance. The photographer captured exactly what I'd dreamed: seventy-eight-year-old woman standing on Arctic ice, expedition parka worn with pride, glacier rising behind. My grandchildren have that image framed.\n\nBack aboard, the ship's comfort sustained what expedition demanded. Hot meals after cold landings. Butler service anticipating needs before I articulated them. The elegant dining room where I could share expedition stories with fellow travelers who understood the achievement each landing represented.\n\nSilver Wind's converted design—expedition capability grafted onto classic Silversea elegance—suited elderly adventurers perfectly. We need both elements: the expedition experiences that justify the journey and the comfort that enables us to continue. At seventy-eight, I found both aboard this ship.

I sailed Silver Wind carrying his research folder and his ashes, completing the expedition he'd meticulously planned but never lived to experience.**\n\nJames's folder contained everything: specific wildlife he'd wanted to see, expedition activities he'd prioritized, ports he'd researched for independent exploration. His notes covered sixteen pages of anticipation now impossible to share. I decided to experience it for both of us.\n\nMy butler, Helena, learned my situation during embarkation. She studied James's notes as carefully as I had, understanding which expedition moments mattered most based on his research. \"We'll check off his list together,\" she said. \"He'll be with us.\"\n\nThe expedition team became partners in my memorial voyage. The naturalists who led Zodiac excursions knew which wildlife James had specifically wanted to see. They pointed out each species with quiet acknowledgment: \"There's the Arctic fox he mentioned.\" The shared awareness transformed sighting into tribute.\n\nScattering ashes presented practical challenges the team solved with grace. They identified appropriate locations—spots James would have loved based on his notes—and facilitated private moments at each. The expedition leader coordinated Zodiac positioning to give me solitude during scattering while keeping me safe in challenging waters.\n\nThe crisis came at polar bear sighting—James's ultimate dream, the expedition's emotional peak. A mother and cubs appeared on distant ice, precisely what he'd hoped to witness. I broke down completely, weeping in the Zodiac while fellow passengers pretended not to notice, overwhelmed by the beauty James would never see.\n\nThe expedition photographer captured the bears extensively, then approached me afterward. He'd noticed my grief, heard my story from Helena. He offered to create a dedicated album of just the polar bear images, something I could place beside James's research folder as evidence his dream had been achieved. The gesture transformed my breakdown into meaningful mourning.\n\nFellow passengers became unexpected community. Several had lost spouses; expedition voyages seemed to attract travelers processing major transitions. We found each other naturally, sharing stories over dinner, supporting each other through expedition moments that triggered memories. The 274-guest capacity enabled genuine connection without overwhelming intimacy.\n\nMy final scattering happened at Svalbard's most dramatic glacier—a location James had circled repeatedly in his notes. Helena had coordinated with the expedition team for extended Zodiac time, positioning me where the glacier calved ice into water James had dreamed of seeing. I poured the last of his ashes into that Arctic water while speaking aloud everything I wished I'd told him before the cancer ended words between us.\n\nSilver Wind completed James's expedition perfectly. Every item on his checklist, every species he'd researched, every experience he'd anticipated—all achieved on his behalf by a widow who refused to let cancer cancel what love had planned. The expedition he never lived to take became the memorial he deserved.",

Silver Wind proved that creative adaptation enables adventure for travelers who navigate the world differently.**\n\nI've used a wheelchair since spinal injury at thirty-four. At fifty-one, I'd assumed expedition cruising was permanently off my list. Arctic wildlife remained dream rather than plan. When I discovered Silver Wind's accessibility adaptations, skepticism competed with hope. I booked anyway.\n\nMy butler, Anders, specialized in accessible expedition experiences. His first question wasn't about my limitations but about my goals: which expedition moments mattered most, what would I sacrifice versus prioritize, how could the team maximize my experience within genuine constraints? His framing respected my agency while establishing honest parameters.\n\nThe expedition team had clearly trained for accessible guests. They'd identified which landings could accommodate wheelchairs, which could be adapted with crew assistance, and which genuinely couldn't work. The transparency enabled planning rather than repeated disappointment during departures.\n\nZodiac operations required significant adaptation, but the team delivered. They'd developed transfer protocols specifically for wheelchair users—practiced, smooth, dignified rather than embarrassing. Crew members positioned themselves for my safety without making me feel like problem requiring management. I boarded Zodiacs alongside other passengers, my chair secured, my participation normalized.\n\nThe crisis came at my most-anticipated landing: the walrus colony James had researched so extensively in his notes. The terrain genuinely couldn't accommodate wheels—rocky, uneven, potentially dangerous for anyone but especially problematic for my situation. I faced missing the expedition's signature wildlife experience.\n\nThe expedition leader found an alternative I hadn't imagined. He positioned my Zodiac at optimal distance from the colony—close enough for genuine wildlife experience, far enough to avoid disturbing the animals. While other passengers landed, I watched from water that offered actually better viewing angles. The naturalist in my Zodiac provided commentary that exceeded the landed experience's rushed observation.\n\nThe photographer captured walruses from my Zodiac position—images that showed the colony from perspectives landed passengers couldn't achieve. My limitation became advantage; my photographs exceeded what walking participants obtained.\n\nFellow passengers supported rather than pitied. Several assisted with small challenges throughout—holding doors, retrieving items, including me in conversations that assumed my equal participation. The 274-guest community was small enough to know me individually, large enough that I wasn't constant center of attention.\n\nSilver Wind's converted design—original elegance preserved through expedition modification—enabled accessibility that purpose-built expedition ships sometimes sacrifice. The wider corridors from classic cruise ship origins accommodated my chair beautifully. The butler service that Silversea maintains provided assistance beyond expedition-specific needs.\n\nI returned home with Arctic wildlife photographs, Zodiac landing memories, and proof that expedition cruising doesn't require exclusion.

Expedition cruising worried me: would I be isolated third wheel to couples sharing adventure? Would my solo status become conspicuous during Zodiac departures?\n\nMy butler, Kristina, understood solo expedition dynamics immediately. She explained that Silver Wind's 274 guests included significant solo contingent—expedition cruising attracts independent travelers seeking experiences beyond typical tourism. I wouldn't be anomaly; I'd find community among like-minded adventurers.\n\nThe expedition team normalized solo participation seamlessly. Zodiac assignments grouped guests by interest rather than traveling party—birders together, photographers together, general wildlife enthusiasts together. Solo travelers dispersed naturally among groups rather than clustering awkwardly.\n\nDining alone on expedition ship proved easier than expected. Mealtimes became expedition debriefing: passengers sharing what they'd seen, comparing photographs, planning tomorrow's priorities. Conversation flowed around shared experience rather than social obligation. I joined tables easily, contributed naturally, withdrew when solitude appealed.\n\nThe crisis revealed solo expedition's vulnerability. During challenging landing in rough conditions, I slipped on wet rocks and wrenched my knee badly—not serious injury, but enough that returning to Zodiac required assistance I couldn't provide myself. Alone in remote location, I faced genuine problem.\n\nFellow passengers responded immediately. Two helped me hobble back to the Zodiac while a third retrieved my dropped camera. The expedition leader had medical kit ready. Nobody made me feel burdensome or stupid; they treated my injury as shared concern requiring collaborative solution. The solo status I'd worried about became irrelevant—I was community member requiring community support.\n\nBack aboard, Kristina had already coordinated with ship's medical team. They examined my knee, provided treatment, and cleared me for modified participation in remaining landings. The expedition leader adjusted upcoming activities to accommodate my limitations—shorter walks, Zodiac-only observation when terrain challenged.\n\nThe solo expedition community Kristina had mentioned materialized naturally. Several independent travelers gravitated together over voyage's duration—sharing meals, comparing observations, supporting each other's solo adventures. We weren't lonely people seeking company; we were independent travelers choosing connection on our own terms.\n\nMy final expedition moment came at spectacular ice formation Kristina had mentioned as worth special effort. I'd described wanting one iconic Arctic photograph; she'd researched which landing offered best opportunity. The expedition photographer positioned me perfectly, capturing solo traveler against dramatic glacial backdrop. The image shows independence and adventure simultaneously.\n\nSilver Wind demonstrated that expedition cruising welcomes solo travelers genuinely. The adventure creates shared experience that transcends traveling-party status. The community forms around common wonder rather than social convention. I returned home with memories of Arctic expedition achieved independently, supported by community that chose connection without requiring companionship.",

Silver Wind proved that expedition doesn't require endurance—it requires curiosity.**\n\nMy husband had researched expedition ships exhaustively. Pure expedition vessels seemed spartan; mainstream ships with expedition features seemed diluted. Silver Wind's conversion from classic cruise ship to expedition vessel promised middle ground: genuine expedition capability with Silversea service. We booked Arctic Norway hoping for northern lights and wildlife, uncertain whether we'd survive the adventure.\n\nOur butler, Ingrid, specialized in first-time expedition guests. She recognized our nervousness immediately and reframed everything. 'Expedition isn't about toughness,' she explained. 'It's about willingness. The naturalists will teach you; the crew will support you; the ship will return you to comfort after every adventure.'\n\nThe Zodiac training eliminated my terror within an hour. The expedition team demonstrated boarding, explained safety protocols, and practiced with us until the inflatable boats felt natural. By our first landing, I'd forgotten I'd ever been afraid—the Arctic landscape demanded attention too completely for fear.\n\nThe naturalists transformed observation into understanding. When we spotted polar bears on distant ice, the marine biologist explained their hunting patterns, their habitat challenges, their uncertain future. Wildlife became story rather than sighting. I'd expected to see animals; I learned to comprehend ecosystems.\n\nThe crisis came on day five. During a Zodiac excursion near a glacier, our engine failed. We drifted among ice chunks while the guide radioed for assistance, the cold seeping through our expedition gear. Other Zodiacs couldn't reach us quickly—the ice field was too dense. For forty minutes, we floated in Arctic silence, uncertain when rescue would arrive.\n\nThe guide remained completely calm. He used the unexpected pause to explain glacial formation, pointing out ice strata that told climate stories spanning millennia. He identified seabirds resting on nearby floes. He transformed equipment failure into extended lecture, his expertise converting fear into fascination.\n\nRescue arrived via a second Zodiac that navigated the ice field skillfully. We returned to Silver Wind cold but exhilarated—the malfunction had created experience we'd never have had otherwise. The expedition leader met us at the gangway with hot chocolate and apologies; the hotel director ensured our suite was prewarmed and blankets were waiting.\n\nThe tearjerker moment came on our final evening. The naturalist who'd kept us calm during the ice field drift presented us with a photograph he'd taken during our unplanned adventure—our Zodiac surrounded by ice, arctic light glowing on our faces, the glacier towering behind us. He'd signed the back: 'To fellow explorers who discovered that expedition rewards the curious, not the tough.'\n\nFor first-time expedition cruisers: Silver Wind provides the support that makes adventure accessible.

We'd endured bad food, cramped cabins, and limited amenities because expedition mattered more than comfort. Silver Wind promised we didn't have to choose.\n\nOur butler, Kristin, understood veteran expedition priorities immediately. She knew we cared more about landing schedules than wine service, more about naturalist quality than restaurant variety. But she also knew that after thirty expeditions of compromised comfort, we deserved both: excellent expedition and excellent care.\n\nThe expedition team rivaled any we'd encountered on purpose-built vessels. The marine biologist had published research we'd actually read. The ornithologist identified species we'd spent years trying to distinguish. The glaciologist explained ice formations with precision that deepened every glacier encounter. Quality naturalists can serve any ship; Silversea had recruited the best.\n\nThe crisis came from our own veteran overconfidence. On day four, I insisted on joining a more challenging Zodiac excursion despite the expedition leader's gentle suggestion that conditions were deteriorating. My wife followed reluctantly. Forty minutes into the landing, weather shifted dramatically—wind, waves, and sudden cold that tested our expedition experience.\n\nThe guides managed the situation with professional calm that validated every expedition dollar we'd spent. They'd anticipated the possibility; backup plans activated smoothly. We returned to Silver Wind windburned but safe, humbled by nature's reminder that thirty expeditions still hadn't made us invincible.\n\nKristin had our suite prepared for recovery: heated towels, hot soup, the specific whiskey I'd mentioned enjoying after cold expeditions. The combination of adventure and comfort felt unprecedented—we'd returned from genuine challenge to genuine luxury.\n\nThe dining quality exceeded anything we'd experienced on expedition ships. After thirty voyages of adequate-at-best expedition cuisine, La Terrazza served Italian that would have impressed us on land. The Restaurant offered options; previous expedition ships had offered necessity. We ate well between adventures for the first time in our expedition careers.\n\nThe tearjerker moment came during the expedition recap on our final evening. The expedition leader had assembled a video montage of our voyage—wildlife encounters, glacier approaches, Zodiac landings in challenging conditions. At the end, he'd included footage from the weather crisis: our Zodiac battling waves, the guides working skillfully, our safe return to Silver Wind.\n\n'Thirty expeditions,' he said, looking directly at us, 'and you're still willing to learn. That's what makes veteran explorers valuable—not experience, but humility.'\n\nFor expedition veterans considering Silver Wind: the conversion works. Genuine expedition capability, authentic adventure, quality naturalists—all wrapped in Silversea service you've never experienced on purpose-built vessels. You can finally have both.",

When we spotted our first polar bear, the naturalist dedicated the sighting to our thirty years of shared adventure. When we approached a calving glacier, the marine biologist explained that some ice had formed around the time we'd married—we were witnessing water from our wedding year returning to sea.\n\nThe crisis threatened everything. On day four, severe weather forced cancellation of the Zodiac landing where Lars had secretly arranged for an anniversary surprise. The expedition leader announced we'd remain shipboard, exploring ice from observation decks rather than inflatable boats. Our carefully planned celebration seemed impossible.\n\nLars refused to let weather win. He coordinated with the expedition team to create alternative: a private viewing session in the ship's highest lounge, expedition staff providing personal narration of the wildlife and ice we could observe from the windows. The chef prepared an anniversary tasting menu served in this private space. The sommelier had found champagne from our wedding year.\n\nWe celebrated thirty years surrounded by Arctic grandeur, unable to land but able to witness everything from warm comfort. The polar bear that appeared on distant ice during our private dinner felt like universe acknowledging our milestone. Lars had somehow orchestrated nature's participation.\n\nThe tearjerker moment came on our final expedition morning. The weather had cleared; the expedition leader announced a surprise landing specifically for our anniversary. The guides had found a remote bay where we'd be the only humans. They set up a small table on Arctic tundra, served champagne in expedition cups, and left us alone for thirty minutes of anniversary solitude in one of Earth's most remote places.\n\nMy wife and I sat together on rocks where possibly no human had ever sat before, toasting three decades of marriage while Arctic terns circled overhead. The naturalist photographed us from respectful distance—proof that we'd celebrated where celebration seemed impossible.\n\nSilver Wind hadn't just hosted our anniversary; it had made the Arctic our witness. Thirty years of marriage, commemorated at the edge of the world.\n\nFor couples seeking extraordinary celebration settings: Silver Wind proves that expedition and celebration coexist beautifully. The crew will coordinate with nature itself to honor your milestones. Some anniversaries deserve polar bears as witnesses.",

      "markdown": "**My son died in a climbing accident four months before I boarded Silver Wind for Arctic Norway. The expedition wasn't about forgetting him—it was about finding a landscape vast enough to hold my grief without being consumed by it.**\n\nMichael had been an adventurer. He'd climbed mountains, kayaked remote rivers, sought wild places that most people only see in photographs. When he died on a Himalayan peak at twenty-eight, the world felt diminished—all those wild places he'd never explore, all those adventures interrupted permanently.\n\nMy therapist suggested I find a landscape that would honor his adventurous spirit while providing space for my grief. My daughter suggested Silver Wind's Arctic expedition—adventure with support, wildness with care. The butler service would help when grief overwhelmed; the expedition would honor who Michael had been.\n\nMy butler, Solveig, learned about Michael during our first conversation. She didn't offer platitudes; she asked what he'd been like, what he'd loved, what adventures he'd completed before the one that killed him. She treated him as person rather than tragedy—exactly what I needed.\n\nThe expedition team included Michael naturally in their interactions with me. When we spotted Arctic foxes, the wildlife guide mentioned that Michael would have appreciated their adaptation. When we approached a challenging Zodiac landing, the expedition leader suggested that Michael's spirit was watching. They'd obviously been briefed; their inclusion felt genuine rather than performed.\n\nThe crisis came during a glacier landing. Standing on ancient ice, surrounded by overwhelming white and blue, I completely broke down. The grief I'd been managing erupted into sobs that echoed off ice walls. Other passengers witnessed my collapse; humiliation competed with sorrow.\n\nThe naturalist who'd been leading our group sat beside me on the ice. He didn't try to stop my crying; he simply waited. When I could finally speak, I told him about Michael—the climber who'd never see these glaciers, the adventurer whose adventures had ended too soon.\n\n'He's here,' the naturalist said simply. 'Every wild place holds the spirits of everyone who loved wild places. Your son is in this ice. He's in every expedition you take from now on.'\n\nWe sat together on that glacier for thirty minutes. Other passengers continued exploring; nobody rushed us. The expedition team had created space for grief within adventure—exactly the combination my healing required.\n\nThe tearjerker moment came on our final evening. Solveig had coordinated something extraordinary: a small ceremony on the observation deck, expedition team participating, Michael's photograph displayed beside candles. The captain spoke about adventurers who take risks knowing the cost. The naturalists shared their own losses—colleagues who'd died in the wild places they studied.\n\nI scattered a small portion of Michael's ashes into Arctic waters as the ship passed a glacier he would have loved. The expedition team saluted. Solveig held my hand.\n\nSilver Wind didn't heal my grief—nothing heals that grief. But the Arctic taught me that wild places persist despite human loss, that beauty continues regardless of personal tragedy, that Michael's spirit could accompany me on adventures he'd never take himself.\n\nFor those carrying unbearable loss: Silver Wind's expedition provides landscapes vast enough to hold grief without being defined by it. The crew will witness your sorrow while surrounding it with wonder. Michael would have loved this ship. Now, through me, he has.",
