        <h1>Akureyri: Where Giants Swim Beneath the Midnight Sun</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Sailing into Eyjafjörður — Iceland's longest fjord — feels like entering a cathedral built by geology and time. Snow-draped peaks rise on both sides, their reflections shimmering in water so still it looks painted. The ship glides past farms clinging to hillsides, past waterfalls threading down black basalt cliffs, past fishing boats that nod in our wake. And somewhere beneath us, in depths measured in hundreds of meters, the giants are feeding.</p>

          <p>Akureyri calls itself the "Capital of the North," and it wears the title with quiet confidence. Iceland's second-largest urban area (population 19,000) sits tucked at the fjord's southern end, where mountains shelter it from Arctic winds and summer brings 24-hour daylight. The floating pier deposits you directly in front of Hof Cultural Centre — a striking glass-and-concrete building that looks like Iceland distilled into architecture. You don't need taxis or shuttle buses. You walk off the ship and you're already there.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Watching a humpback whale breach 200 meters from our boat, its 40-ton body suspended impossibly in midair against a backdrop of mountains still wearing winter snow in June. The splash when it hit sent waves rippling outward in perfect circles. The guide — a woman who'd been running whale tours for 15 years — had tears in her eyes. "You never get used to it," she said. "Never." The whale breached again, and a collective gasp ran through everyone on deck, strangers united in wonder. That's what Iceland does. It reminds you that astonishment isn't dead, just dormant.
          </div>

          <p>The whale watching here isn't a maybe-you'll-see-something affair. Eyjafjörður is prime feeding territory for humpbacks, minkes, white-beaked dolphins, harbor porpoises, and occasionally blue whales — the largest animals ever to exist on Earth. Tour operators are so confident they offer a "Wildlife Guarantee": see nothing, and you get a free retry within two years. I've never heard of anyone needing it. The whales know this fjord is home.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Whale Watching from Akureyri</h4>
          <p>World-class whale watching departing directly from the cruise pier. Eyjafjörður fjord hosts humpback whales, minke whales, blue whales (rare), white-beaked dolphins, harbor porpoises, and summer puffins. <strong>Classic tours:</strong> 2.5-3.5 hours, family-friendly, larger boats with indoor seating. <strong>Express tours:</strong> 1.5-2.5 hours on 12-seat RIB boats — faster, closer encounters. Warm overalls and blankets provided. Wildlife Guarantee included. Book in advance; tours often sell out. This is why you came to Akureyri.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Goðafoss — Waterfall of the Gods</h4>
          <p>One of Iceland's most spectacular waterfalls, 30 minutes east of Akureyri. Goðafoss plunges 12 meters across a 30-meter-wide horseshoe — powerful, accessible, and steeped in history (legend says Iceland's pagan idols were thrown here when the country converted to Christianity in 1000 AD). Free. Viewing platforms on both sides. Combine with Lake Mývatn for full-day tour. Even non-waterfall people are stunned by Goðafoss.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Lake Mývatn & Geothermal Wonders</h4>
          <p>Volcanic wonderland 90 minutes from Akureyri. Lake Mývatn ("Midge Lake") sits in an active geothermal zone offering: <strong>Dimmuborgir</strong> — dramatic black lava formations resembling a collapsed fortress; <strong>Hverir (Námafjall)</strong> — bubbling mud pools, hissing steam vents, sulfur deposits painting the earth yellow and orange; <strong>Mývatn Nature Baths</strong> — geothermal lagoon (less crowded than Blue Lagoon). Full-day excursion. Surreal landscapes that feel like another planet. Bring layers; weather changes fast.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Akureyrarkirkja Church</h4>
          <p>Iconic Lutheran church perched on a hill overlooking Akureyri. Designed by Guðjón Samúelsson (same architect as Reykjavík's Hallgrímskirkja), consecrated 1940. Stunning stained glass, intricate pipe organ, panoramic views of fjord and town. 15-minute walk uphill from port (steep but rewarding). Free entry (donations welcome). Services Sundays. The exterior is photographed endlessly; the interior is quietly beautiful.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Akureyri Botanical Garden (Lystigarður Akureyrar)</h4>
          <p>The world's northernmost botanical garden (just 50 km from Arctic Circle). Founded 1912, showcasing subarctic flora, Icelandic plants, and surprisingly diverse international collections thriving in long summer daylight. Peaceful walking paths, benches, café. 10-minute walk from port. Free entry. Open June-September. For plant lovers and anyone seeking quiet beauty after whale-watching adrenaline.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Húsavík Day Trip (Optional)</h4>
          <p>Europe's "Whale Watching Capital," 90 minutes northeast of Akureyri. Charming fishing village with excellent whale museum, colorful harbor, and alternative whale tours (if Akureyri tours full). Often combined with Goðafoss waterfall. Requires full-day tour. Worth considering if you want both whales and a second charming Icelandic town.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Akureyri downtown is compact and walkable from pier. Akureyrarkirkja church is uphill (15 min, steep). Botanical Garden 10 min walk. Everything central is accessible on foot.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port but limited supply. Credit cards accepted. Expensive (Iceland prices). Book in advance for guaranteed pickup.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available but costly (~€80-120/day). Roads excellent, scenic, but distances long and fuel expensive. Only worthwhile for independent full-day exploration.</li>
            <li><strong>Tours:</strong> Most practical for Goðafoss, Lake Mývatn, Húsavík. Shore excursions or local operators (book online in advance). Whale watching departures steps from ship.</li>
            <li><strong>Bike Rental:</strong> Available downtown. Akureyri is bike-friendly with dedicated paths. Good for Botanical Garden or coastal exploring.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Icelandic Fish:</strong> Arctic char, cod, haddock — incredibly fresh, simply prepared. Fish &amp; chips elevated to art form. Try it at harbor-side restaurants.</li>
            <li><strong>Lamb:</strong> Icelandic sheep graze freely on highlands. Lamb stew (kjötsúpa) is hearty, traditional, perfect for cool days. Slow-roasted lamb shank divine.</li>
            <li><strong>Skyr:</strong> Thick Icelandic yogurt (technically cheese) — high protein, tangy, served with berries. Breakfast staple, dessert base.</li>
            <li><strong>Kleinur:</strong> Twisted Icelandic doughnuts — fried, lightly sweet, cinnamon-cardamom spiced. Bakery essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Dogs (Pylsur):</strong> Iceland's beloved street food — lamb-based, topped with crispy onions, remoulade, ketchup, sweet mustard. Don't mock it until you try it.</li>
            <li><strong>Brennivín &amp; Beer:</strong> Brennivín ("Black Death") is caraway-flavored schnapps (acquired taste). Local craft beers excellent — Einstök, Kaldi, Borg breweries.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dress in layers — weather changes in minutes. Waterproof jacket essential. "There's no bad weather, only bad clothing" is Iceland's motto.</li>
            <li>Credit cards accepted everywhere (even public restrooms). Cash rarely needed. Tipping not customary.</li>
            <li>Book whale watching in advance — tours sell out, especially on cruise days. Classic tours better for families/those prone to seasickness; RIB boats more adventurous.</li>
            <li>Summer means midnight sun (June-July sun barely sets). Don't plan sleep around darkness. Eye masks help.</li>
            <li>Respect nature barriers — geothermal areas can cause severe burns. Stay on marked paths at Hverir/Námafjall.</li>
            <li>Iceland is expensive — budget €15-25 for casual meals, €8-12 for beer, €4-6 for coffee. No surprise charges; it's just pricey.</li>
            <li>Ask whale guides about puffins (summer only) — these comical seabirds nest on coastal cliffs May-August.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: At the floating pier directly in front of Hof Cultural Centre in downtown Akureyri. You walk off the ship into the town center. Whale watching tours depart from the same pier.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What whales can I see?</strong><br/>A: Eyjafjörður is home to humpback whales, minke whales, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises. Blue whales, orcas, and fin whales appear occasionally. Summer brings breeding puffins. Success rate very high.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is whale watching worth it?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. Akureyri offers world-class whale watching in a stunning fjord setting. Tours depart steps from the ship, conditions are typically calm, and sightings are nearly guaranteed (Wildlife Guarantee included).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I see Goðafoss waterfall?</strong><br/>A: Yes! Goðafoss is 30 minutes from Akureyri — accessible via shore excursion or taxi/rental car. Often combined with Lake Mývatn for full-day tour. Absolutely worth visiting.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How long is summer daylight?</strong><br/>A: June-July, the sun barely sets (midnight sun). It dips near the horizon around midnight but never truly gets dark. By late August, normal day/night returns.</p>
