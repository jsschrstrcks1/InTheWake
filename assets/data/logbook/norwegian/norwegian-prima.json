      "markdown": "**I booked Norwegian Prima three weeks after the divorce was finalized.**\n\nMy therapist called it 'radical self-care.' My mother called it 'running away.' I called it survival. Twenty-three years of marriage, two grown children, and suddenly I didn't know who I was without the word 'wife' attached to my name.\n\nPrima's [Ocean Boulevard](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-prima.html) changed everything. This outdoor promenade wrapping the entire ship meant I was never stuck in a hallway with nowhere to go. When the dining room felt too quiet (table for one, please), I could walk outside and watch the wake trail behind us\u2014miles of churned water marking where we'd been, pointing toward where I was going.\n\nThe first night, I stood at the glass railings near [Indulge Food Hall](/restaurants.html), crying into my champagne. A crew member named Rodrigo appeared with a tissue and a smile. 'First cruise alone?' he asked. When I nodded, he said, 'The ocean teaches us\u2014we are never truly alone. The water connects everything.'\n\nHe walked me to [Infinity Beach](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-prima.html), the adults-only area where the pool seems to spill into the sea. 'Sit here tomorrow at sunset,' he said. 'You'll understand.'\n\nI did. And I did understand. Surrounded by strangers who became friends, watching the sun sink into water that stretched to horizons I'd never imagined, I remembered who I was before I became someone's anything.\n\n**The truth:** Prima's design intentionally creates what Norwegian calls 'social spontaneity'\u2014spaces where connection happens naturally. For solo travelers, this means you're never isolated unless you choose to be. for more.\n\n**The lesson:** Solitude doesn't have to mean isolation.",

'Look,' she said, showing me deck plans. 'Ocean Boulevard is completely flat. Wide enough for two wheelchairs side by side. And these infinity pools\u2014they have lift access.'\n\nDad said no. Mom said yes. We booked it anyway.\n\nThe first morning, I pushed Dad's wheelchair onto Ocean Boulevard at sunrise. He gripped the armrests like he was bracing for disappointment.

I saw something I hadn't seen since the stroke: curiosity.\n\nWe did the full loop. Then we did it again.

Butler service that anticipates needs before you voice them. It felt less like a cruise and more like a floating sanctuary.\n\nOur butler, James, noticed the tension immediately. He didn't comment, but the first evening, he arranged dinner on our private balcony instead of the Haven restaurant. 'Sometimes,' he said, 'couples need to remember why they chose each other. The sea helps with that.'\n\nWe ate lobster tail while the sunset painted the water gold. We talked\u2014really talked\u2014for the first time in weeks. About the wedding stress. About expectations.
