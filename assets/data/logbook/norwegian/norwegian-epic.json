Solo travel meant solo pricing, and solo pricing meant staying home.\n\nThen someone at Norwegian invented [The Studios](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html).\n\nThese single-occupancy cabins on [Norwegian Epic](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) were designed for people like me. No supplement. No penalty for being one person. Just a clever cabin with everything I needed and nothing I didn't.\n\nBut the cabin wasn't the revelation. [Studio Lounge](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) was.\n\nThis private lounge\u2014accessible only to Studio guests\u2014became my living room for a week. Continental breakfast with other solo travelers. Evening cocktails with people who'd chosen this same adventure. By day two, I had friends. By day four, I had dinner companions for every meal.\n\n'I thought solo cruising meant lonely cruising,' a teacher from Maine confessed over morning coffee.\n\n'That's what they want us to think,' I answered. 'Epic proves it's not true.'\n\nWe explored Barcelona together. Split a wine tour in Provence. Formed a group that texted long after the cruise ended.\n\n**The truth:** Epic's Studios aren't just cabins\u2014they're a social system. Solo travelers find community without the forced pairing of shared tables.\n\nI've cruised Studios three times now. Never paid a supplement. Never felt alone. Norwegian figured out what other lines couldn't: solo travelers want options, not penalties.\n\n**The lesson:** Solitude doesn't have to mean isolation.",

      "markdown": "**We wanted Europe for our honeymoon. Epic gave us all of it.**\n\nThe honeymoon debate had been endless. Italy? France? Spain? Greece? Every country deserved weeks, and we had two. Traditional travel meant choosing one. [Norwegian Epic](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) meant choosing all.\n\nThe Mediterranean itinerary read like our wedding registry of destinations. Barcelona. Marseille. Rome. Naples. Every day a different country. Every night together on our floating hotel.\n\nThe Studios cabin surprised us. Designed for solo travelers, it offered couples efficient space without luxury pricing. We weren't honeymooning in the room\u2014we were honeymooning in Europe. The cabin just needed to be comfortable.\n\nComfortable it was. But the romance happened elsewhere.\n\nAt [The Spiegel Tent](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html), acrobats performed over our dinner while the Mediterranean stretched beyond the tent walls. We held hands through courses, too enchanted to speak.\n\nIn Rome, we threw coins in the Trevi Fountain\u2014promise to return, promise to remain. In Barcelona, we walked Las Ramblas at midnight, the city ours.\n\nThe crew noticed our wedding bands, our constant touching, our inability to stop smiling. Champagne appeared unprompted. Best tables materialized. The romance we'd hoped for became romance the ship amplified.\n\n**The lesson:** Epic's Mediterranean delivers honeymoon destinations that land travel requires months to match.",

      "markdown": "**Three generations had never vacationed together successfully.**\n\nGrandparents who needed rest. Teenagers who needed stimulation. Parents who needed both and got neither. Every family vacation had ended with someone unhappy. My mother suggested Epic as last resort.\n\n'A ship big enough for all of us,' she reasoned. 'Everyone can do their own thing.'\n\n[Norwegian Epic's](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) variety proved her right.\n\nThe [Aqua Park](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) consumed my teenagers. Waterslides I couldn't have dragged them from if I'd tried. They'd emerge for meals, sunburned and happy, then disappear again.\n\nMy parents found [The Manhattan Room](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html)\u2014classic elegance they'd missed from golden-age cruising. Quiet dinners. Live music. Service that matched their standards.\n\nMy wife and I? We found [The Spiegel Tent](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-epic.html) and remembered we were still a couple, not just logistics managers.\n\nBut the magic was convergence. Shore excursions united us\u2014teenagers as interested in the Colosseum as grandparents. Evening shows brought three generations to the same seats. The Mediterranean became shared experience despite our different days.\n\n'This actually worked,' my father admitted at the farewell dinner.\n\n'Everyone's happy,' my teenager agreed\u2014high praise from a fifteen-year-old.\n\n**The lesson:** Epic accommodates multi-generational families through variety and reunion points.",
