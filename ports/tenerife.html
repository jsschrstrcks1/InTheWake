The summit can be 15-20°F colder than Santa Cruz, and altitude may cause shortness of breath. Clouds often form mid-morning, so early visits offer clearer views. Weather at sea level doesn't always reflect conditions at altitude."

Mount Teide blocks these clouds, creating a rain shadow that keeps the south perpetually sunny and dry. This dramatic climate difference exists on the same small island — north can be 10°F cooler and cloudy while south basks in sunshine."

The north receives more rain (November-March), but even then it's typically brief showers rather than all-day downpours. If visiting northern attractions like Anaga Mountains, a light rain jacket is wise, but rain rarely impacts cruise port activities or Mount Teide excursions."

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Mount Teide dominates Tenerife the way Table Mountain dominates Cape Town — impossible to ignore, spiritually significant, geologically dramatic. But where Table Mountain is flat, Teide is a perfect volcanic cone rising 3,718 meters (12,198 feet) from the Atlantic, making it Spain's highest peak. The Guanche people, Tenerife's indigenous inhabitants before Spanish conquest, believed Teide was a gateway to the underworld where the devil lived. Standing at the cable car summit looking down at clouds spreading below like ocean surf, I understood why they saw divinity and danger in this place.</p>

          <p>Tenerife is study in contrasts. The south is sun-baked, resort-lined, warm year-round — package holiday territory. The north is greener, cloudier, more traditionally Canarian. Santa Cruz, where cruise ships dock, is the island's working capital — not pretty but authentic, with Art Deco architecture, excellent food markets, and locals who go about their lives unconcerned with tourists. This isn't a place pretending to be paradise. It's a Spanish island that happens to have near-perfect weather, volcanic landscapes that could pass for Mars, and some of the clearest night skies on Earth.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> A stargazing tour on Mount Teide after sunset. The guide — a Canarian astronomer who spoke like poetry — explained why Tenerife's skies are among the world's best: high altitude, low light pollution, stable atmosphere. He pointed his laser at Mars, then Jupiter, then Saturn's rings visible through his telescope. A German tourist started crying. "I never saw the Milky Way before," she said. "I didn't know it was real." The guide smiled. "Most people don't. We forget to look up." In that moment, standing on an ancient volcano under more stars than I knew existed, I felt small and grateful and profoundly lucky to be alive.
          </div>

          <p>La Laguna, the island's former capital, is UNESCO World Heritage — a perfectly preserved colonial town with wooden balconies, cobbled streets, university students arguing in cafés. It feels like stepping into 18th-century Spain. If you only see Santa Cruz and Mount Teide, you'll miss what makes Tenerife more than just another beach destination.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mount Teide National Park & Cable Car</h4>
          <p>Spain's highest peak (3,718m) and UNESCO World Heritage site. Otherworldly volcanic landscapes — lava fields, rock formations, lunar-like terrain. Cable car to 3,555m (~€40 round-trip). Book online days in advance — sells out. Summit permit (free) required for final 200m to peak. About 90 min from port. Full-day excursion. Dress warm — temperature drops significantly at altitude.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">La Laguna (San Cristóbal de La Laguna)</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage colonial town — former capital of Tenerife. Preserved 16th-century architecture, colorful buildings, wooden balconies, student atmosphere. About 20 min from Santa Cruz by bus or tram. Excellent restaurants and cafés. Allow 2-3 hours. Combine with Mount Teide or beach day.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Loro Parque</h4>
          <p>World-class zoo and aquarium in Puerto de la Cruz (45 min from port). Orcas, dolphins, penguins, parrots, gorillas. Excellent facilities and animal care. ~€42 adults. Very popular with families. Allow 4-5 hours. Free shuttle from Puerto de la Cruz center. Book online for discounts.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Playa de Las Teresitas</h4>
          <p>Most beautiful beach near Santa Cruz — golden sand (imported from Sahara), palm trees, calm waters. About 20 min from port by bus or taxi. Great for swimming, less crowded than southern beaches. Local vibe, Spanish families. Free. Bring towel and sunscreen.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mercado de Nuestra Señora de África</h4>
          <p>Santa Cruz's main market — fresh produce, seafood, meats, flowers, local products. Moorish architecture, bustling atmosphere. Sunday morning is peak time. Perfect for Spanish breakfast (coffee and pastry). Free to explore. 15 min walk from port. Allow 1-2 hours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Anaga Mountains & Laurel Forest</h4>
          <p>Ancient laurel forest (UNESCO Biosphere Reserve) in island's northeast. Hiking trails, dramatic coastline, remote villages. Masca village (accessible from south) famous for gorge hike. Full-day excursion. Organized tours recommended for transportation and guidance. Bring layers — weather changes quickly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Stargazing Tours</h4>
          <p>Tenerife has some of world's clearest night skies (Teide Observatory is here for a reason). Evening stargazing tours on Mount Teide include sunset, astronomy talk, telescope viewing. ~€65-90. Book in advance. Weather-dependent. Unforgettable experience if conditions are right.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Transportation tips for cruise visitors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Santa Cruz downtown is flat and walkable from port. Most attractions require transport.</li>
            <li><strong>Tram:</strong> Modern tram connects Santa Cruz to La Laguna (~€1.35). Scenic, efficient, air-conditioned. Buy tickets at machines.</li>
            <li><strong>Buses (Guaguas):</strong> Extensive network covering whole island. TITSA company operates routes. Buy Bono-Vía card for discounts. English timetables online.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Metered and reasonably priced for short trips. Fixed rates for longer journeys (agree before departure). Available at port.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Good option if you want flexibility. Roads well-maintained. Mountain routes winding. Parking easy in Santa Cruz.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Best for Mount Teide, Anaga Mountains, multiple stops in one day. Hotels and cruise terminal offer booking.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Lessons learned the hard way.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book Teide Cable Car Early:</strong> Sells out days (sometimes weeks) in advance, especially peak season. Without reservation, you can't ride. Book the moment you know your port date.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather is Weird:</strong> South can be 25°C and sunny while north is 15°C and cloudy. Mount Teide can be 5°C at summit. Bring layers no matter the forecast.</li>
            <li><strong>Duty-Free Shopping:</strong> Canary Islands are outside EU customs area. Tobacco, alcohol, perfume significantly cheaper. Cruise terminal has duty-free shops.</li>
            <li><strong>Lunch Timing:</strong> Spaniards eat lunch 2-4pm, dinner 9-11pm. Restaurants may be closed or limited outside these hours. Plan accordingly or eat tourist schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Try Papas Arrugadas:</strong> Canarian wrinkled potatoes with mojo sauce (red or green). Simple, delicious, everywhere. Perfect with fresh fish.</li>
            <li><strong>Barraquito Coffee:</strong> Tenerife's layered coffee drink — espresso, condensed milk, steamed milk, licor 43, lemon, cinnamon. Sweet, strong, spectacular. Order one after lunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Beach North vs South:</strong> North beaches (like Las Teresitas) have golden sand but cooler, cloudier weather. South beaches have black volcanic sand but guaranteed sunshine. Choose based on priorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Stargazing vs Cable Car:</strong> If you can only do one, choose based on personality: adventurous daytime hikers pick cable car; contemplative night owls pick stargazing. Both extraordinary.</li>
          </ul>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: When is the best time of year to visit Tenerife?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">March through May and September through November offer ideal conditions — pleasant temperatures (68-75°F), less crowded attractions, and lower prices. Summer (June-August) is busiest with European holidaymakers and hotter in the south. Winter (December-February) is mild but can be cloudier in the north, though the south stays reliably sunny.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: What should I pack for Tenerife weather?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Layers are essential — even in summer, Mount Teide can be 20°F colder than sea level. Pack sunscreen and a hat for strong UV exposure, comfortable walking shoes for La Laguna's cobblestones, a warm jacket for altitude excursions, and a light rain jacket if visiting northern attractions. Swimwear if heading to southern beaches.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Does Tenerife have a hurricane season?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">No — the Canary Islands are outside the hurricane belt. Tenerife enjoys stable year-round weather with minimal storm risk. The climate is subtropical with mild winters and warm summers, moderated by Atlantic trade winds. Weather is reliably pleasant any time of year, though the north receives more rain November through March.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Will weather affect my Mount Teide visit?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Possibly — the cable car closes in high winds or poor visibility, which happens occasionally even in summer. Check conditions before your visit. The summit can be 15-20°F colder than Santa Cruz, and altitude may cause shortness of breath. Clouds often form mid-morning, so early visits offer clearer views. Weather at sea level doesn't always reflect conditions at altitude.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Why is the north cloudier than the south?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Trade winds bring moisture from the Atlantic to the northern slopes, creating clouds and supporting lush vegetation. Mount Teide blocks these clouds, creating a rain shadow that keeps the south perpetually sunny and dry. This dramatic climate difference exists on the same small island — north can be 10°F cooler and cloudy while south basks in sunshine.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Will rain ruin my visit to Tenerife?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Rain is uncommon in Tenerife, especially in the south which averages under 10 inches annually and boasts 300+ days of sunshine. The north receives more rain (November-March), but even then it's typically brief showers rather than all-day downpours. If visiting northern attractions like Anaga Mountains, a light rain jacket is wise, but rain rarely impacts cruise port activities or Mount Teide excursions.</p>

            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Santa Cruz de Tenerife port, within easy walking distance of downtown. Modern terminal with good facilities.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Can I visit Mount Teide without booking the cable car?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — the drive through Teide National Park is spectacular and free. You can hike lower trails without cable car tickets. But cable car to near-summit is the highlight. Book ahead.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Is Tenerife good for beach lovers?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes, but beaches are far from Santa Cruz port. South coast (Playa de las Américas, Los Cristianos) is 75+ km away. Las Teresitas is closest good beach (20 min). Organized beach excursions available.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: What's better: Tenerife or Gran Canaria?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Tenerife has Mount Teide (dramatic), better colonial architecture (La Laguna), and superior stargazing. Gran Canaria has better beaches and sand dunes. Both excellent. Choose Tenerife for nature/culture; Gran Canaria for beaches.</p>
          </details>

          <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
            <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Do I need to speak Spanish?</summary>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Helpful but not essential. Tourist areas have English. Santa Cruz proper is very Spanish-speaking. Basic phrases appreciated.</p>
