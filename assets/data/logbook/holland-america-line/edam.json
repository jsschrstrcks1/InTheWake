      "markdown": "**SS Edam carried the name of Edam, the Dutch town famous for its cheese—continuing Holland America Line's practice of celebrating Dutch geography.**\n\nThe naming convention served multiple purposes. It reinforced the company's Dutch identity at a time when many shipping lines obscured their national origins. It created recognizable branding that passengers remembered. And it honored the Netherlands' cities and regions that the company served.\n\nEdam the town sits north of Amsterdam, known worldwide for its distinctive round cheeses. The ship Edam carried that association across the Atlantic, a floating ambassador for Dutch culture.\n\nHolland America would continue this naming tradition for over a century. Modern ships still carry names like Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and Zaandam—echoing the early vessels that established the pattern.\n\nFor heritage context: When passengers boarded Edam, they boarded the Netherlands itself. The name reminded emigrants of what they were leaving and Americans of where the ship originated.",

      "markdown": "**SS Edam represented Holland America Line's investment in expanding transatlantic capacity during the emigration boom of the late 19th century.**\n\nThe company needed ships—many ships—to serve growing demand. European emigration to America peaked in these decades. Millions sought passage, and HAL built its fleet to serve them.\n\nEdam joined sister ships on the Rotterdam-New York run, adding capacity to an increasingly profitable route. Each ship represented significant capital investment and risk. Ships could be lost to weather, collision, or mechanical failure.\n\nThe fleet that Edam joined established Holland America as a major transatlantic carrier. The company competed with German, British, and other Dutch lines for emigrant traffic.\n\nFor fleet history: Edam wasn't exceptional—she was essential. Each vessel in HAL's early fleet contributed to building the company that still sails today.",

      "markdown": "**The passenger lists from SS Edam tell stories of hope, desperation, and courage—families risking everything for American opportunity.**\n\nEach manifest recorded names, ages, occupations, and destinations. Young men seeking work in American factories. Families fleeing religious persecution. Farmers whose land could no longer support them. The records capture individual histories within mass migration.\n\nEdam's crossings brought passengers to Castle Garden, then Ellis Island—the processing centers that determined who could enter America. Most passed through; some were turned back. The ship's role ended at the dock, but passengers' American stories began there.\n\nFor descendants researching ancestry, Edam's records may hold crucial documentation. Ship manifests often provide the last records of European identity before families began their American transformation.\n\nFor genealogical research: Search Edam's passenger lists through Ellis Island Foundation and Ancestry databases. The records connect modern families to their immigration origins.",
