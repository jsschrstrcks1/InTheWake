        <h1>Da Nang: Where Ancient Kingdoms Meet the South China Sea</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The approach to Vietnam's central coast feels like crossing a threshold between worlds. Some ships dock at Tien Sa Port — "descending fairy" — just seven kilometers from Da Nang's city center, while others berth at Chan May, about an hour north. Either way, you're arriving at a place that has transformed from sleepy colonial outpost to modern metropolis in barely two generations, yet remains tethered to an ancient past that refuses to fade.</p>

          <p>I've learned not to measure a port by what's immediately visible at the waterfront. Da Nang's gift isn't its skyline — though the city has certainly embraced modernity with enthusiasm — but what it holds close. Within an hour's drive from wherever your ship docks, three UNESCO World Heritage Sites wait like chapters in a book you didn't know you needed to read: the amber-lanterned merchant houses of Hoi An Ancient Town, the jungle-reclaimed Hindu temples of My Son Sanctuary, and the imperial grandeur of Hue. This is a port of extraordinary reach.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's history is written in layers here, each one visible if you know where to look. The Champa kingdom flourished along this coast for a thousand years, building Hindu temple complexes in the jungle and carving shrines into marble mountains. Then came centuries of Chinese influence, French colonial ambitions that left behind baguettes and boulevards, the devastating years of the American War, and finally the surging resilience of a nation determined to reclaim both prosperity and memory. Da Nang embodies that determination. It's a city racing forward while holding tight to what matters.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing inside Huyen Khong Cave within the Marble Mountains — one of five limestone hills named for the ancient elements of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth — as afternoon light poured through a natural opening in the stone ceiling. The light fell across Buddhist altars that have received prayers since these mountains served as a Hindu sanctuary for the Champa kingdom centuries ago. But there's more layered into this sacred space: during the war, these caves sheltered soldiers and operated as field hospitals. Bullet scars are still visible on the rock face near the Buddha statue. I stood there longer than I'd planned, feeling history and faith occupy the same air, the same stone, the same silence. Some places hold more than one truth at once.
          </div>

          <p>Then there's the Dragon Bridge — Cầu Rồng — stretching 666 meters across the Han River like a steel serpent laid down in homage. Opened on March 29, 2013, it marks the thirty-eighth anniversary of Da Nang's liberation, and the dragon itself carries centuries of meaning: strength, prosperity, good fortune woven into Vietnamese identity. The American firm Louis Berger Group designed it, but the soul is entirely Vietnamese. If you're in port on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening, position yourself along the riverfront at 9 PM. The dragon breathes fire and water for about fifteen minutes, and the whole city stops to watch. It's spectacle, yes, but it's also pride made visible — a city announcing that it has arrived.</p>

          <p>Hoi An, thirty kilometers south, delivers everything the guidebooks promise and then some. Yes, it's touristy — you'll be offered custom tailoring within five minutes of arrival — but the tailoring is legitimately excellent and absurdly affordable. More importantly, the town's soul remains intact. The entire old quarter is car-free, a UNESCO-protected time capsule where merchant houses built by Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese traders four centuries ago still stand, still glow amber from silk lanterns after sunset. Walk the streets at dusk, try cao lau noodles from a family recipe unchanged in generations, and watch fishermen cast nets on the Thu Bon River just as they have for longer than anyone can remember.</p>

          <p>And then there's My Son. If Angkor Wat represents the apex of Khmer temple architecture, My Son is Vietnam's quieter, more intimate answer — the "Angkor Wat of Vietnam," some call it. This Hindu temple complex dates to the fourth century, built by the Champa kingdom as a holy city deep in the jungle. Wars, weather, and time have taken their toll, but what remains still whispers of devotion. The stonework is extraordinary, the jungle setting otherworldly. It's a half-day excursion from Da Nang, and worth every minute.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminals:</strong> Tien Sa Port ("Descending Fairy") — 7 km from Da Nang city, 30 km from Hoi An; or Chan May Port — about 1 hour north of Da Nang center, closer to Hue</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Hoi An:</strong> 30 km from Tien Sa / 45 min by taxi or arranged transport</li>
            <li><strong>UNESCO Sites:</strong> Three within reach — Hoi An Ancient Town (30 km), My Son Sanctuary (70 km), Hue Imperial City (accessible from Chan May)</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock directly at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Vietnamese Dong (VND); USD widely accepted but change given in dong</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Vietnamese; English spoken at tourist sites, less common elsewhere</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; traffic is chaotic — taxis or organized transport recommended</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> February–May (warm, dry); avoid monsoon rains September–December</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Hoi An Ancient Town</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage town 30 km from port. Silk lanterns, 400-year-old merchant houses, Japanese Covered Bridge, riverside cafés. Car-free old quarter. Custom tailoring is world-class and affordable. Plan 4-6 hours minimum. Entry ticket ~$6 covers multiple historic sites.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Marble Mountains (Ngũ Hành Sơn)</h4>
          <p>Five limestone and marble hills rising from the coastal plain, each named for one of the classical elements: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. These mountains served as a Hindu sanctuary for the Champa kingdom for centuries before becoming Buddhist pilgrimage sites. Thuy Son (Water Mountain) is the most dramatic, honeycomb with caves and tunnels. Inside Huyen Khong Cave, natural light illuminates a serene Buddha statue amid rock formations that sheltered field hospitals during the war — bullet marks still visible on stone. The climb rewards you with panoramic views and a profound sense of layered history. Twenty minutes from port. Entry ~$2; elevator available for accessibility.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">My Son Sanctuary</h4>
          <p>Often called the "Angkor Wat of Vietnam," My Son is a UNESCO World Heritage Hindu temple complex built by the Champa kingdom starting in the fourth century. This was their holy city, their spiritual center, nestled deep in jungle-covered hills seventy kilometers from Da Nang. The red brick towers and intricate carvings have weathered centuries of war, monsoons, and the patient work of vines and roots, but what remains still holds power. It's smaller and less restored than Angkor, which somehow makes it feel more intimate, more haunted. The morning light filtering through the trees, the silence broken only by birdsong — this place stays with you. Half-day excursion recommended. Entry ~$6.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Dragon Bridge & Riverfront Da Nang</h4>
          <p>The Dragon Bridge — Cầu Rồng — is modern Da Nang's beating heart and boldest statement. Stretching 666 meters across the Han River, this steel dragon was designed by American firm Louis Berger Group and opened on March 29, 2013, deliberately timed to mark the thirty-eighth anniversary of the city's liberation. In Vietnamese culture, the dragon symbolizes strength, prosperity, and good fortune — virtues this city has claimed for itself with determination. If you're in port on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening, don't miss the spectacle: at 9 PM, the dragon breathes fire from its mouth and sprays water from both sides for about fifteen minutes. Locals and tourists alike line the riverfront to watch, and the energy is electric. Even if you miss the show, strolling the Han River promenade offers a window into contemporary Vietnamese urban life — cafés, street food, families on motorbikes, and a skyline that didn't exist two decades ago. Close to port if time is short.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Ba Na Hills & Golden Bridge</h4>
          <p>French colonial hill station reached by cable car. The Golden Bridge held by giant stone hands is Instagram-famous. Fantasy amusement park atmosphere. 40 km from port. Full-day excursion. ~$35 including cable car.</p>

          <h4  class="mt-1">Vietnamese Cooking Class</h4>
          <p>Several operators in Hoi An offer market tour + cooking class experiences. Learn to make pho, spring rolls, cao lau. Excellent cultural immersion and you eat what you cook. ~$25-40 per person.</p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock?</strong><br/>A: Most ships dock at Tien Sa Port, about 7 km from Da Nang city and 30 km from Hoi An. Some ships use Chan May Port, about one hour north of Da Nang, which is closer to Hue Imperial City.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What are the three UNESCO World Heritage Sites near Da Nang?</strong><br/>A: Hoi An Ancient Town (30 km from Tien Sa), My Son Sanctuary (70 km), and Hue Imperial City (accessible from Chan May Port). All three are reachable as day trips depending on which port your ship uses.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Should I go to Da Nang or Hoi An?</strong><br/>A: Most cruise visitors prioritize Hoi An (UNESCO Ancient Town). Da Nang is modern and energetic; Hoi An is historic and charming. If time allows, see both — the Dragon Bridge show in Da Nang and the lantern-lit streets of Hoi An offer completely different experiences.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: When does the Dragon Bridge breathe fire?</strong><br/>A: Every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening at 9 PM for approximately 15 minutes. The dragon shoots fire from its mouth and water from both sides. Arrive early to claim a good viewing spot along the Han River waterfront.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How do I get to Hoi An?</strong><br/>A: Taxi (45 min, ~$20-25 one-way) or book a shore excursion. Negotiate round-trip taxi fare in advance and confirm the driver will wait for you.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is custom tailoring worth it?</strong><br/>A: Yes! Hoi An's tailors are skilled and affordable. Bring photos of what you want; they can copy anything. Allow time for at least one fitting — many tailors can complete garments same-day or next-day.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Do I need a visa for Vietnam?</strong><br/>A: Many nationalities can enter visa-free for short stays. Check current requirements for your passport before arrival.</p>

I am working my way through the world's cruise ports, one by one, to write what I see with my own eyes and feel with my own heart. This page awaits that day.
