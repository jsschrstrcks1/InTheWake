# In the Wake — v2.033 (GitHub Pages Ready)

- Fixed images not displaying (removed <base>, normalized to `assets/...`, mirrored `Assets/` for case mismatches)
- Deduped ship list (ignored `._*` files); proper title case; links to root `.html`
- Single stylesheet: `assets/styles.css`
- Logo: `assets/logo/logo_teal_white.svg` (teal ship, white text)
- Hero default: `assets/index_hero.svg` (drop `assets/index_hero.jpg` to replace)
- Pages: Deploy from a branch → main → /(root)
