  <h2>Our Review — Chef’s Table on Allure of the Seas</h2>

  <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> Chef’s Table is Royal Caribbean’s apex of artistry — a seven-course crescendo where precision meets passion, transforming fine dining into storytelling. Each dish arrives as performance, each pour a personality, weaving a night of culinary intimacy few experiences at sea match.</p>

  <p><strong>Food:</strong> The journey begins with a translucent Scallop Carpaccio glazed in yuzu and sea salt spark — bright, briny, balanced. By the fifth course, the Beef Wellington emerges rosy and resplendent, its prosciutto cradle whispering smoke over mushroom duxelles. Dessert arrives as a warm soufflé that melts into citrus-tinged grace, capping the meal in mirthful silence. Portions deliberately petite — a dance, not a marathon — and presentation plated poetry. </p>

  <p><strong>Service:</strong> The Chef de Cuisine and sommelier guide each table as hosts and historians. Their banter balances education and entertainment; wine refills arrive before glasses empty, and personal dietary notes feel memorized, not managed. Timing is tight yet graceful — a 2½-hour evening that flows like a rehearsed symphony.</p>

  <p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Held in a private dining room or curated galley nook, the setting glows with amber lamplight and crystal reflections. Conversation hums softly over porcelain chimes and cabernet swirls. On Allure, the chef’s commentary bridges culinary and cultural stories, turning each plate into narrative art. A rare space of quiet grandeur amid a floating city.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> From scallop zest to soufflé sighs, Chef’s Table is a masterclass in measured magnificence — a feast of flavor, finesse, and fellowship. </p>

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.6 / 5 ⭐ — Minor waits for wine refills on busy sails, but an unrivaled value for fine-dining devotees. </p>
