        <h1>Agadir: The City That Rose From Ruins</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Agadir doesn't look like the rest of Morocco. There are no labyrinthine medinas here, no ancient city walls worn smooth by centuries of hands. This is a city rebuilt from memory and necessity — in 1960, an earthquake lasting fifteen seconds killed 15,000 people and reduced the old city to rubble. What rose in its place is something both modern and haunted: six miles of pristine beach, wide boulevards lined with palm trees, and a waterfront promenade where families stroll at sunset while the Atlas Mountains stand watch in the distance.</p>

          <p>The beach is what draws most visitors, and rightly so. It's ten kilometers of golden sand meeting Atlantic surf — Morocco's widest beach, they'll tell you, with the kind of pride reserved for things rebuilt against impossible odds. The promenade stretches along the waterfront, lined with cafes where mint tea arrives in ornate silver pots and tagines steam under conical clay lids. This is Morocco's premier beach resort, sunny more than 300 days a year, where European tourists come for winter warmth and surfers chase Atlantic swells.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on the hilltop Kasbah ruins at dusk, looking down at the city lights beginning to glow. The old fortress walls — one of the few structures to survive the earthquake — bear an inscription in Arabic that translates: "God, Country, King." Below, the rebuilt city spreads across the bay like proof that grief doesn't get the final word. A local man standing nearby told me his grandmother survived the quake. She refused to leave, he said. This was her home. So they built it again.
          </div>

          <p>Beyond the beach, Agadir surprises. Paradise Valley — an hour's drive into the Atlas foothills — delivers palm groves and natural pools tucked between red rock gorges, the kind of oasis that makes you understand why ancient travelers spoke of mirages. Souk El Had, one of North Africa's largest markets, sprawls across 13 acres with over 2,600 shops selling everything from saffron and argan oil to leather slippers and hand-woven carpets. The argan trees grow only in this region; women's cooperatives process the nuts into oil that's become Morocco's liquid gold.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Agadir Beach & Promenade</h4>
          <p>Six miles of golden Atlantic beach — Morocco's longest and widest. Gentle surf, clean sand, palm-lined promenade. Beach clubs, cafes, watersports rentals. 10-minute taxi from port (~30-50 MAD / $3-5). Swimming conditions excellent; lifeguards on duty. Half-day minimum for proper beach time. Sunset stroll essential.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Paradise Valley</h4>
          <p>Stunning palm oasis in Atlas Mountain foothills, 60 km north. Natural rock pools, waterfalls, dramatic gorges, traditional Berber villages. Half-day or full-day tours (~€40-60 per person). Swimming in cool mountain water after desert heat feels transcendent. Bring swimsuit and camera. One of Morocco's hidden gems.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Souk El Had (Sunday Market)</h4>
          <p>Massive covered market — 13 acres, 2,600+ shops. Spices, argan oil, leather goods, ceramics, produce, traditional crafts. Open daily (closed Monday) but busiest Sunday. Bargaining expected. Sensory overload in the best way — saffron, cumin, mint, leather. 2-3 hours minimum. Bring cash and negotiating spirit.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Agadir Kasbah Ruins</h4>
          <p>Hilltop fortress ruins overlooking city and bay. One of few structures surviving 1960 earthquake. Panoramic views of Atlantic coast, modern city, Atlas Mountains. Famous "God, Country, King" inscription in Arabic. Taxi up (~40 MAD), walk down. Sunset timing recommended. Poignant reminder of city's resilience. 1-2 hours.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Argan Oil Cooperatives</h4>
          <p>Women's cooperatives producing Morocco's famous argan oil. Watch traditional extraction process, learn about endemic argan trees, sample products. Several cooperatives near city offer tours. Culinary and cosmetic oils available. Supporting women's economic independence. Educational and meaningful. 1 hour.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Crocoparc</h4>
          <p>Botanical garden and crocodile sanctuary — 300+ Nile crocodiles in naturalistic setting. Educational facility focused on conservation. Beautiful gardens with cacti, palms, bamboo. 15 km south of city. Entry ~60 MAD ($6). Family-friendly. Unexpected but fascinating. 2 hours for full visit.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Most practical for cruise visitors. Abundant at port; negotiate fare before departure. Port to beach ~30-50 MAD ($3-5). Use petit taxis (small, metered) in city; grand taxis for longer trips.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Beach promenade highly walkable once you reach it. Port area industrial — not pedestrian-friendly. City center moderate for walking; sidewalks variable quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Bus:</strong> Local buses cheap (~7-10 MAD) but complicated for visitors. Arabic/French signage, infrequent schedules. Taxis more efficient for limited port time.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Worthwhile for Paradise Valley or Atlas excursions. Major agencies in city (~€30-50/day). Roads good; signage French/Arabic. International license recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Tours:</strong> Shore excursions and local tour operators offer Paradise Valley, Tafraoute, Essaouira day trips. Convenient if time-limited.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tagine:</strong> Morocco's iconic slow-cooked stew — lamb, chicken, or vegetables with preserved lemons, olives, saffron. Cooked in conical clay pot. Every restaurant has their version.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Seafood:</strong> Atlantic fish — sardines, sea bass, prawns — grilled with chermoula (herb marinade). Beach restaurants specialize. Incredibly fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Couscous:</strong> Friday tradition but available daily. Steamed semolina with vegetables, chickpeas, tender meat. Comfort food elevated to art.</li>
            <li><strong>Mint Tea:</strong> National drink — green tea with fresh mint and sugar, served from height into small glasses. Ritual hospitality. Accept if offered.</li>
            <li><strong>Pastilla:</strong> Sweet and savory pastry — pigeon or chicken with almonds, eggs, spices, wrapped in phyllo, dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Unique flavor combination.</li>
            <li><strong>Argan Oil:</strong> Endemic to Morocco. Nutty culinary oil for bread-dipping; cosmetic oil for skin/hair. Buy from cooperatives for authenticity.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice:</strong> Agadir's oranges are legendary. Street vendors squeeze to order. Ridiculously fresh and sweet.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring modest clothing for venturing beyond beach areas. Morocco is conservative; cover shoulders and knees in markets and residential areas.</li>
            <li>Bargaining expected at Souk El Had — start at 50% of asking price, negotiate cheerfully. Fixed prices at modern shops.</li>
            <li>Argan oil quality varies wildly. Buy from cooperatives or reputable shops. Culinary and cosmetic oils are different products — don't confuse them.</li>
            <li>Friday is holy day (Jumu'ah) — many businesses close or reduce hours. Markets quieter; restaurants still open.</li>
            <li>ATMs widely available but notify your bank before travel. Euros accepted at tourist areas but Dirham better rates. Small bills essential for taxis/markets.</li>
            <li>Learn basic Arabic/French phrases. "Shukran" (thank you), "Salam alaikum" (peace be upon you), "La shukran" (no thank you) will serve you well.</li>
            <li>Tap water safe in hotels/restaurants but cruise visitors should stick to bottled. Mint tea always boiled — perfectly safe.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen essential — Atlantic breeze deceives, but UV intense. Agadir averages 300+ sunny days annually.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Agadir?</strong><br/>A: Ships dock at the commercial port, about 3 km from the beach and city center. Taxis readily available at terminal (10 min ride to beach).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Agadir safe for tourists?</strong><br/>A: Yes. Agadir is Morocco's safest major city — modern, well-policed, tourist-focused. Use normal precautions. Aggressive vendors in markets can be pushy but not dangerous.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Should I book Paradise Valley through ship or independently?</strong><br/>A: Both work. Ship excursions guarantee timing but cost more. Local tour operators (~€40-60) offer same trip at better value. Book morning departure for full experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What should I buy in Agadir?</strong><br/>A: Argan oil (from cooperatives), leather goods, traditional ceramics, spices (saffron, ras el hanout), Berber rugs. Negotiate prices at Souk El Had.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I visit other Moroccan cities from Agadir?</strong><br/>A: Marrakech is 3 hours away — too far for port day. Essaouira (3 hours) and Tafraoute (4 hours) possible with very early start or overnight. Agadir itself deserves full day.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br/>A: Moroccan Dirham (MAD) is official. Euros accepted at tourist areas but poor rates. ATMs widespread in city. Bring cash for taxis and markets.</p>
