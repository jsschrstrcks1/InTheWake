      "markdown": "**I wasn't sure I'd like cruising.**\n\nThe idea of being trapped on a ship, seasickness, formal dinners, crowds\u2014every concern kept me from booking. My wife wanted to cruise; I wanted proof I'd survive.\n\n[Norwegian Sky's](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-sky.html) three-day Bahamas cruise was the perfect test.\n\nShort enough that failure wouldn't ruin a vacation. Close to Miami if I needed to escape. Just long enough to actually experience cruising without committing to a week.\n\nBy hour six, I understood the appeal. By day two, I was planning our next cruise. By debarkation, I was a convert.\n\nThe ship's smaller size helped. I could learn the layout in one morning. The Bahamas proximity meant calm waters\u2014no seasickness. The casual atmosphere eliminated formal dinner stress.\n\n'You're smiling,' my wife observed on the last evening.\n\n'I'm planning,' I admitted. 'Which ship should we try next?'\n\n**The truth:** Sky's short cruises exist for skeptics. Test the experience without commitment. Three days proves whether cruising works for you. See [our first cruise guide](/articles.html).\n\nI've cruised fifteen times since that test voyage. Sky converted me. The three-day format gave me permission to try something I'd resisted for years.\n\n**The lesson:** First voyages teach what no brochure can\u2014that cruising is less about the ship and more about who you become aboard her.",

Not a drink package add-on. Not a promotional gimmick. Actual included beverages\u2014beer, wine, cocktails, spirits\u2014throughout the voyage.\n\nI recalculated immediately. The fare looked higher than competitors, but with drinks included, the total was lower. Significantly lower.\n\n'So I can just... order drinks?' I asked the bartender on day one.\n\n'Included,' he confirmed. 'Whatever you want.'\n\nThe psychology shifted too. No more counting drinks and calculating costs. No more deciding if a cocktail was worth $14. I ordered what I wanted when I wanted. The vacation felt like vacation instead of accounting.\n\n**The lesson:** Sky's open bar transforms cruise value calculations.",

We found [Norwegian Sky](/ships/norwegian/norwegian-sky.html) leaving Miami that Friday.\n\nThree days changed everything.\n\nNo meal planning. No kid schedules. No dishes, laundry, or homework. Just my husband and I remembering why we'd gotten married in the first place.\n\nWe slept late. We ordered drinks at noon. We talked\u2014actually talked, not coordinated\u2014for hours on deck while the Bahamas approached.\n\n'When did we stop doing this?' he asked on the second night.\n\n'When we started managing instead of living,' I admitted.\n\nThe short cruise format made it possible. No week of PTO required. No elaborate child care arrangements. Just a weekend, reachable from our house in four hours.\n\n**The truth:** Sky's short cruises exist for desperate couples. When you can't take a week, take a weekend. Three days of partnership can reset months of roommate mode. See [our couples escape guide](/articles.html).\n\nWe cruise Sky quarterly now. The kids stay with family. The marriage stays healthy. Sometimes the shortest escapes matter most.",
