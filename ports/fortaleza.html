          <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Fortaleza greeted me with unrelenting sunshine – this northeastern Brazilian city claims more than 2,800 hours of annual sunlight, earning its reputation as Brazil's sunshine capital. Our ship docked at Terminal Maritimo de Fortaleza, a modern facility surprisingly close to the city center, and I walked out into heat that felt like an embrace rather than an assault. The air smelled of salt water and grilled seafood, and somewhere nearby a speaker played forro music – the accordion-driven rhythm of Ceara state. I had come for the beaches, but Fortaleza would offer more than sand and surf: vibrant arts, exceptional seafood, and that uniquely Brazilian gift for celebrating life in all its messiness. Eight hours seemed insufficient for a city this alive, but I intended to make every moment count.</p>

            <p>Beach Park, thirty kilometers south of the port, consumed my morning. I had booked the excursion through my ship's desk ($85 including transportation and all-day park access) because logistics mattered – Beach Park is Latin America's largest waterpark, and coordinating independent transportation and return timing added unnecessary stress. The Insano waterslide, once the world's tallest at 41 meters, remained heart-stopping even after others claimed the record. I stood at the top, looking down a near-vertical drop, and asked myself why I was doing this. Then I launched, screaming the entire four-second descent, and understood perfectly. The park sprawls across Atlantic shoreline with dozens of attractions – lazy rivers, wave pools, children's areas, and extreme slides for adrenaline seekers. I spent three hours there before the ship excursion bus departed, which felt rushed but left time for afternoon exploration. Families with children could easily spend the entire day here.</p>

            <p>Praia do Futuro delivered the authentic Fortaleza beach experience I had read about. Taxi from Beach Park cost R$50 (about $10) and took thirty minutes. This long, wide beach stretches southeast from the city center, lined with "barracas" – open-air restaurants specializing in lobster, crab, and seafood cooked while you watch. I chose Barraca do Coco based on taxi driver recommendation, ordered the lobster thermidor (R$120, about $24), and settled into a beach chair with an ice-cold caipirinha (R$25, about $5). The lobster arrived split and grilled, covered in cheese sauce, absolutely enormous. Young men offered horseback rides along the waterline. Vendors sold hats, sunglasses, and massages. A Brazilian family at the next table taught their toddler to play in the gentle surf. This was not peaceful – forro music competed with reggaeton, vendors called out constantly – but it was joyfully alive in ways that quieter spots cannot match. I ate every bite of my lobster and ordered a second caipirinha.</p>

            <p>Dragao do Mar arts complex surprised me with its sophistication. The taxi from Praia do Futuro cost R$30 (about $6), and I arrived with two hours before ship departure. This massive cultural center houses museums, theaters, a planetarium, galleries, and cafes in interconnected buildings painted in bold colors. I wandered through the Memorial da Cultura Cearense (free admission), which explained Ceara's folk art, music, and social movements through interactive exhibits. Local artists sold work in open-air stalls. College students gathered on the amphitheater steps, debating something passionately in Portuguese I couldn't follow. The adjacent streets hosted craft vendors, street food carts, and live music that seemed to materialize spontaneously. Fortaleza's arts scene is nationally respected, and Dragao do Mar concentrates that creative energy into walkable blocks. I bought a hand-painted tile (R$40, about $8) and wished for more time.</p>

            <p>My walk back to the port passed through downtown streets where colonial buildings mixed with modern towers. The Cathedral of Fortaleza gleamed white against deep blue sky. Horse-drawn carts shared lanes with honking taxis. Street vendors sold fresh coconut water hacked open with machetes (R$5, about $1). However brief my time in Fortaleza, I left with impressions of warmth that transcended temperature – the warmth of people who smile at strangers, who dance in afternoon heat, who believe that eating grilled lobster on a beach chair constitutes a reasonable Tuesday. Brazil's northeast coast remains less visited than Rio or Salvador, which works in its favor. Fortaleza offers authentic Brazilian beach culture without the tourist overlay, and eight hours barely scratched the surface of what this city holds. I would return for Beach Park alone, but the lobster barracas and the Dragao do Mar would bring me back regardless of waterslides.</p>

            <p>Terminal Maritimo de Fortaleza is a modern cruise facility in the city center. Ships dock directly at the pier – no tender required. The terminal includes tourist information, taxi coordination, and basic services. Downtown Fortaleza begins immediately outside the terminal gates.</p>
            <p>Location is convenient: walking distance to the historic center, short taxi rides to beaches and attractions. Beach Park lies 30 km south (45-60 minutes by bus). Praia do Futuro is 10 km southeast (20 minutes by taxi). Most ships allow 8-10 hours ashore – adequate for Beach Park plus brief city exploration, or a relaxed combination of beach time and Dragao do Mar arts complex. Brazil uses Brazilian Real (BRL); US dollars rarely accepted outside tourist shops. ATMs available near the terminal. Credit cards work at major establishments but bring cash for taxis, street vendors, and smaller barracas.</p>

          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p>Fortaleza spreads along the Atlantic coast with attractions distributed across the metropolitan area. The port sits centrally, but reaching Beach Park or the best beach barracas requires transportation.</p>
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Readily available at the terminal and throughout the city. Metered but confirm approximate fare before departure. Expect R$50-80 ($10-16) to Praia do Futuro, R$100-150 ($20-30) to Beach Park. Taxis are safe and drivers generally honest. Some speak basic English.</p>
            <p><strong>Ship Excursions:</strong> Book ahead through your ship's excursion desk for Beach Park and combination tours. Prices $85-120 including transportation, admission, and guaranteed return timing. Highly recommended for Beach Park given distance and the importance of returning before ship departure.</p>
            <p><strong>Uber:</strong> Available and often cheaper than taxis. Download the app before arrival. Reliable for city transportation but less practical for Beach Park (long wait for pickup in remote area).</p>
            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> The historic center and Dragao do Mar are walkable from the port (20-30 minutes). Bring sun protection – Fortaleza heat is intense. Sidewalks vary in quality. Stay aware of surroundings in less-touristed areas.</p>
            <p>Accessibility note: Fortaleza presents challenges for wheelchair users. Sidewalks are uneven and curb cuts inconsistent. Beach access is difficult on sand. Beach Park has accessible facilities and wheelchair-friendly attractions. Dragao do Mar offers reasonable accessibility with elevators and ramps. Contact ship's excursion desk to discuss specific mobility needs – some tours can accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice.</p>

            <p><strong>Beach Park:</strong> Latin America's largest waterpark with extreme slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and Atlantic oceanfront setting. Insano slide drops 41 meters in 4 seconds. Full-day experience for families and thrill-seekers alike. 30 km from port, 45-60 minutes by bus. Ship excursions $85-120 including transportation and all-day admission – book ahead through your ship's excursion desk for guaranteed return timing. Independent admission R$300+ ($60+) plus taxi. Allow minimum 4 hours in park; full day ideal.</p>

            <p><strong>Praia do Futuro Lobster Lunch:</strong> Fortaleza's signature beach experience. Long sandy stretch lined with barracas (open-air restaurants) specializing in grilled lobster, crab, and seafood. Beach chairs, cold drinks, live music, vendor entertainment. Lobster thermidor R$100-150 ($20-30), caipirinha R$20-30 ($4-6). 10 km from port, R$50 ($10) by taxi. Allow 2-4 hours. Can combine with Beach Park if departing early. Ship excursions available but independent exploration works perfectly.</p>

            <p><strong>Dragao do Mar Arts Complex:</strong> Major arts center with museums, galleries, theaters, craft vendors, and cafes. Memorial da Cultura Cearense (free) explains Ceara folk arts. Vibrant atmosphere especially late afternoon. Walking distance from port (30 minutes) or quick taxi R$15-20 ($3-4). Allow 2-3 hours. Excellent rainy day or afternoon option. Book ahead for special exhibitions through the complex website, though most areas require no reservation.</p>

            <p><strong>Downtown Walking Tour:</strong> FREE self-guided exploration of central Fortaleza. Cathedral, Passeio Publico park, Mercado Central (crafts, hammocks, cashew products), Jose de Alencar Theater (gorgeous interior). Walking distance from port. Allow 2-3 hours. Best in morning before peak heat. Combine with Dragao do Mar for full cultural immersion.</p>

            <p><strong>Jangada Sailing:</strong> Sail on jangada – indigenous log raft with single sail used by Ceara fishermen for centuries. Calm water sailing from Praia de Iracema. R$50-100 ($10-20) for 30-60 minute ride. Authentic local experience but weather-dependent. Book at the beach or through tour operators. Not available through most ship excursion desks.</p>

            <p><strong>Independent vs. Ship Excursions:</strong> Beach Park strongly favors ship excursions – distance makes independent transportation risky for return timing. Praia do Futuro, Dragao do Mar, and downtown exploration work well independently via taxi or Uber. Book ahead through your ship's excursion desk for Beach Park; explore independently for flexible beach and city experiences. Beach barracas need no reservation – simply arrive and choose one.</p>

            <p><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Fortaleza is seriously sunny. High-SPF sunscreen essential – reapply frequently. Hat and sunglasses mandatory. Stay hydrated. Heat stroke is a real risk for visitors unused to tropical exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Safety:</strong> Stay in tourist areas. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics. Use ATMs inside banks or malls. Take official taxis or Uber. Exercise normal urban precautions. Tourist areas are generally safe during daylight hours. Avoid isolated areas after dark.</p>
            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Portuguese spoken; English limited outside tourist venues. Download a translation app. Basic Portuguese phrases appreciated – "obrigado/a" (thank you), "quanto custa?" (how much?).</p>
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Brazilian Real (BRL). US dollars rarely accepted. ATMs widely available. Credit cards work at larger establishments. Bring cash for taxis, street vendors, and beach barracas.</p>
            <p><strong>Bargaining:</strong> Expected at street stalls and with some taxi drivers. Less common at established restaurants. Ask "Tem desconto?" (Any discount?) at craft markets.</p>
            <p><strong>Swimming:</strong> Atlantic currents can be strong. Pay attention to flags and lifeguard warnings. Praia do Futuro is generally safe for swimming in designated areas.</p>

            <p>Fortaleza represents Brazil's northeastern coast at its most welcoming – sunnier than Rio, less overwhelming than Salvador, more authentically Brazilian than either for visitors seeking beach culture without heavy tourist infrastructure. The city of 2.7 million people lives for its beaches, its music, and its seafood, and visitors are invited to share rather than merely observe. A day in Fortaleza leaves impressions of warmth that transcend the tropical climate: the fisherman offering jangada rides, the barraca cook grilling your lobster personally, the street vendor teaching you to pronounce Portuguese words correctly.</p>

            <p>Safety requires standard urban awareness. Stick to tourist areas (port vicinity, Praia do Futuro, Dragao do Mar, Beach Park). Avoid displaying valuables. Use official taxis or Uber. Don't wander into unfamiliar neighborhoods. Exercise the same precautions you would in any large city. Within tourist zones, Fortaleza is generally safe and welcoming. Violent crime against tourists is rare; petty theft is the primary concern. Medical facilities are modern in the city center – private hospitals provide good care.</p>

            <p>Accessibility presents significant challenges. Sidewalks are uneven with inconsistent curb cuts. Beach access on sand is difficult for wheelchairs. Beach Park offers accessible facilities and some wheelchair-friendly attractions. Dragao do Mar has elevators and ramps. Most beach barracas lack accessible facilities. Contact your ship's excursion desk well in advance to discuss specific mobility needs – some operators can accommodate wheelchairs with prior arrangement, though options remain limited compared to North American or European destinations.</p>

          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="collapse-body">
            <p><strong>Q: Is Beach Park worth the trip from the port?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely for families and thrill-seekers. Latin America's largest waterpark with world-class slides. However, it requires 45-60 minutes travel each way and consumes most of your port day. Book through your ship's excursion desk for guaranteed return timing.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Where should I eat lobster in Fortaleza?</strong><br/>A: Praia do Futuro beach barracas offer the authentic experience – grilled lobster thermidor while sitting in a beach chair. Chico do Caranguejo and Crocobeach are popular options. Arrive hungry and allow 2-3 hours for the full experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Fortaleza safe for cruise visitors?</strong><br/>A: Tourist areas are generally safe during daylight hours. Stick to the port vicinity, beaches, Dragao do Mar, and Beach Park. Use official taxis or Uber. Avoid displaying valuables. Exercise standard urban precautions.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I use US dollars in Fortaleza?</strong><br/>A: Rarely. Brazilian Real (BRL) is required for most transactions. ATMs dispense Real; credit cards work at larger establishments. Bring cash for taxis, street vendors, and smaller restaurants.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What's the best time of year to visit Fortaleza?</strong><br/>A: July through December is peak season with dry weather and sunshine. Fortaleza enjoys over 2,800 hours of annual sunshine. The rainy season (February-May) brings brief afternoon storms but sunshine still dominates. Cruise itineraries typically visit during the dry season.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Does Fortaleza have a hurricane or storm season?</strong><br/>A: No hurricanes. The South Atlantic doesn't generate tropical cyclones. The rainy season (February-May) brings brief afternoon thunderstorms that pass quickly. No severe weather typically affects cruise port days.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What should I pack for Fortaleza's weather?</strong><br/>A: High SPF sunscreen (50+) is essential — the equatorial sun is intense. Bring a hat, quality sunglasses, and light breathable clothing. A waterproof phone case is useful for Beach Park. A small umbrella helps during rainy season visits.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Will rain ruin my port day in Fortaleza?</strong><br/>A: Unlikely. Even during rainy season, storms are brief afternoon showers that pass within an hour. Mornings are typically clear. Beach Park operates rain or shine. Most cruise visits occur during the dry season (July-December) when rain is rare.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What should I budget for Fortaleza?</strong><br/>A: Beach Park excursion $85-120. Taxi to Praia do Futuro R$50 ($10). Lobster lunch R$150-200 ($30-40) including drinks. Full day independent exploration R$300-400 ($60-80) total.</p>
