                <p class="logbook-dateline">Red Sea Coast, Egypt</p>

                <p>I've walked through many ports where the past whispers from ancient stones, but Hurghada speaks in a different tongue—one of transformation and the enduring pull of the sea. What was once a quiet fishing village on Egypt's Red Sea coast has become a gateway to underwater wonders that leave you breathless, both from beauty and from holding your breath too long over a coral garden you can't bear to leave.</p>

                <p>The ship docked at Hurghada Port early, and even from the deck I could see the turquoise gradient of the Red Sea—shallow coral reefs glowing aquamarine against the deeper sapphire beyond. The Egyptian sun was already warm at eight in the morning, that dry desert heat that makes you grateful for every breeze off the water.</p>

                <div class="poignant-highlight">
                    <h3>The Moment That Stays With Me:</h3>
                    <p>Floating above a coral reef at Giftun Islands, watching a school of anthias shimmer like living jewels in a shaft of sunlight piercing the clear water. The silence beneath the surface, broken only by my own breathing through the snorkel, felt like being present at creation itself—this riot of color and life thriving in the warm desert sea. I surfaced to find our boat gently rocking, the barren Sinai mountains visible across the water, and realized I was suspended between two wildernesses: one beneath the waves, one above the sand.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Hurghada sits on the Egyptian mainland's Red Sea coast, distinct from the Sinai Peninsula resorts across the water. The city has grown rapidly, sprawling along the coastline in a chain of resort districts—Sigala with its modern marina, Ad-Dahar preserving echoes of the old fishing village, and newer developments like Makadi Bay and Soma Bay stretching southward. But the heart of Hurghada's appeal hasn't changed: these are some of the world's most accessible coral reefs, teeming with life in water so clear you can see thirty meters down.</p>

                <p>I spent the morning on a boat excursion to the Giftun Islands, a marine park just offshore that protects pristine reefs. The boat captain, a man named Ahmed who'd been diving these waters for forty years, pointed out locations like he was naming old friends—"Here, the Napoleon wrasse lives. Very big, very friendly. Over there, the coral garden where baby reef sharks rest."</p>

                <p>Snorkeling in the Red Sea is not like snorkeling anywhere else I've been. The water is bathtub-warm even in winter, so clear you feel like you're flying rather than swimming. Coral formations rise like underwater cathedrals, and the fish—parrotfish munching on coral, clownfish darting into anemones, lionfish hovering with venomous beauty—seem unafraid, going about their business while you float above in wonder.</p>

                        <h3>Docking Location</h3>
                        <p>Ships dock at Hurghada Port, close to the Sigala district. The port has a passenger terminal with basic facilities. Taxis and tour buses are readily available at the port gate.</p>

                        <p>Sigala marina is about 10-15 minutes by taxi from the port. Ad-Dahar (the old town) is 20-25 minutes. Agree on taxi fares before departure—20-30 Egyptian Pounds to Sigala, 40-50 to Ad-Dahar is reasonable.</p>

                <h2>Top Experiences in Hurghada</h2>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>Giftun Islands Marine Park</h4>
                    <p>The crown jewel of Hurghada's waters. Boat trips depart in the morning and typically include two or three snorkel stops around the protected islands. The coral reefs here are phenomenal—healthy hard and soft corals, abundant fish life, sea turtles if you're lucky. Even non-swimmers can enjoy the shallow areas near the beach on Giftun Island. Most tours include lunch on board and equipment. Book through your ship or a reputable operator like Seascape or Aqua Blue.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>Desert Safari and Bedouin Experience</h4>
                    <p>The Eastern Desert begins just beyond Hurghada's resort strip. Safari excursions take you by 4x4 or quad bike into the wadis and mountains where Bedouin families still maintain traditional camps. I visited one in the afternoon—we rode camels as the sun lowered, then sat on carpets in a tent drinking sweet tea and eating fresh-baked bread while our hosts explained their nomadic heritage. The sunset over the empty desert, the Milky Way emerging in the unpolluted sky—it's a counterpoint to the underwater world, equally moving.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>Ad-Dahar Old Town and Souks</h4>
                    <p>The historic heart of Hurghada, Ad-Dahar (also called El Dahar) predates the resort boom. Walk the narrow streets near the Coptic Church, browse the traditional souks selling spices, textiles, and handicrafts. This is where you'll find local restaurants serving koshari and ful medames, where men gather in ahwas (coffee houses) to smoke shisha and play backgammon. Bargaining is expected and part of the social fabric. It's hot, chaotic, and wonderfully authentic—a reminder that beyond the resorts, Egyptian daily life continues.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>El Gouna Day Trip</h4>
                    <p>About twenty minutes north, El Gouna is a purpose-built resort town that's become something special—a network of islands and lagoons connected by bridges, with Venetian-style canals, marina, and a more upscale, artistic vibe than Hurghada proper. The Nubian-style architecture is beautiful, there are excellent restaurants along Abu Tig Marina, and the town hosts a film festival that draws international attention. It's a pleasant escape if you want resort amenities with more sophistication.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>Luxor Excursion (Ambitious)</h4>
                    <p>Luxor lies about 280 kilometers inland—a 4-5 hour bus journey each way through the Eastern Desert. It's a long day, leaving at 5 or 6 AM and returning near dusk, but seeing Karnak Temple, the Valley of the Kings, and Hatshepsut's Temple is a chance to encounter Ancient Egypt's greatest monuments. Only attempt this if your ship has a long stay (ideally overnight) or if you're comfortable with a very full day. The scale of Karnak, the colors still visible in the tombs—it's overwhelming in the best way. Book only with reputable operators who provide good guides and air-conditioned transportation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-item">
                    <h4>Makadi Bay and Soma Bay Resorts</h4>
                    <p>South of Hurghada, these newer resort developments offer pristine beaches and house reefs. If you just want a relaxing beach day with good snorkeling from shore, several resorts offer day passes that include beach access, pools, and lunch. Soma Bay in particular has beautiful turquoise waters and a long stretch of sand. It's less crowded than central Hurghada and the house reefs can be surprisingly good.</p>

            <section id="getting-around">
                <h2>Getting Around</h2>
                <p><strong>Taxis</strong> are the primary way to get around Hurghada. They're plentiful but few use meters, so agree on the fare before entering. From the port: 20-30 EGP to Sigala, 40-60 EGP to Ad-Dahar, 80-100 EGP to El Gouna. Always negotiate in Egyptian Pounds, not dollars, for better rates.</p>

                <p><strong>Microbuses</strong> run along the main coastal road and are very cheap (2-5 EGP) but can be confusing for visitors. They're white minivans that pick up and drop off anywhere along the route. Wave one down and tell the driver your destination.</p>

                <p><strong>Hotel shuttles</strong> are sometimes available from major resorts, though most cruise visitors won't have access unless they've booked through the resort.</p>

                <p><strong>Walking</strong> is practical within districts (like along the Sigala marina or through Ad-Dahar souks) but not between them—distances are long and the main road isn't particularly pedestrian-friendly.</p>

                <p><strong>Organized tours</strong> are often the most practical option for marine excursions, desert safaris, and day trips. Your ship will offer packages, but local operators at the marina often have better prices. Just ensure they're licensed and have good reviews.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="food-drink">
                <h2>Local Food & Drink</h2>
                <p>Hurghada's dining scene ranges from resort buffets to authentic Egyptian eateries tucked in Ad-Dahar's back streets.</p>

                <p><strong>Must-try dishes:</strong> Koshari (Egypt's national dish—lentils, rice, pasta, and chickpeas with tomato sauce and crispy onions), grilled fresh fish from the Red Sea (usually grouper, snapper, or sea bream), ful medames (stewed fava beans, a breakfast staple), ta'ameya (Egyptian falafel made with fava beans, not chickpeas), and mezze plates with hummus, baba ghanoush, and fresh-baked baladi bread.</p>

                <p><strong>Where to eat:</strong> For authentic local food, head to Ad-Dahar. Small restaurants along Sheraton Road serve excellent koshari and grilled meats for a few pounds. Along Sigala's marina, you'll find seafood restaurants where you can select your fish from the display and have it grilled—El Halaka and Fish House are reliable. El Gouna has more upscale options along Abu Tig Marina.</p>

                <p><strong>Drinks:</strong> Egypt is predominantly Muslim, so alcohol isn't ubiquitous, but is available in resort areas, hotels, and some restaurants. Try traditional drinks instead: shai (strong black tea), ahwa (Turkish-style coffee), karkadeh (hibiscus tea served hot or cold), and fresh-squeezed sugarcane juice from street vendors.</p>

                <p><strong>Sweets:</strong> Egyptian desserts are intensely sweet—try basbousa (semolina cake soaked in syrup), konafa (shredded phyllo with nuts and syrup), or om ali (warm bread pudding with milk, nuts, and raisins).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="pro-tips">
                <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sun protection is critical.</strong> The Egyptian sun is intense year-round, and you'll be spending time on boats with reflected UV from the water. High-SPF reef-safe sunscreen, a hat, and a rash guard for snorkeling are essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bring small bills.</strong> Egyptian Pounds in 5, 10, and 20 denominations are useful for tips, taxis, and small purchases. Many vendors can't make change for large notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dress modestly in town.</strong> In Ad-Dahar and local neighborhoods, cover shoulders and knees out of respect. Resort areas and beaches are more relaxed, but you'll feel more comfortable and receive friendlier interactions if you dress conservatively away from tourist zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Book marine excursions early.</strong> The best boats to Giftun Islands fill up quickly, especially during peak cruise season. If booking independently, go to the marina the evening before or book online in advance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn a few Arabic phrases.</strong> "Shukran" (thank you), "min fadlak" (please), and "la, shukran" (no, thank you—useful for persistent vendors) go a long way. English is widely spoken in tourist areas, but the effort is appreciated.</li>
                    <li><strong>The water is safe for swimming but not drinking.</strong> Stick to bottled water. The Red Sea itself is exceptionally clean in the marine park areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tipping is expected.</strong> Called "baksheesh," small tips are customary for anyone who provides a service—bathroom attendants (5 EGP), taxi drivers (round up), boat crew (20-50 EGP depending on service), restaurant staff (10% if service isn't included).</li>
                    <li><strong>For Luxor trips, bring patience and water.</strong> It's a long, hot journey. Bring more water than you think you need, snacks, and prepare for multiple temple sites with lots of walking. A good guide makes all the difference in bringing the history alive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What currency do I need in Hurghada?</h3>
                    <p>The Egyptian Pound (EGP) is the local currency. US dollars and euros are widely accepted in tourist areas, but you'll get better rates exchanging to pounds. ATMs are readily available in the marina and resort districts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I visit Luxor from Hurghada on a cruise day?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but it's ambitious. Luxor is about 4-5 hours by bus each way. Early-morning excursions can visit Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings, but expect a long, full day. Book through your ship or a reputable tour operator.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is the snorkeling good at Giftun Islands?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely exceptional. The Giftun Islands National Park offers some of the Red Sea's most pristine coral reefs with incredible visibility and abundant marine life. Boat trips from Hurghada typically include multiple snorkel stops and equipment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the best area to explore in Hurghada?</h3>
                    <p>Ad-Dahar (El Dahar), the old town, offers authentic Egyptian atmosphere with traditional souks, local restaurants, and the historic Coptic church. Sigala has the modern marina and waterfront promenade. Both are accessible from the cruise port.</p>

                    <h3>Is Hurghada safe for tourists?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, Hurghada is generally safe. It's a major tourist destination with visible security. Use common sense—watch your belongings in crowded areas, use reputable tour operators, and be cautious with unsolicited offers. The resort areas and marine parks are very safe.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need to book excursions in advance?</h3>
                    <p>For popular trips like Giftun Islands or Luxor, booking ahead is wise, especially during winter high season. Desert safaris and beach clubs can often be booked the day before or morning of your visit.</p>

                    Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake—charts drawn from research, captain's wisdom, and the accounts of fellow travelers. I write them knowing that the truest understanding comes only when you stand on the pier, smell the salt air, and trace the streets with your own feet. When my anchor finally drops here, I'll return to these pages and tell you what I found.
