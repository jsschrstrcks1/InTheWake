Proceeding north, and then east, Tasman came to present day Golden Bay, where he anchored his two ships. One of the ships was attacked by Ngati Tumatakokiri Maori. Four of Tasman's men, and several Maori were killed in the altercation. Tasman named the bay Murderers Bay, and sailed north, mistaking Cook Strait for a bight, naming it Zeehaen's Bight. Two names Tasman gave to New Zealand landmarks still endure - Cape Maria van Diemen, and Three Kings Island. Tasman is also responsible for the name New Zealand (Nieuw Zeeland).\n</p><p>Tasman was a Dutch seafarer, explorer and merchant, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (United East India Company).
