        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>I woke to Mount Etna smoking on the horizon — a 3,300-meter volcano so close I could see fresh black lava flows scarring her flanks. This is Europe's highest and most active volcano, and she dominates everything here. The Chalcidian Greeks who settled this coast in 729 BC knew exactly what they were doing: they built their city at the foot of a goddess who breathes fire. Romans came, then Byzantines, then Saracens, then Normans — each culture leaving their mark in stone and street plan. But Etna had the final word, always.</p>

          <p>We caught the cable car up the mountain at first light, then switched to a four-wheel-drive bus that climbed switchbacks through black volcanic moonscapes. By 9:30 we stood at 2,900 meters wearing jackets in July, staring into craters that last erupted mere weeks before. The ground was warm under my boots. Steam vents hissed sulfur into cold mountain air. I looked down at the city spread below — grey and compact against the Ionian Sea — and understood viscerally what happened in 1669 when Etna erupted for months, burying half the city under rivers of molten rock. Then came 1693: an earthquake so violent it leveled what Etna had spared.</p>

          <p>But here's what moves me: they rebuilt. Not just rebuilt — they reimagined their city entirely. Architect Giovanni Battista Vaccarini led the transformation, designing churches and palazzos in the grandest Sicilian Baroque style. And they built everything from the volcano's own stone — dense black lava that gives the entire city a dark, dignified beauty. Locals call it the "grey city" or "Black Baroque," and once you see it you understand. These aren't pale limestone facades; they're charcoal-dark walls that glow warm in sunlight and turn almost bronze at dusk. In 2002, UNESCO recognized what any visitor already knows: this is one of the Late Baroque Towns of Val di Noto, a World Heritage treasure born from catastrophe.</p>

          <p>I descended from Etna and walked straight into the baroque heart. Piazza del Duomo opens like a theater set — all symmetry and grandeur. At its center stands <em>u Liotru</em>, the elephant fountain that's been Catania's symbol for centuries. Carved from black lava stone, the elephant bears an ancient Egyptian obelisk on its back, trunk raised toward Etna as if in conversation. Locals believe the elephant has protective powers, that it can calm the volcano's temper. I stood there watching water cascade over dark stone and thought about faith — not just in God but in place, in rebuilding, in choosing to stay even when the mountain speaks.</p>

          <p>The Catania Cathedral anchors the piazza's eastern edge, its baroque facade a masterwork of columns and saints sculpted in that distinctive grey-black stone. The original cathedral was built in the 11th century, but the earthquake reduced it to rubble. What stands now is the 17th-century resurrection — grander, more ornate, defiant. Inside, the air is cool and dim, and you can still see fragments of the Norman structure incorporated into new walls. I lit a candle and sat in a back pew, listening to the echo of footsteps on marble. Centuries of prayers have soaked into this stone.</p>

          <p>Just north of the center, I found the Monastery of San Nicolò l'Arena — one of the largest monasteries in all of Europe and another UNESCO site. The complex is massive: cloisters, libraries, kitchens built to feed hundreds of monks. Parts date to the 16th century, though Etna and the earthquake forced repeated reconstruction. Today it houses the University of Catania's humanities department, and I wandered courtyards where students sprawled on benches reading Dante under lemon trees. The sacred and the scholarly share the same lava-stone walls.</p>

          <p>By early afternoon hunger drove me to La Pescheria, the fish market that sprawls behind Piazza del Duomo. This is not a tourist attraction pretending to be authentic — this is the real thing, raw and loud and glorious. Swordfish heads the size of watermelons lay on ice, octopus tentacles draped over wooden tables, sea urchins piled in spiny pyramids. Vendors shouted prices in Sicilian dialect so thick I caught maybe one word in five. The whole scene smelled of seawater and lemons and the Ionian Sea itself. I bought arancini still hot from the fryer at a stand with no name — just a woman, a pot of boiling oil, and a line of locals who'd been coming here for thirty years. The rice ball was stuffed with ragù and peas, the crust so crispy it shattered at first bite. I ate standing up, grease on my fingers, completely happy. The moment that stays with me: that first bite of arancini, still burning my tongue, while vendors shouted in Sicilian and sunlight slanted through the awnings — this was Italy unfiltered, and I was exactly where I wanted to be.</p>

          <p>I spent the rest of the afternoon simply walking. Via Etnea runs straight as a rifle shot from the waterfront toward the volcano, and every cross-street reveals some baroque church or palazzo you hadn't expected. The city is compact, walkable, lived-in. This isn't Taormina's polished tourist elegance — Catania is grittier, more real, more itself. Laundry hangs from wrought-iron balconies. Espresso bars serve locals in undershirts reading <em>La Gazzetta dello Sport</em>. Motor scooters weave through traffic with cheerful disregard for lanes. It's Sicily as it actually is, not as the postcards pretend.</p>

          <p>Back on the ship that evening, I watched Etna's silhouette fade to purple against a tangerine sky, and I thought about what draws people to build cities in the shadow of destruction. The answer, I think, is the same force that draws us to the sea: a recognition that the most beautiful places carry risk, and that living fully means accepting the terms. Catania has been destroyed — by volcano, earthquake, plague, and war — and every time she rises from the ash more beautiful than before.</p>

          <p>What I learned from Catania taught me something I didn't expect: faith isn't believing nothing bad will happen. Faith is rebuilding in black stone and calling it home. It's the arancini vendor who kept coming back after the eruption, the architects who turned catastrophe into UNESCO beauty, the students reading Dante in monastery courtyards their ancestors rebuilt. Catania reminded me that the best things in life are worth the risk, and that true resilience means not just surviving destruction but creating something more beautiful from the ashes. That lesson, written in lava across this city's baroque facades, will stay with me long after this voyage ends.</p>

      <details class="port-section cruise_port" open>
        <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
        <p>Catania's cruise terminal sits at the city's eastern edge, about 2 km from the historic baroque center. The port handles both cruise ships and commercial traffic, but cruise passengers have a dedicated terminal area with modern facilities. Ships dock at dedicated cruise berths with gangways leading directly to the terminal building. Inside you'll find tourist information, taxi stands, and local tour operators.</p>
        <p>The terminal area is functional rather than scenic — this is a working port. However, the walk into town follows the waterfront and becomes increasingly attractive as you approach the historic center. Shuttle buses and taxis wait at the terminal. Most cruise lines offer shuttle service to Piazza del Duomo for around €8-10 roundtrip. Taxis charge approximately €15-20 for the same journey. For Mount Etna excursions, most tour buses depart directly from the cruise terminal area between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="port-section getting_around" open>
        <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
        <p>Port to baroque center is 2 km — an easy 25-minute walk along the waterfront or a quick taxi ride (€15-20). The historic center itself is wonderfully compact and entirely walkable. Mount Etna tours depart directly from the cruise terminal, most leaving between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. to maximize crater time before afternoon clouds roll in. The Circumetnea cable car (Funivia dell'Etna) operates from Rifugio Sapienza at 1,900 meters elevation, lifting passengers to 2,500 meters in approximately 15 minutes. This is genuinely good value for money — the views alone justify the ticket price.</p>
        <p>From the cable car station, authorized 4WD buses take visitors to the crater zones around 2,900-3,000 meters elevation. Independent hiking is possible on lower slopes, but crater access requires certified guides for safety and environmental protection reasons. Public AMT buses run from the port area to Piazza del Duomo every 20 minutes throughout the day; the ride takes about 10 minutes and costs just €1 — remarkable value for convenient transportation. For wheelchair users, the baroque center has some cobblestone streets but the main piazzas are accessible. Book ahead for accessible Etna tours as standard vehicles cannot accommodate wheelchairs. Ramp-accessible taxis are available with advance reservation.</p>

        <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
        <p>Catania offers two world-class experiences: Mount Etna and the UNESCO baroque city. Both can be done independently or through ship excursions with guaranteed return to the vessel.</p>

        <h3>Mount Etna Summit Tour</h3>
        <p>The signature Catania experience and absolutely worth prioritizing. Ship excursions ($120-180 USD) include transportation to Rifugio Sapienza at 1,900 meters, cable car ascent to 2,500 meters, and authorized 4WD bus to the crater zones near the summit. Total tour time: 6-7 hours including transit. Independent travelers can book ahead through Funivia dell'Etna directly (cable car €35, 4WD €30) or hire a private guide ($200-300 USD for small groups). Morning departures are essential — afternoon clouds frequently obscure the craters and diminish the experience. Dress in warm layers: sea level temperatures might reach 25°C while the summit hovers near 5°C even in summer. Closed-toe shoes with ankle support are mandatory for crater hiking. This excursion rates high stamina level.</p>

        <h3>Taormina Day Trip</h3>
        <p>The famous hilltop town lies 50 km north (approximately 1 hour by road depending on traffic). Ship excursions typically combine Taormina with scenic Etna views ($150-200 USD). Independent visitors can take SAIS buses from Catania center (€5 each way, about 90 minutes) but timing becomes tight for a cruise port day — carefully verify return bus schedules before committing. The ancient Greek Theater with its Etna backdrop and elegant Corso Umberto shopping street are the highlights worth your time. Book ahead during peak cruise season as tours fill quickly. Moderate stamina level with significant walking on steep streets.</p>

        <h3>Walking Tour of Baroque Catania</h3>
        <p>Self-guided walks are simple and rewarding in this compact city. Start at Piazza del Duomo to admire the elephant fountain and cathedral facade, continue to Via dei Crociferi (the magnificent baroque church street with four churches in 200 meters), and finish at the Monastery of San Nicolò l'Arena. Ship excursions offer guided versions ($60-80 USD) that typically include cathedral interior access and historical commentary. Independent walking takes 2-3 hours at a comfortable pace with photo stops. La Pescheria fish market operates mornings only — arrive before 11:00 a.m. for the authentic experience. Low stamina level on mostly flat terrain.</p>

        <h3>Syracuse Day Trip</h3>
        <p>The ancient Greek city of Syracuse lies 60 km south. Ship excursions ($100-140 USD) visit the archaeological park featuring one of the best-preserved Greek theaters in existence, plus the charming island of Ortygia with its baroque cathedral and waterfront cafés. Independent travel via train is possible but requires careful timing and coordination. Syracuse genuinely deserves a full day — consider this option only if your ship allows 8+ hours in port. Moderate stamina level with considerable walking on uneven ancient surfaces.</p>

        <p><strong>Arancini:</strong> Sicily's famous fried rice balls. In Catania, they're traditionally conical (not round like Palermo's version) and stuffed with ragù, peas, and mozzarella. Best from market stands and old-school friggitorie where they're made fresh. €1.50-3 each.</p>
        <p><strong>Pasta alla Norma:</strong> Catania's signature pasta — named for native composer Bellini's opera. Rigatoni with fried eggplant, tomato sauce, ricotta salata, and fresh basil. Every trattoria has its own version. €8-12.</p>
        <p><strong>Fresh Seafood at La Pescheria:</strong> The fish market doubles as an eating destination. Surrounding stalls sell grilled swordfish steaks, fried calamari, and sea urchin pasta prepared to order. Eat standing at communal tables amid the chaos. €10-20 for a memorable feast.</p>
        <p><strong>Granita con Brioche:</strong> The Sicilian breakfast of champions. Slushy fruit ice (almond, pistachio, coffee, or lemon) served with a soft brioche for dipping. €3-5 at any bar. Non-negotiable morning experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Cannoli:</strong> Crispy fried pastry tubes filled with sweet ricotta. In Catania they're often studded with pistachios from nearby Bronte. €2-4 each. Only eat them freshly filled — never pre-made.</p>

        <p><strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong> Mount Etna is continuously active. Minor eruptions and increased activity can close crater access without warning. Cable car and summit tours operate based on daily volcanic conditions. Eruptions rarely affect Catania city itself — the volcano's typical activity poses no danger to cruise visitors in town.</p>
        <p><strong>Summer Heat:</strong> July and August temperatures regularly exceed 35°C (95°F) in the city. Start exploring early, seek shade during midday, and carry water. The baroque center has limited air-conditioned spaces — churches provide the coolest respite.</p>
        <p><strong>Siesta Hours:</strong> Many shops and smaller restaurants close 1:00-4:00 p.m. Plan lunch before 1:00 p.m. or after 4:00 p.m. La Pescheria fish market closes by early afternoon — don't arrive late.</p>

        <p class="soundings-intro">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <p>Arrive at La Pescheria before 11:00 a.m. — the fish market winds down by noon and is nearly empty by 1:00 p.m. For Etna excursions, dress in layers even in summer; it can be 25°C at sea level and 5°C at the summit craters. Closed-toe shoes with good grip are mandatory for crater hikes. Sunglasses and sunscreen are essential year-round due to altitude and reflection off volcanic rock and snow patches.</p>
        <p>The UNESCO baroque center is wonderfully compact and walkable — you can stroll from Piazza del Duomo to the Monastery of San Nicolò l'Arena in under 10 minutes. Teatro Massimo Bellini, Catania's grand opera house named for the native composer, sometimes offers morning tours; check ahead if you appreciate operatic history. The Elephant Fountain and Cathedral exterior are always accessible. Cash remains useful at the fish market and small cafés. ATMs cluster around Piazza del Duomo and Via Etnea. English is spoken at tourist sites but less common at authentic market stalls — a few Italian phrases earn appreciation and better service.</p>

        <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Can you see Mount Etna from Catania cruise port?</strong><br/>Yes — on clear mornings Etna dominates the entire skyline right from the ship's deck. The volcano stands only 30 km away and organized tours depart directly from the port terminal.</p>
        <p><strong>Is the fish market worth visiting in Catania?</strong><br/>Absolutely — La Pescheria remains one of the most vibrant and authentic markets anywhere in Italy. Arrive before 11:00 a.m. for the full sensory experience of swordfish, octopus, sea urchins, and genuine local color. The surrounding stalls serve excellent cooked meals.</p>
        <p><strong>How far is Catania's baroque center from the cruise terminal?</strong><br/>About 2 km — a pleasant 25-minute walk along the waterfront or a quick taxi ride costing €15-20. Piazza del Duomo with the elephant fountain marks the heart of the UNESCO baroque district.</p>
        <p><strong>What should I wear for a Mount Etna excursion from Catania?</strong><br/>Dress in layers — sea level might be 20°C while summit temperatures hover around 5°C even in summer. Closed-toe shoes with ankle support are required for crater hikes. Pack sunglasses and sunscreen regardless of cloud cover below.</p>
        <p><strong>Is Catania better than Messina for Sicily cruise stops?</strong><br/>They offer different strengths rather than being directly comparable. Messina provides easier access to Taormina, while Catania delivers authentic city life, closer proximity to Etna's summit, and the remarkable baroque UNESCO center. Both serve as excellent Sicily gateways depending on your priorities.</p>
