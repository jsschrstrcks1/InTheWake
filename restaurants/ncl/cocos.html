      <h3>Coco's Review: Tropical Drinks in a Beachy Setting</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Coco's is a tropical-themed bar found on select Norwegian ships, serving island-inspired cocktails in a beach-bar setting. It's positioned as a step up from the pool bar in terms of cocktail variety, though still firmly casual. Drinks are standard pricing or covered by the beverage package.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The tropical menu is the draw here. The Coco Loco (coconut rum, coconut cream, pineapple, lime) is the house specialty and it's genuinely good — creamy without being cloying. The Painkiller is another strong choice: dark rum, pineapple, orange, coconut cream, with a nutmeg dusting. The Blue Lagoon is for Instagram more than flavor. Beyond the tropicals, it's the same NCL bar menu you've seen everywhere. Draft beer is ice-cold, which matters when you're sitting in the sun. The fruit garnishes are fresh. Ask for "less sweet" on any frozen drink — it makes a noticeable difference.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Service is casual and friendly — the bartenders lean into the island vibe and are generally enthusiastic about the tropical menu. Speed is good; the bar doesn't get as overwhelmed as the main pool bar. During sea days, expect a short wait but nothing excessive. The staff will customize sweetness levels if you ask, which is a nice touch.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Tiki torches (LED, not real), bamboo accents, palm-leaf décor, and rattan seating — Coco's commits to the island bar aesthetic. It's a step above the pool bar in terms of vibe: more relaxed, slightly fewer kids, better seating. On Bliss and Breakaway, it's tucked away enough to feel like a discovery. The music leans reggae and steel drum, played at conversation-friendly volume. Sunset hours are the sweet spot — the tropical décor actually matches the ocean views. The seats fill up during Caribbean itineraries, so grab one early on sea days.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5.</strong> Coco's delivers a fun tropical bar experience — the Coco Loco and Painkiller are worth seeking out, and the beachy atmosphere is a nice escape from the main bar scene. It's limited by the same fleet-wide beer and wine list, and the non-tropical drinks are nothing special. <em>Tip:</em> Ask for your cocktail "less sweet" — the bartenders are used to this request and it improves most tropical drinks significantly.</p>
