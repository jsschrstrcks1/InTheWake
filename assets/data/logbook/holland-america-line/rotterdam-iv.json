      "markdown": "**SS Rotterdam IV launched in 1908 as Holland America Line's most ambitious ship yet—the flagship that would represent Dutch maritime excellence for three decades.**\n\nAt 24,149 gross tons, Rotterdam IV was large for her era, designed to compete with German and British rivals for prestigious transatlantic traffic. She offered the luxury that first-class passengers expected while accommodating emigrants in lower decks.\n\nThe ship served as HAL's flagship through the prosperous years before World War I, through the conflict itself, through the 1920s boom, and into the Depression. Her longevity testified to quality construction and careful maintenance.\n\nRotterdam IV represented Dutch engineering pride—proof that the Netherlands could build world-class ocean liners. The ship carried that national identity across the Atlantic.\n\nFor flagship history: Rotterdam IV defined HAL during its most confident era. The ship embodied Dutch maritime achievement at its peak.",

      "markdown": "**SS Rotterdam IV navigated both World Wars—avoiding the fate that claimed so many passenger ships and serving in various capacities during conflict.**\n\nDuring World War I, the ship faced the dangers of submarine warfare and naval conflict. The Netherlands' neutrality offered some protection, but ocean travel remained hazardous. Rotterdam IV survived.\n\nThe interwar years brought prosperity and Atlantic traffic. The ship served her intended purpose—carrying passengers between Europe and America in relative luxury.\n\nWorld War II brought different challenges. The Netherlands fell to German occupation; HAL ships scattered worldwide. Rotterdam IV's wartime fate reflected the chaos that engulfed European shipping.\n\nFor wartime history: Rotterdam IV's survival through two global conflicts was achievement itself. Many contemporaries were lost; she endured.",

Each generation built a new Rotterdam to serve as fleet leader, embodying the company's highest standards and greatest ambitions.\n\nRotterdam IV followed Rotterdam I, II, and III in this succession. Each represented its era's technology and design. Each served as company flagship. Each connected HAL to its geographic and commercial origins.\n\nThe tradition would continue after Rotterdam IV. Future Rotterdams—V, VI, and beyond—would carry the same prestigious name into new eras of ocean travel.\n\nFor naming heritage: Rotterdam IV belonged to a lineage. The name connected her to predecessors and successors, placing each ship within company history.",
