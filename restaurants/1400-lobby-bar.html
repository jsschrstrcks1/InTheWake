      <h3>1400 Lobby Bar Review: Sophisticated Cocktails in the Heart of Icon</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> 1400 Lobby Bar quickly became our go-to spot for pre-dinner drinks and late-night nightcaps during our Icon of the Seas sailing. Located in the central atrium, it's perfectly positioned for people-watching while enjoying expertly crafted cocktails. The atmosphere is upscale but welcoming—think sophisticated lounge rather than stuffy bar.</p>

      <h4>Drinks</h4>
      <p>The bartenders here know their craft. I started with a classic Old Fashioned, which was made exactly to my preference after a brief conversation about bourbon choices. My partner ordered an Espresso Martini that she declared the best she'd had at sea. On subsequent visits, we explored the signature cocktails—each one thoughtfully constructed with quality ingredients. The whiskey selection is impressive, and the bartenders are happy to offer recommendations based on your preferences.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Service was attentive without being intrusive. The bartenders remembered our preferences after the first visit, which added a personal touch. Even during busy pre-dinner hours, we never waited long for drinks. The staff handled custom requests with enthusiasm—one bartender created an off-menu variation that became my cruise favorite.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The design is contemporary and elegant with comfortable seating options including bar stools and lounge chairs. The central location means there's always interesting activity to observe, but the bar maintains its own intimate feel. Lighting is warm and flattering. On some evenings, there's live music nearby that adds to the ambiance without overwhelming conversation.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>1400 Lobby Bar delivers exactly what you'd hope for in a sophisticated ship bar—quality drinks, skilled bartenders, elegant atmosphere, and convenient location. It's become essential to our Icon Class cruise experience. <strong>Rating: 4.5/5.</strong> Highly recommended for cocktail enthusiasts, couples, and anyone seeking refined bar service. Most drinks covered by the Deluxe Beverage Package make it excellent value.</p>
