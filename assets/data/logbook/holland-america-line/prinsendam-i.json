All 524 aboard survived.**\n\n[Prinsendam](/ships/holland-america-line/prinsendam-i.html) caught fire on October 4, 1980, during an Alaska cruise. The blaze grew uncontrollable in heavy seas. Captain Cornelius Wabeke made the decision to abandon ship.\n\nWhat followed became the largest maritime rescue in peacetime history. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters, Air Force aircraft, and passing vessels coordinated through atrocious weather. Every single passenger and crew member was saved.\n\nThe ship sank days later, but her people survived because of extraordinary courage and coordination. The rescue became case study in maritime emergency response.\n\n**The miracle:** Prinsendam's loss demonstrated that seamanship and courage can overcome disaster. The sinking that saved everyone.\n\nThose who survived remember the terror and the rescue. The crew that got everyone off, the responders who retrieved them.",

At about 400 passengers, she offered intimacy that larger ships couldn't match.\n\nHer Alaska voyages were popular. The small size accessed fjords and passages larger ships couldn't attempt. Passengers appreciated the personal attention the scale enabled.\n\nShe was simply a beloved ship doing what cruise ships do—carrying passengers to beautiful places, creating memories, building community.\n\n**The service:** Prinsendam deserves remembrance for what she was, not just how she ended. The elegant small ship that served before tragedy.\n\nThose who sailed her before 1980 remember the ship, not just the headlines. The experience that preceded the incident.",
