The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Czech Republic\">Czech Republic</a> had a heavy budget deficit by 22-09-2009. The banking situation still remains unbalanced, and major banking breakdowns are now limited thanks to the guaranty of public funds in the USA. The Euro-zone is still to recover, but generally hasn't been affected by such profound banking failures, with the exception of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Greece\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Spain\">Spain</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Belgium\">Belgium</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:UK\">UK</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Slovakia\">Slovakia</a> gave money to their folding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_bank\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:central bank\">central bank</a> on the 8th of December, 2009, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Norway\">Norway</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oil\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:oil\">oil</a> output fell in both 2009 and 2010. 40% of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Bosnia and Herzegovina\">Bosnians</a> were jobless in mid 2010.\n</p><p>Concerning the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Europe\">European</a> '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIIGS\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:PIIGS\">PIIGS</a>' countries shown on the map\u00a0: Consecutively to the severe crisis in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Greece\">Greece</a>, some speculation was made against other Euro-zone states, using the pejorative name of PIIGS (combination of the initials of Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) to increase the fear and the feelings of messiness these countries may give to many investors who only have an incomplete knowledge of their economy. If Ireland is most definitely in a difficult situation, Italy has strictly no reason to be compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Greece\">Greece</a>, with a deficit of less than a half of the Greek one. Although severely affected in terms of unemployment, Spain has already been through such situations in the past (most of the 80's and 90's) without any risk of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bankruptcy\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:bankruptcy\">bankruptcy</a>, and it is important to remember the actual deficit comes after years of positive balance. Thanks to this, the debt refund (interest included) represent, today, less in percentage in the annual budget for 2010, than it did in any of the last fifteen years. Besides, the failing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:UK\">UK</a> deserved more than any other to be associated with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/failed_state\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:failed state\">failed state</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Greece\">Greece</a>. But, apart from the questionable nicknames (may \"GUK\" sound less funny than \"PIIGS\"?), all this shows how much words and rumours can play important roles in a somewhat serious and full of severe consequences subject\u00a0: world economy. In any case, UK is indeed not far from Greece in terms of public debt, and surely more exposed than some of the so called \"PIIGS\". In conclusion, ridiculous rumours (\"France out of the Euro\", \"Spain bankruptcy\") and scurrilous nicknames (PIIGS) obviously helped speculation against the Euro-zone, by increasing the panic induced by the quite real and serious Greek crisis. It is however important to remember that Greece represents for the European Union hardly much more than Oklahoma for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:USA\">USA</a>, while in America, much weightier states than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Oklahoma\">Oklahoma</a>, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:California\">California</a>, are in very difficult situation too. In fact, this speculation against the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Euro\">Euro</a> allowed a side effect\u00a0: the purchase of huge amounts of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Dollars\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:US Dollars\">US Dollars</a> in a key moment of the crisis, giving at least some value to China's colossal reserves (almost exclusively in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Dollar\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:US Dollar\">US Dollars</a>) and allowing the USA to benefit from more time ahead, to carry on going through this crisis, in hope of an eventual true recovery (independent of public stimulus), which is the only viable option for the world's biggest economy to overcome its abyssal financial depression. Since 2008, the \"PIIGS\" strategy is just one of different attempts\u00a0: One of the most representative of the precedent rumours was in late 2008 and early 2009, about probable doom-like chain reactions in Eastern European countries, regarding local private banking failures (which, eventually, did not happen to be that bad)... Chile\u2018s economy shrank 4.5% in 2009 and Algeria\u2019s gas exports fell b 3.9% in 2009 due to reduced demand in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:EU\">EU</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Drought\">Drought</a> has hit some parts of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magreb\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Magreb\">Magreb</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Iberia\">Iberia</a> badly in 2009 and 2010. About 37.3 million (37,3000,000)  Americans, or about 12.5% of the population, were living in poverty during 2007 according to timesofoman.com.

Inevitably the crisis has affected all countries in region some ways, but certain countries were vastly affected more than others. \n</p><p>In Africa, between May 12th and 26th, both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Mauritania\">Mauritania</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal_River_drainage_basin\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River drainage basin\">S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River Area</a>  and neighbouring parts of both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Senegal\">Senegal</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Mali\">Mali</a> faced both a drought and famine in 2010.

Deloitte say Canadian consumers are increasing their debt-to-disposable-income ratios to more than 130% on February 04, 2009 and Canada\u2018s budget deficits totalled C$85 billion ($69 billion) over five years as the result of a recession and a C$40 billion two-year stimulus package packed with infrastructure spending, tax cuts and targeted loans by January 27, 2009. Poland's general government deficit widened to 7.1 percent of gross domestic product 2009, but slightly narrower than the government's estimate. By 29 July, 2009, Brazil\u2019s first-half nominal budget deficit index, including federal and local governments and state companies, widened to 43.7 billion Reais ($23 billion), the biggest gap since the modern records began in 2001. By the 18th January, 2010, Angola began to diversify it\u2019s economy and on the 15th of May, 2010, Angolan entrepreneurial activity remained low. Haiti\u2019s earthquake of 2010 had ruined the economy. In Singapore , the economy shrank by 2.1%  in 2009, but may grow by 4.5% to 6.5% in 2010. By March, 2010, Vietnam had spent 1% of it\u2019s GDP ($1billion) on subsidising the economy, but 5.32% growth seen likely by Vietnam for the whole of 2009.

Nigeria\u2019s economy is sadly being corrupted and in need restructuring reforms. Mauritania\u2019s economy is in need of restructuring reforms and fiscal discipline. Today, high oil revenues and a small population give Libya one of the highest GDPs per person in Africa and have allowed the Libyan state to provide an extensive level of social security, particularly in the fields of housing and education. Many problems still beset Libya's economy however; unemployment is the highest in the region at 21% according to the latest census figures. Pakistan would also receive a yearly loan from Japan worth $500 million from 2006 to 2011 to help develop I.T. usage. The name of the Central Bank of Nigeria has been used in a series of so-called 'Nigerian 419 Scams'. The fraudster sends an e-mail that appears to come from a Central Bank employee to millions of people saying the Bank has found an excess of money, or a debt owing to, a person or persons who have since died, and they wish to export it. The victim submits his own bank account so that the money may be placed therein, only to find that within a week his account is empty. The bank is in no way associated with such scams.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Mali\">Malian</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirgizia\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Kirgizia\">Kirgizian</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Burkina Faso\">Burkina Faso</a> organic cotton bucked the down turn in 2010, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a>'s hyper inflation reached 25,000% in 2009. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Taiwan\">Taiwan</a> was in recession as its economy contracted by a record 8.36%. by February 18, 2009.
