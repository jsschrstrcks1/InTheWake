        <h1>Lombok: What Bali Was Before the World Found It</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Lombok sits just across the Lombok Strait from Bali, close enough that you can see one island from the other on clear days, but they might as well be different worlds. Where Bali bustles with tour buses and selfie sticks, Lombok moves at the pace of rice-planting season. Where Bali's beaches overflow with sun loungers, Lombok's southern shores remain so empty you question whether you've discovered something you shouldn't share. This is Indonesia before mass tourism rewrote the script — rough-edged, generous, gloriously authentic.</p>

          <p>The island reveals itself in layers. There's Mount Rinjani looming over everything, Indonesia's second-highest volcano at 12,224 feet, its sacred crater lake gleaming like a turquoise secret. There are the Gili Islands offshore — three tiny specks where no cars exist, where horse-drawn carts clip-clop down sandy lanes and sea turtles drift through shallows like ancient philosophers. There's Sasak culture, woven into the island's fabric as literally as the traditional ikat textiles women create in hillside villages, their hands moving through patterns their grandmothers taught them.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting on the floor of a traditional Sasak home in Sade village, watching a woman weave ikat cloth on a wooden loom as chickens wandered freely through the bamboo structure. Her fingers moved without hesitation, pulling threads into patterns of indigo and rust. She spoke no English, I spoke no Sasak, but when she gestured for me to try, we both laughed at my clumsy attempts. Some things — hospitality, craft, shared humanity — need no translation. Her home had a dirt floor and a thatched roof, but her dignity was absolute.
          </div>

          <p>If you only have one day, the choice is impossible. The Gili Islands offer snorkeling among sea turtles and the strange peace of islands without engines. Senggigi Beach provides the easiest escape — white sand, calm water, beach warungs serving grilled fish so fresh it was swimming an hour ago. But the traditional Sasak villages — Sade, Ende, Rambitan — offer something rarer: a glimpse of village life that modernity hasn't erased. Watch women weave beneath stilted houses, see rice barns raised on stones to foil rats, taste palm wine tapped from lontar palms. Tourism exists here, but it hasn't yet consumed the culture it came to see.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Lembar Port (southwest coast) — working cargo/ferry port with basic facilities; 22 km from Senggigi</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Attractions:</strong> Senggigi Beach 30 min; Gili Islands require boat transfer (45 min-1 hr); southern beaches 45-60 min</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Indonesian Rupiah (IDR); ATMs in Senggigi and Mataram; USD sometimes accepted but rupiah preferred</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Sasak (local), Bahasa Indonesia (national); English limited outside tourist areas</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Left side; roads variable quality; scooter rental popular but challenging for beginners</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> April-October (dry season); November-March wetter with afternoon storms</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Gili Islands</h4>
          <p>Three car-free islands offshore — Gili Trawangan (backpacker party vibe), Gili Air (middle ground), Gili Meno (quietest). White sand, turquoise water, coral reefs, sea turtles. Snorkeling excellent. Fast boat from Bangsal Harbor (~45 min) or Senggigi. Full-day excursion recommended — too rushed for independent cruise-day visit. No motorized vehicles; cidomo horse carts only.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Traditional Sasak Villages</h4>
          <p>Sade, Ende, and Rambitan preserve traditional Sasak architecture — bamboo and thatch homes, elevated rice barns (lumbung), earthen floors. Women demonstrate weaving ikat cloth on backstrap looms. Cultural immersion, not museum performance. Small donation expected. Combine with southern beach visit. 45 minutes from Lembar. Modest dress required (shoulders, knees covered). Genuine, unhurried, profound.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mount Rinjani Viewpoints & Waterfalls</h4>
          <p>The full Rinjani trek takes 2-4 days, but Sendang Gile and Tiu Kelep waterfalls at the base offer accessible beauty — jungle trails, swimming holes, volcanic vistas. 2-3 hours from port. Half-day tours available. Wear good shoes; trails slippery after rain. The waterfalls cascade through rainforest with Rinjani towering above. Cool, shaded, spiritually refreshing.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Senggigi Beach</h4>
          <p>Lombok's main tourist beach — crescent bay, calm water, beachfront restaurants, sunset views toward Bali. Less developed than Bali's beaches. Good swimming, snorkeling at north end. 30 minutes from Lembar. Easy half-day option. Beach warungs serve fresh seafood, cold Bintang beer, coconuts. Relaxed, accessible, unpretentious.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pink Beach (Pantai Merah)</h4>
          <p>One of only seven pink-sand beaches worldwide — sand tinted coral-pink from crushed red coral. Remote southeastern coast near Tanjung Ringgit. Dramatic cliffs, turquoise water, excellent snorkeling. 90 minutes from Lembar over rough roads. Requires full-day commitment or organized tour. Bring snorkel gear, sun protection, water. Wild, pristine, worth the journey.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pura Lingsar Temple</h4>
          <p>Unique temple complex blending Hindu, Buddhist, and indigenous Wektu Telu beliefs — reflection of Lombok's multicultural heritage. Holy spring, ornate shrines, sacred eels fed by devotees. 30 minutes from Lembar. Sarong required (available for rent). Quiet contemplation. Demonstrates Lombok's syncretic spirituality. Brief visit adds cultural depth.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at Lembar Port; negotiate fare before departure (no meters). Expect 200,000-300,000 IDR (~$13-20 USD) to Senggigi, more for distant destinations. Agree on price, waiting time, return trip upfront.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Most practical for cruise passengers — handle transportation, timing, multiple stops. Book through ship or reputable local operators. Shore excursions expensive but eliminate logistics stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Driver:</strong> Hire for the day (500,000-700,000 IDR / ~$32-45 USD). Flexible itinerary, local knowledge, easier than navigating yourself. Arrange at port or in advance online.</li>
            <li><strong>Scooter Rental:</strong> Popular with backpackers (~50,000 IDR/day) but risky for unfamiliar riders. Traffic chaotic, roads rough, helmets mandatory. Not recommended for cruise day unless experienced.</li>
            <li><strong>Cidomo:</strong> Horse-drawn carts in villages and Gili Islands. Charming, slow, practical for short distances. Negotiate fare first.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ayam Taliwang:</strong> Lombok's signature dish — grilled chicken marinated in spicy chili, garlic, tomato sauce. Fiery and addictive. Served with plecing kangkung (water spinach salad).</li>
            <li><strong>Plecing Kangkung:</strong> Water spinach blanched and tossed with spicy tomato sambal, lime, shrimp paste. Fresh, bright, tongue-tingling heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Sate Pusut:</strong> Minced fish satay grilled over coconut husk coals. Smoky, slightly sweet, uniquely Sasak. Street vendors sell them everywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Beberuk Terong:</strong> Grilled eggplant mashed with fiery sambal, shrimp paste, lime. Humble, intense, perfect with rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Nasi Balap Puyung:</strong> Coconut rice with shredded chicken, peanuts, boiled egg, fried soybeans. Sasak comfort food, explosively spicy.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuak &amp; Arak:</strong> Palm wine (tuak, sweet and milky) and distilled arak (potent rice/palm liquor). Local moonshine — proceed cautiously.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Coconuts:</strong> Served ice-cold at beaches. Refreshing, hydrating, cheap (~10,000 IDR). Drink the water, eat the flesh.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lombok is predominantly Muslim (95%) — dress modestly outside beach areas (cover shoulders, knees). Temples require sarongs.</li>
            <li>Learn basic Bahasa: "terima kasih" (thank you), "berapa harganya?" (how much?), "maaf" (sorry/excuse me). Locals appreciate effort.</li>
            <li>Bargaining expected at markets, with drivers, for souvenirs. Start at 50-60% of asking price, negotiate with smiles. Not for restaurant bills.</li>
            <li>Bring small rupiah bills (20,000, 50,000) — vendors often lack change. ATMs available in Senggigi and Mataram.</li>
            <li>The Gili Islands are beautiful but time-consuming from Lembar Port — book shore excursion or skip for closer destinations.</li>
            <li>Roads can be rough, especially to southern beaches. Motion-sickness-prone travelers should medicate before departure.</li>
            <li>Sambal (chili paste) accompanies every meal — it's genuinely spicy. Taste cautiously before dousing your plate.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen, hat, water bottle essential — tropical sun fierce, shade scarce at beaches and villages.</li>
            <li>Photography permitted in villages but ask permission for close-ups of people. Small tip (10,000-20,000 IDR) appreciated.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Author's Note</h3>
          <p class="disclaimer-text"><em>Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake—gathered from travelers I trust, charts I've studied, and the most reliable accounts I can find. I've done my best to triangulate the truth, but firsthand observation always reveals what even the best research can miss. When I finally drop anchor here, I'll return to these pages and correct my course.</em></p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Lombok?</strong><br/>A: Lembar Port on the southwest coast, about 22 km (30 min drive) from Senggigi Beach. It's a working port with basic facilities. Taxis and tour operators meet ships.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Can I visit the Gili Islands on a cruise day?</strong><br/>A: Possible but tight. Fast boats from Bangsal or Senggigi take 15-45 minutes. Travel time eats your day. Book organized shore excursion — they handle logistics and timing. Independent visit risky for port-day schedule.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Is Mount Rinjani climbable in one day?</strong><br/>A: No. The full summit trek takes 2-4 days with camping. But you can visit waterfalls at the base (Sendang Gile, Tiu Kelep) or viewpoints on a half-day tour.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: How does Lombok differ from Bali?</strong><br/>A: Less developed, more authentically Indonesian. Predominantly Muslim vs. Hindu. Fewer tourists, rougher infrastructure, lower prices. More village culture, less nightlife. Bali's quieter, grittier neighbor.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: What currency should I bring?</strong><br/>A: Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). ATMs available in Senggigi and Mataram. USD sometimes accepted but you'll get poor exchange rates. Bring small bills for vendors and drivers.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: Are Sasak villages respectful to visit?</strong><br/>A: Yes, if approached respectfully. Dress modestly (shoulders, knees covered), ask permission for photos, leave small donation (20,000-50,000 IDR). These are real communities, not theme parks. Genuine interest welcomed.</p>
