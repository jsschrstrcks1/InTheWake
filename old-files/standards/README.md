# In the Wake — Modular Standards v3.006 (Invocation Edition)
**Release Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Compiled:** 2025-10-10T21:56:19.048251

This Invocation Edition consolidates all active modular standards under a unified, reverent framework.
Each file has been reread, audited, and aligned with the invocation principle:
> *“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.”* — Colossians 3:23  
> *“Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.”* — Proverbs 3:5

## Structure
- `00-core/` — applies to all pages and shared behavior
- `10-hub/` — for index and hub-style pages
- `20-modules/` — for feature pages (ships, restaurants, etc.)
- `CHANGELOG.md` — detailed version tracking
- `README.md` — invocation statement and project summary

## Invocation Reminder
All standards are to be reread, prayed over, and reaffirmed at least once per day,
and every time the project is reopened.

**Soli Deo Gloria.**
