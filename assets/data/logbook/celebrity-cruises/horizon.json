      "markdown": "**Every cruise line starts somewhere. Celebrity started with Horizon.**\n\n[Horizon](/ships/celebrity-cruises/horizon.html) launched in 1990 as Celebrity Cruises's first ship. The vessel that began everything. Before Horizon, Celebrity was an idea. After Horizon, Celebrity was real.\n\nAt 1,354 passengers, Horizon established what Celebrity would mean. The commitment to premium experience. The focus on elegance over excess. The belief that cruising could attract travelers who'd never considered it.\n\nEvery ship that followed—every Century Class, every Millennium Class, every Solstice and Edge—traces lineage to Horizon. She was patient zero for Celebrity's identity.\n\n**The truth:** Horizon represents Celebrity's absolute origin. The first ship. The beginning of everything.\n\nThose who sailed Horizon witnessed a line being born. The ship that made Celebrity possible.",

The dining program that seemed ambitious for 1990. The service philosophy that felt revolutionary.\n\n'This is different from other cruise ships,' early passengers observed.\n\n'This is what we're creating,' the young line replied.\n\nHorizon's innovations—the culinary focus, the elegant design, the service attention—became Celebrity's DNA. What seemed pioneering on Horizon became standard throughout the fleet.\n\n**The truth:** Horizon established Celebrity's identity. The standards invented here became the baseline for everything after.\n\nThose who sailed Horizon early were witnessing experimentation. The ship where Celebrity discovered what it would mean.",

The first ship leaving meant the founding era concluding. Everything that followed owed existence to Horizon.\n\n'Without this ship, none of the others exist,' one passenger observed.\n\n'This ship made Celebrity real,' another agreed.\n\n**The truth:** Horizon's departure removed the genesis ship. Every Celebrity vessel sails because Horizon proved the concept could work.\n\nThose who loved Horizon remember her as origin. The ship that made everything possible.",
