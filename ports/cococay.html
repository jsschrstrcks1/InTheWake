    <!-- First-Person Logbook Entry -->
    <article class="card logbook-entry">
      <h2>My CocoCay Logbook</h2>

      <p>I've lost count of how many times I've visited Perfect Day at CocoCay now — six? seven? — but I remember the first time with crystal clarity. It was 2019, just months after Royal Caribbean's $250 million transformation was complete, and I was sailing on <a href="/ships/rcl/mariner-of-the-seas.html">Mariner of the Seas</a> out of Miami. The moment we rounded the island and I saw those impossibly turquoise waters and the towering waterslides of Thrill Waterpark rising against the sky, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I'd been to plenty of private islands before, but nothing prepared me for this.</p>

      <p>The ship docked directly at the pier — no tenders, no waiting, just walk off and you're there. That alone sets CocoCay apart from most Caribbean ports. Within minutes I had my toes in the sand at Chill Island, a complimentary Coco Loco in hand (the frozen drinks here are dangerously good), staring at water so clear I could see fish swimming twenty feet out. The beaches are immaculate — raked daily, with free loungers and umbrellas scattered across multiple zones so you never feel crowded even on two-ship days.</p>

      <p>But let me tell you about Thrill Waterpark, because it's the headline attraction for good reason. I'm not normally a waterpark person, but when you're standing at the top of Daredevil's Peak — 135 feet up, the tallest waterslide in North America — looking out over the entire island with your heart pounding, you realize Royal Caribbean wasn't messing around with this investment. The drop slide is pure adrenaline, but my personal favorite is the Dueling Demons mat racers where you and three friends can compete side by side. The wave pool is massive and legitimate (none of that gentle ripple nonsense), and kids under a certain age have entire aqua playgrounds to themselves. We spent four hours in Thrill Waterpark on my last visit and still didn't do everything.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> It was late afternoon on my third visit, floating in Oasis Lagoon with my wife, swim-up bar cocktails in hand, watching the sun start to paint the sky orange behind our ship docked at the pier. A steel drum band was playing somewhere in the distance. Neither of us said anything for the longest time — we didn't need to. That's when I understood what Royal Caribbean was really selling here: not just a private island, but the closest thing to perfection a single day can hold. The water was exactly body temperature. The drink was exactly sweet enough. The music was exactly far enough away to be ambient. I've chased that feeling on every visit since.
      </div>

      <p>Oasis Lagoon deserves its own paragraph because it's genuinely incredible — the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean, they claim, and I believe it. It's massive. There's a swim-up bar, floating loungers, a DJ playing poolside, and multiple depth zones so families can share the space safely. I've spent entire port days just here without touching the beach, and that says something. The Coco Beach Club infinity pool is even more luxurious if you book that experience — overwater cabanas, dedicated servers, upscale lunch included — but Oasis Lagoon is free and fantastic.</p>

      <p>The food situation has improved dramatically since the early days. Skipper's Grill serves legitimately good BBQ (the ribs disappear fast at lunch — go early), and Chill Grill covers burgers, hot dogs, and all the sides you'd expect. It's all complimentary. Snack Shack has pizza and chicken tenders for picky eaters. If you upgrade to Coco Beach Club, the dining there is a significant step up — think resort-quality with table service. I've done both, and honestly, the free BBQ with a beach view is pretty hard to beat for value.</p>

      <p>The newer additions have only made things better. Hideaway Beach opened as an adults-only area with its own pool, quieter vibe, and dedicated bar — perfect if you're cruising without kids and want guaranteed peace. Up, Up and Away, the helium balloon that takes you 450 feet above the island, offers the most incredible photos and a completely unique perspective on the whole operation. The zip line across the island is solid fun (1,600 feet), though not as insane as the one at <a href="/ports/labadee.html">Labadee</a>.</p>

      <p>What I appreciate most about CocoCay is that it respects your time. There are no aggressive vendors, no hassle, no stress about getting back to the ship on time. Everything is within a 15-minute walk or a quick free tram ride. The paths are wide and flat and stroller-friendly. The signage is excellent. The app map actually works. You can be as active or as lazy as you want, and either choice feels like the right one. I've done full-on waterpark days and I've done "plant myself in a hammock and don't move for six hours" days, and both were perfect.</p>

      <p>The one thing I'd change? More shaded spots on the main beaches. On very sunny days, the prime shaded loungers get claimed early. But that's what cabana rentals are for, and even the basic cabanas (much cheaper than Coco Beach Club) give you a guaranteed comfortable base. Or just head to South Beach or Chill Island early — plenty of palm trees.</p>

      <p>CocoCay has earned its reputation. The aggregate reviews from thousands of cruisers across Cruise Critic, Reddit, and post-cruise surveys consistently put it at 4.8–5.0 stars, and I understand why. It's the private island experience perfected — Royal Caribbean threw an extraordinary amount of money and thought at this place, and it shows in every detail. From the moment you walk off the ship to the moment you reluctantly walk back on, everything just works.</p>

    <!-- Navigation Section -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Getting Around CocoCay</h3>
      <p>One of the easiest ports you'll ever navigate. Your ship docks directly at the private pier — walk off the gangway and you're on the island within minutes. Everything is connected by wide, flat paved paths and free trams that run constantly throughout the day.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From pier to Thrill Waterpark:</strong> 5–10 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">approximately 6 football fields, 24 blue whales end-to-end, or 528 emperor penguins stacked skyward</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Oasis Lagoon:</strong> 7–8 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">roughly 6 football fields, 24 blue whales in a row, or 528 emperor penguins forming an improbable tower</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Chill Island beaches:</strong> 10–12 minute walk <span class="distance-fun">approximately 10 football fields, 35 blue whales end-to-end, or 770 emperor penguins balancing precariously</span></li>
        <li><strong>From pier to Hideaway Beach (farthest point):</strong> 15 minutes on foot <span class="distance-fun">roughly 13 football fields, 49 blue whales in a parade, or 1,066 emperor penguins forming a questionable Jenga game</span> or 5 by tram</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Signage is excellent throughout, and the free Royal Caribbean app map makes orientation effortless. Tram stops are clearly marked and air-conditioned.</p>

      <p>On busy days with two or three ships in port, the island buzzes with fantastic energy — embrace it as an opportunity to people-watch, soak up the vibrant atmosphere, and feel the collective joy of thousands of happy cruisers while still finding plenty of quiet corners (head to South Beach or Chill Island early for prime shaded spots). Booking cabanas or waterpark tickets in advance through the Cruise Planner simply guarantees you the best seats in this tropical playground.</p>
