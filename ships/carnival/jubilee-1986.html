<section><h3>The Swedish Sister</h3><p>Holiday came from Denmark. Jubilee came from Sweden. The Holiday Class had Nordic heritage. Kockums shipyard in Malmö built Jubilee with Swedish precision—attention to detail, quality materials, engineering rigor. Thirty-one years of service proved that construction quality. Ships face constant stress; Kockums built Jubilee to survive those stresses across three decades and four identities.</p></section>

<section><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Jubilee was neither first nor last—she was the middle sister. Middle matters. Her legacy includes Swedish shipbuilding demonstration, Pacific market expansion through Pacific Sun, and thirty-one years proving Holiday Class durability. She showed that Fun Ship philosophy worked for Americans AND Australians AND Chinese passengers. The middle sister role suited her well across three decades of service.</p></section>
