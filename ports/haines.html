      <h2>Captain's Logbook</h2>

      <p>The ship pulled into Haines on a Tuesday morning, and I immediately noticed what was missing: crowds. After the tourist gauntlet of Juneau and Ketchikan, Haines felt like a deep breath of Alaskan air. The town has maybe 2,500 year-round residents, a handful of cruise ships per week instead of per day, and the kind of authentic frontier atmosphere that most Alaska ports have lost to jewelry stores and helicopter tours. I walked off the gangway and within 50 feet was standing alone on a quiet street watching ravens argue over something in a garbage can.</p>

      <p>We drove out to the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve first — 19 miles along the Haines Highway through absolutely stunning scenery. Our guide explained that while the massive eagle gatherings (over 3,000 birds) happen October through February during the late salmon run, we'd still see eagles in summer. She was right: within an hour I'd counted 47 bald eagles perched in cottonwood trees along the Chilkat River. We watched an adult swoop down to pluck a salmon from the water, then carry it to a gravel bar to eat while ravens waited hopefully nearby. The preserve protects 48,000 acres specifically for eagle habitat — nowhere else in the world hosts this concentration of these magnificent birds.</p>

      <p>Fort William H. Seward is a short walk from downtown — a collection of historic white clapboard buildings arranged around a parade ground, built in 1904 as Alaska's first permanent military post. The fort was decommissioned after WWII and the buildings sold to veterans and artists. Today it's an eclectic mix of galleries, a brewery, the Alaska Indian Arts workshop where Tlingit master carvers create totem poles, and even a trapeze school. I watched a carver working on a raven clan house post — cedar chips curling under his adze — and he invited me to run my hand along the grain. He's been carving for 40 years and his work ends up in museums worldwide, but here he sits in an old Army barracks, carving and chatting with whoever walks in. Although many ports feature Native art, this felt different — these weren't assembly-line tourist pieces but genuine cultural expression happening right before my eyes.</p>

      <p>Lunch was at the Bamboo Room — a locals' joint since 1953 where fishermen and artists share counter space. I had the halibut and chips ($18) while eavesdropping on a conversation about commercial fishing quotas. The pie is legendary (get the strawberry rhubarb, $7). However, unlike tourist-oriented restaurants at other ports, no one tried to upsell me on anything or rush me out. The pace here is slower, genuinely Alaskan, and refreshingly unpretentious.</p>

      <p>The afternoon hike up Battery Point Trail offered views across Lynn Canal to the Chilkat Range — snow-capped peaks even in August. The trail winds through old-growth forest thick with devil's club and blueberry bushes, emerging at a rocky point where we watched seals hauled out on distant rocks. Round trip is about 4 miles on well-maintained trail, easy for most fitness levels. I saw exactly two other hikers the entire time — the solitude was remarkable compared to the crowds at other ports.</p>

      <p>Downtown Haines is genuinely walkable — art galleries, an excellent bookstore, the Hammer Museum (yes, an entire museum of hammers, which is more interesting than it sounds), and shops selling Tlingit art that's actually made locally rather than imported from overseas. The American Bald Eagle Foundation museum ($15) has excellent dioramas and live eagles that can't survive in the wild. I spent an hour learning about eagle biology from a volunteer who clearly loved her job and answered every question with genuine enthusiasm.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at a pullout on the Chilkat River, completely alone, watching a bald eagle tear strips of salmon flesh while mountain peaks reflected in still water — and realizing this is what Alaska felt like before cruise ships made it a brand.
      </div>

      <p>The pros: authentic small-town Alaska atmosphere, world-class eagle viewing even in summer, excellent hiking, fascinating Fort Seward, friendly locals who actually have time to chat, and no cruise-ship crowds. The pace is slower and more genuine than anywhere else on the Inside Passage.</p>

      <p>The cons: fewer excursion options than bigger ports, limited shopping if you want mainstream souvenirs, and some services close early or have irregular hours. The eagle preserve is 19 miles away, so you need transportation to see the main attraction.</p>

      <p>Practical tips: Book the eagle preserve tour in advance through your cruise line ($85-150) or arrange a rental car to explore independently. Wear layers — weather changes fast. Bring binoculars for eagle spotting. Walk to Fort Seward and downtown rather than taking taxis. Try the local breweries (Haines Brewing Company makes excellent ales). And save room for pie at the Bamboo Room.</p>

    <section id="cruise_port" class="card">
      <h2>Cruise Port</h2>
      <p>Haines receives far fewer cruise ships than Juneau, Ketchikan, or Skagway — typically 3-5 ships per week during summer rather than 3-5 per day. This lower volume is intentional; the community has chosen quality of life over tourism dollars. The result is a port experience that feels more like visiting a real town than navigating a cruise-ship processing facility. When you step off the gangway, you're immediately in Haines rather than being funneled through a tourist corridor.</p>
      <p>The cruise dock is located at Port Chilkoot Dock, about 0.5 miles from downtown and 0.75 miles from Fort Seward. Most ships dock directly without tendering. The walk into town is flat and pleasant with mountain views; alternatively, a shuttle service runs for those who prefer not to walk. The pier area has basic facilities including restrooms and a visitor information kiosk where locals volunteer to answer questions.</p>
      <p>Ships typically stay 6-8 hours in Haines, which is enough time to do a major excursion plus explore downtown, or to do multiple shorter activities. The small-town atmosphere means you won't spend time waiting in lines. The town is wheelchair accessible with paved sidewalks downtown, though some hiking trails and Fort Seward's gravel parade ground may present challenges for mobility devices.</p>

    <section id="getting_around" class="card">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Haines is one of the most walkable cruise ports in Alaska. The town is compact, terrain is flat, and distances are short. Most visitors can comfortably walk between the dock, downtown, and Fort Seward without needing any form of transportation.</p>

      <h4>On Foot</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dock to Downtown:</strong> About 0.5 miles on flat, paved sidewalks. Pleasant 10-minute walk with mountain views.</li>
        <li><strong>Dock to Fort Seward:</strong> About 0.75 miles. Easy walk through quiet residential streets.</li>
        <li><strong>Downtown Area:</strong> Compact and fully walkable. Everything of interest is within 3-4 blocks of Main Street.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shuttle & Taxi</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Port Shuttle:</strong> Free or low-cost shuttle ($2-5) runs between the dock, downtown, and Fort Seward on cruise days.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxi Service:</strong> Local taxis available but limited; book in advance for guaranteed availability. Around $15-25 to major destinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Excursion Buses:</strong> Tour operators provide transportation to the eagle preserve and other distant attractions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Car Rental</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rental Agencies:</strong> Limited options available — book well in advance. Rates around $80-120/day.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Independent access to eagle preserve, Chilkoot Lake, and the scenic Haines Highway to the Canadian border.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Accessibility Note:</strong> Downtown sidewalks are paved and wheelchair accessible. Fort Seward's parade ground is gravel but manageable. Some hiking trails are not wheelchair accessible. Contact the visitor center for specific accessibility information on attractions.</p>

    <section id="excursions" class="card">
      <h2>Top Excursions</h2>
      <p>Haines excursions focus on wildlife, wilderness, and authentic Alaska culture. The town's smaller scale means fewer mega-tour options but more genuine experiences. Book ahead through your cruise line to guarantee spots, especially for the popular eagle preserve tours.</p>

      <h3>Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve</h3>
      <p>The signature Haines experience ($85-150, 2.5-3 hours) takes you 19 miles up the stunning Haines Highway to the 48,000-acre preserve — the world's largest bald eagle gathering site. Even in summer you'll typically see dozens of eagles along the Chilkat River, plus bears, moose, and other wildlife. Guides provide spotting scopes and expert interpretation. Ship excursion prices are typically 15-20% higher than booking with local operators, but include guaranteed return to ship.</p>

      <h3>Fort Seward & Tlingit Culture</h3>
      <p>Guided walking tours ($25-45, 1.5-2 hours) explore the historic Fort William H. Seward compound and include visits to Alaska Indian Arts, where master carvers create traditional Tlingit art. Watch totem pole carving demonstrations and learn about the cultural significance of clan symbols. Tours are accessible for those with mobility limitations on paved paths.</p>

      <h3>Chilkoot Lake & Salmon</h3>
      <p>Wildlife viewing excursions ($100-175, 3-4 hours) visit Chilkoot Lake State Recreation Site during salmon runs (July-September). Brown bears fish for salmon at the weir while eagles gather overhead. The setting is spectacular — glacial lake backed by snow-capped peaks. This is one of the most accessible places in Southeast Alaska to see brown bears fishing.</p>

      <h3>Hiking & Nature Walks</h3>
      <p>Guided nature walks ($40-75, 2-3 hours) explore trails like Battery Point, Mount Ripinsky, or the rainforest paths around town. For independent exploration, Battery Point Trail is excellent — 4-mile round trip with coastal views, starting from the cruise port area. Free trail maps available at the visitor center.</p>

      <h3>Flightseeing</h3>
      <p>Scenic flights ($200-350 per person, 1-1.5 hours) offer aerial views of Glacier Bay, the Chilkat Range, and the vast wilderness surrounding Haines. Some tours include glacier landings. Float planes depart from the harbor.</p>

      <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
      <p>Haines has fewer excursion options than larger ports, so popular tours can sell out. Book ahead through your cruise line when booking opens for guaranteed return to ship. Compare ship excursion prices with local operators like Chilkat Guides — local prices are typically lower, but you accept the risk of missing the ship if tours run late. For independent travelers, a rental car ($80-120/day) provides flexibility to explore the eagle preserve, Chilkoot Lake, and the scenic Haines Highway at your own pace.</p>

      <h2>Depth Soundings</h2>
      <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Everything you need to know before stepping ashore.</p>

      <h3>Weather & What to Bring</h3>
      <p>Haines weather is typical Southeast Alaska — unpredictable, often wet, and cooler than you'd expect in summer. Temperatures range 50-65°F (10-18°C) in summer months. Rain is common; pack waterproof layers and sturdy shoes.</p>

      <h4>Essential Gear</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rain gear:</strong> Waterproof jacket essential. Rain pants useful for longer hikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Temperature changes quickly; dress to add/remove layers throughout the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfortable walking shoes:</strong> You'll want to walk downtown and Fort Seward. Waterproof preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Binoculars:</strong> Essential for eagle watching and wildlife spotting at the preserve.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera with zoom:</strong> Eagles often perch at distance; 200mm+ lens helps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Useful Details</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> US Dollars. ATMs available downtown. Most businesses accept credit cards.</li>
        <li><strong>WiFi/Cell:</strong> Cell service is good in town; spotty at the eagle preserve. WiFi at cafes and the library.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Downtown is wheelchair accessible. Fort Seward parade ground is gravel. Some trails are not accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Services:</strong> Limited compared to larger ports. Some shops close early or have irregular hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Dial 911. Small clinic in town; serious emergencies may require evacuation to Juneau.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Costs & Tipping</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Meals:</strong> Halibut and chips $15-22, burgers $12-16, pie $6-8, local beer $6-8.</li>
        <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> 15-20% at restaurants, $10-15 per person for half-day tours.</li>
        <li><strong>Museums:</strong> American Bald Eagle Foundation $15, Hammer Museum $5.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> $15-25 around town. Book ahead — limited availability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't miss the Bamboo Room for lunch and pie — it's been a locals' favorite since 1953 and the atmosphere is pure small-town Alaska. The strawberry rhubarb pie sells out quickly.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What is Haines Alaska known for?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Haines is famous for the world's largest concentration of bald eagles. The Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve hosts over 3,000 eagles during the fall salmon run (October-February). The town also features Fort William H. Seward historic district, excellent hiking, authentic Tlingit culture, and genuine small-town Alaska charm without the tourist crowds.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Haines worth visiting on an Alaska cruise?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely — Haines offers the most authentic small-town Alaska experience on the Inside Passage. With only 2,500 residents and far fewer cruise ships than major ports, you'll find genuine frontier atmosphere, world-class eagle viewing, excellent hiking, and local art galleries without fighting crowds.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Can you walk from the cruise port?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes — Haines is very walkable. The cruise dock is about 0.5 miles from downtown and 0.75 miles from Fort Seward. Terrain is flat and sidewalks are paved. Most visitors walk comfortably between attractions.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">When is the best time to see eagles in Haines?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The peak eagle gathering occurs October through February when over 3,000 eagles congregate along the Chilkat River to feed on late-run salmon. Summer cruise visitors will still see dozens of eagles year-round, just not the massive fall numbers.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What should I do if I only have a few hours in Haines?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Walk to Fort Seward and downtown. Visit Alaska Indian Arts to see totem carving, browse the galleries, and have lunch at the Bamboo Room. This gives you authentic Haines atmosphere without needing transportation. If you have 4+ hours, add the eagle preserve tour.</p>
