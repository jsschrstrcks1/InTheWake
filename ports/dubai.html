        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>A note from the author:</strong> Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake — gathered from charts I trust, checked against the wisdom of those who've dropped anchor here before me. I'll update this logbook once I've walked these shores and tested these waters firsthand.</p>
      </aside>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>The first time I saw the Burj Khalifa from the ship's deck, I understood why Dubai has become the jewel of Middle Eastern cruising. Our vessel looked almost humble against the world's tallest building piercing the morning sky—828 meters of glass and steel rising 164 floors into the desert air, its needle-point crown visible from forty miles out. As we approached Mina Rashid, one of the world's largest cruise terminals with its six gleaming docks, traditional wooden dhows bobbed alongside our modern cruise ship. It struck me then: Dubai tells two stories at once—heritage trading port and modern global hub—and somehow both are equally true.</p>

        <p>The transformation still astonishes me. In the 1960s, this was a fishing village of perhaps 59,000 souls, their livelihood drawn from the Creek's pearl-diving waters. Today, over four million people call this desert metropolis home. You feel that collision of eras everywhere: in the Al Fahidi historical neighborhood, where 18th-century traditional buildings with their wind towers crouch beneath gleaming towers; in the Gold Souk across the Creek in Deira, where hundreds of jewelry shops display more gold than you've ever seen, their glittering windows reflecting a trade route centuries old. The spice souk next door fills the air with aromatic fragrances—saffron, frankincense, cardamom—and the vendors still expect you to haggle, laughing when you pay asking price like some naive sailor on first landfall.</p>

        <p>Dubai confounded every expectation I had. Yes, it's opulent—absurdly, gleefully opulent. The Palm Jumeirah stretches into the Arabian Gulf like a man-made miracle, its fronds visible from space, crowned by the coral-pink Atlantis resort. The Dubai Frame stands as the world's largest picture frame, literally framing old and new Dubai in a single vista. But beyond the superlatives, there's genuine warmth here. The call to prayer echoing between skyscrapers, the elderly Emirati man who insisted on buying us coffee after we admired his falcon, the way the city transforms at sunset when heat finally relents—these aren't contradictions to Dubai's modernity; they're essential to understanding it.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on the 148th-floor observation deck of the Burj Khalifa at sunset, watching the city transform from gold to pink to deep purple, then seeing the lights flicker on across the endless expanse below. The building opened in 2010, named for UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and from that height—2,715 feet above the desert—I understood why people build impossible things. Sometimes you need to stand above the clouds to remember how beautiful the earth is. The ticket wasn't cheap, but some views are worth whatever they cost.
        </div>

        <p>What surprised me most was discovering pockets of old Dubai still breathing between the shopping malls and skyscrapers. An abra ride across Dubai Creek cost one dirham—about twenty-five cents—and felt like time travel, the wooden boat's diesel engine chugging past waterfront souks that have traded here for generations. In Al Fahidi, I wandered narrow lanes where wind towers caught the breeze as they had for two centuries, the silence broken only by distant traffic. Even the Dubai Mall, vast as a small city, revealed unexpected grace in the fountain shows at twilight, water dancing to Arabic music beneath the Burj Khalifa's soaring shadow. This city shouldn't work—it's too new, too ambitious, too hot—and yet it does, magnificently.</p>

      <!-- Getting Around -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around Dubai</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Dubai is spread out but well-connected.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Metro</h4>
        <p>The Red Line runs from near the port (Al Ghubaiba station, 10-minute taxi) through Downtown Dubai (Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall station) to Dubai Marina. Clean, fast, air-conditioned, and cheap — under $2 per ride. Get a Nol card at any station.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Taxis</h4>
        <p>Metered, air-conditioned, and honest. Flag fall is about $3, and a ride to Burj Khalifa runs $10-15. The RTA taxi app works well. Women traveling alone can request pink-roofed female-driver taxis.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Abra (Water Taxi)</h4>
        <p>Traditional wooden boats crossing Dubai Creek — just 1 AED (about $0.27). The most atmospheric way to travel between Bur Dubai and Deira. Runs constantly; no schedule needed.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Walking</h4>
        <p>Possible within districts (Dubai Mall area, Old Dubai souks) but not between them. Summer heat makes outdoor walking dangerous — stick to air-conditioned connections.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Top Experiences -->
      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What I'd do with limited time.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Burj Khalifa</h4>
        <p>The world's tallest building (828m/2,715ft, 164 floors) opened in 2010 and remains genuinely awe-inspiring. Named after UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, it features observation decks on the 124th floor ("At the Top") and 148th floor ("At the Top SKY"). Book tickets online in advance—sunset timing costs more but is worth every dirham. Budget: $40-80 per person depending on timing and deck level.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Fountain</h4>
        <p>The world's largest choreographed fountain performs every 30 minutes from 6pm-11pm (plus 1pm and 1:30pm shows). Completely free. Watch from the Dubai Mall waterfront terrace or take an abra ride on the Burj Lake ($5) for an up-close experience.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Palm Jumeirah</h4>
        <p>This man-made archipelago stretching into the Arabian Gulf is visible from space—a testament to Dubai's ambition. The monorail runs along the trunk to the Atlantis resort at the crown, offering stunning views. Even if you're not staying there, the Atlantis aquarium and waterpark are open to visitors. Take a taxi or monorail from the mainland; budget 2-3 hours for a proper visit.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Al Fahidi Historical Neighborhood</h4>
        <p>Dubai's oldest preserved district features traditional 18th-century buildings with distinctive wind towers that naturally cooled homes before air conditioning. Wander the narrow lanes, visit the Dubai Museum in Al Fahidi Fort, and duck into art galleries and cafes in restored courtyard houses. It's a peaceful oasis that shows what Dubai was before the skyscrapers—and it's completely free to explore.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Gold Souk</h4>
        <p>In Deira, across Dubai Creek. Hundreds of shops displaying more gold than you've ever seen in one place—the glittering displays are mesmerizing even from the street. Prices are based on daily gold rates plus craftsmanship; bargaining is not just expected but part of the experience. Even if you're not buying, the spectacle and energy are worth the abra ride across the Creek.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Spice Souk</h4>
        <p>Adjacent to the Gold Souk, this aromatic market fills the air with fragrances of saffron, frankincense, dried fruits, and traditional Arabian spices. Much more affordable than gold, and the vendors genuinely love sharing their knowledge about blends and uses. Perfect for unique souvenirs that actually fit in your luggage.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Frame</h4>
        <p>The world's largest picture frame (150m tall) literally frames views of old and new Dubai—look north toward Deira and the Creek's historic districts, south toward the Burj Khalifa and modern skyline. The glass-floored bridge at the top isn't for the faint of heart, but the symbolism of standing between Dubai's past and future is powerful. Tickets around $15.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Desert Safari</h4>
        <p>Half-day excursions include dune bashing (thrilling 4x4 driving over sand dunes), camel rides, henna painting, and a BBQ dinner with belly dancing. Book through the ship or vetted operators. Budget: $60-100 per person.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Dubai Mall</h4>
        <p>One of the world's largest malls — 1,200+ stores, an aquarium, ice rink, and endless dining. Don't dismiss it as "just shopping" — it's a destination. The aquarium viewing panel (free) and underwater zoo (paid) impress even non-shoppers.</p>

        <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Things I wish I'd known.</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Ramadan:</strong> If visiting during Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking in public during daylight hours is prohibited. Restaurants have screened areas for non-Muslims.</li>
          <li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Available only in licensed venues (hotels, some restaurants). Don't drink in public or appear intoxicated.</li>
          <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Ask before photographing people, especially Emirati women. Avoid photographing government buildings and military installations.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> Service charges are often included, but small tips (10-15%) are appreciated.</li>
          <li><strong>Friday:</strong> The Islamic holy day. Some businesses close Friday morning; malls open around noon.</li>
