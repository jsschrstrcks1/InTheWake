      <h3>Surfside Grill Review: The Poolside Burger Stand</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Surfside Grill (or the Pool Grill) is NCL's complimentary outdoor grill near the main pool, found across the fleet. It serves burgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken, and fries — classic pool-day food cooked on a flat-top grill. It's open during daytime hours on sea days and operates as a walk-up counter. Included in the cruise fare.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The Cheeseburger is the default order and it's decent — a properly grilled patty with standard toppings on a soft bun. It's not gourmet, but it's hot, fresh, and satisfying when you've been in the sun all morning. The Hot Dog is better than expected — grilled with some char, proper snap. The Grilled Chicken Breast is dry more often than not — it sits on the grill too long waiting for takers. The French Fries are standard fast-food style, thin and salty. The Veggie Burger is available and passable. Where it falls short: the buns can be stale by mid-afternoon. Condiments are the basic packets — ketchup, mustard, relish. There's no creativity here: no special sauce, no grilled onions, no jalapeños. And the line on sea days at noon can stretch 15-20 people deep.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>It's walk-up counter service — the grill team cooks continuously and you grab your order. There's no customization beyond basic toppings. The speed depends on how fast the grill team is working; during peak hours, expect a 5-10 minute wait. The team is efficient but overwhelmed on busy sea days. No drinks are served at the grill itself — you need to get those separately from a nearby bar.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>You're standing in line at an outdoor grill by the pool in your swimsuit and flip-flops. That is the atmosphere. The smell of grilling burgers drifts across the pool deck, which is both the marketing and the product. There's no seating at the grill — grab your food and find a spot. On sea days, the pool deck is the social center of the ship, and the grill is the refueling station.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5.</strong> Surfside Grill delivers what every pool needs — hot burgers and fries, free, with no fuss. The cheeseburger and hot dog are reliable, and the outdoor grilling adds appeal. It loses points for the dry chicken, stale afternoon buns, and the long sea-day lines. <em>Tip:</em> Go at 11:30 a.m. when the grill first opens — fresh buns, short line, hot-off-the-grill burgers. By 1 p.m., you're in the lunch rush.</p>
