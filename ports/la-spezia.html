      <h1>La Spezia: Your Gateway to Cinque Terre's Painted Villages</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>I'll be honest – La Spezia itself isn't the draw. It's a working Italian port city, pleasant enough but not what you came for. What you came for is fifteen minutes away by train: Cinque Terre, five impossibly colorful villages clinging to cliffs above the Ligurian Sea, connected by hiking trails and a railroad that punches through mountains. It's UNESCO-listed and Instagram-famous for good reason.</p>

        <p>The logistics matter here. From the cruise terminal, you can walk to La Spezia Centrale train station in 15-20 minutes (or taxi for €10). Trains run to Cinque Terre villages every 15-30 minutes. Buy a Cinque Terre Card that includes train rides and trail access. Do this early – summer days bring thousands of visitors, and the villages are tiny.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment I'll Never Forget:</strong> Sitting on the rocks in Manarola at sunset, watching the pastel houses turn golden, eating fresh focaccia with pesto, a glass of Sciacchetrà wine in hand. Behind me, Italians were arguing about football. Kids jumped into the sea. It was everything I'd imagined Italy to be.

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>The Five Villages</h2>
        <p><strong>Riomaggiore:</strong> The southernmost village and closest to La Spezia. Colorful houses tumble down to a small harbor. The main street is genuinely charming – less polished than postcard shots suggest, which somehow makes it better.</p>
        <p><strong>Manarola:</strong> The photographer's favorite, especially at sunset when the jumbled houses glow golden above rocky swimming spots. Don't miss the Sciacchetrà wine made from grapes grown on impossible terraces.</p>
        <p><strong>Corniglia:</strong> The only village without direct sea access – it sits on a 100-meter cliff, reached by 382 steps (or shuttle). Quieter, more authentic, with the best gelato and fewer crowds.</p>
        <p><strong>Vernazza:</strong> Many call this the most beautiful, with its harbor, church, and castle ruins creating a perfect composition. Arrive early or stay late – midday is overwhelmed with tour groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Monterosso:</strong> The largest village with an actual beach. Split between old and new town, it's more resort-like but offers amenities the others lack. Beach chairs, restaurants, room to breathe.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Hiking the Trails</h2>
        <p>The Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail) once connected all five villages, but portions regularly close due to landslides. Check trail status before planning. Currently, the Monterosso-Vernazza and Vernazza-Corniglia sections are the most reliably open.</p>
        <p>The Monterosso-Vernazza hike takes about 2 hours with moderate difficulty – steep in places, with incredible views throughout. Start early before the heat, bring water, and wear proper shoes. The trail is not suitable for flip-flops or dress shoes, despite what you'll see others attempting.</p>
        <p>Alternative: Take the train between villages and explore each on foot. You'll cover more ground and spend less energy on steep paths. Save hiking for your favorite stretch.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>The Food</h2>
        <p>Liguria invented pesto – the basil here has a different flavor than anywhere else, and the traditional version uses Pecorino and Parmesan, pine nuts, garlic, and local olive oil. Eat it on trofie pasta or slathered on focaccia. Don't accept imitations.</p>
        <p>Focaccia di Recco is a thin, cheese-filled flatbread that's crispy, gooey, and addictive. Farinata (chickpea flatbread) is the local street food. Fresh anchovies, fried or marinated, appear everywhere and are nothing like the canned version you know.</p>
        <p>The local wines – Sciacchetrà (sweet) and Vermentino (dry white) – pair perfectly with the seafood. They're not famous outside Liguria, which means they're relatively affordable and authentically local.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Can I see all five villages in one port day?</summary><p>Technically possible but not recommended. You'll spend the day on trains and rushing through villages. Pick 2-3 and actually experience them. Manarola + Vernazza is a popular combination.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Should I book a ship excursion or go independently?</summary><p>Independent is cheaper and more flexible – trains are easy, and you set your own pace. Ship excursions guarantee you won't miss the ship but often rush through villages with large groups.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is La Spezia worth exploring?</summary><p>If you have time after Cinque Terre, the old town has a pleasant market, good restaurants, and the Naval Museum. Most cruisers head straight to the villages, though.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's the best time to visit Cinque Terre?</summary><p>Early morning or late afternoon avoids the worst crowds. Midday in summer is brutal – packed trains, lines everywhere, overwhelmed villages. Start at first light if possible.</p></details>

        <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
        <p><strong>La Spezia</strong> is your gateway to UNESCO Cinque Terre – five colorful villages stacked on Mediterranean cliffs. Take the train (15 min), pick 2-3 villages, eat pesto and focaccia, watch sunset from Manarola's rocks. This is bucket-list Italy – just go early to beat the crowds.</p>
