      "markdown": "**TSS Mardi Gras launched Carnival Cruise Line in 1972—the ship that started what would become the world's largest cruise company.**\n\nTed Arison founded Carnival with this converted Canadian Pacific ocean liner, originally named Empress of Canada. The ship's transformation into Mardi Gras marked the beginning of the 'Fun Ships' revolution.\n\nThe inaugural voyage on March 11, 1972, was inauspicious—the ship ran aground leaving Miami. But Carnival recovered, refined its approach, and built success from this unlikely beginning.\n\nMardi Gras introduced the casual, party-focused cruising that would define Carnival. The ship served Caribbean routes from Miami, targeting first-time cruisers seeking fun rather than formality.\n\nFor company origin: Mardi Gras was where Carnival began. Every ship in the current fleet traces its heritage to this converted ocean liner and the vision she represented.",

      "markdown": "**TSS Mardi Gras's inaugural voyage included grounding on a sandbar—a troubled start that nearly ended Carnival's story before it began.**\n\nThe grounding made headlines and damaged credibility. Early months brought financial struggles as the new company found its footing. Carnival's survival was uncertain.\n\nBut Ted Arison and his team persevered. They refined the Fun Ships concept, adjusted pricing, improved marketing, and built the party atmosphere that would attract passengers.\n\nMardi Gras gradually found success. The ship's Caribbean cruises attracted travelers who had never cruised before. The accessible pricing and casual atmosphere proved appealing.\n\nFor survival story: Mardi Gras's troubled start makes Carnival's eventual dominance more remarkable. The company that nearly failed with one grounded ship now operates the world's largest cruise fleet.",

      "markdown": "**TSS Mardi Gras pioneered the Fun Ships approach that would transform cruising from elite pastime to mass-market vacation option.**\n\nTraditional cruise lines emphasized formality, tradition, and exclusivity. Carnival's Mardi Gras offered something different: casual atmosphere, affordable pricing, and entertainment-focused experience.\n\nThe ship featured nightclub-style entertainment, casual dining, and party atmosphere that attracted younger, less wealthy passengers than traditional lines served.\n\nThe approach worked. Passengers who had never considered cruising discovered ocean vacations through Mardi Gras. The market expanded dramatically as Carnival proved cruising could be fun and accessible.\n\nFor industry impact: Mardi Gras started a revolution. The ship proved that cruising could serve everyone—not just the wealthy and formal. That insight built the modern cruise industry.",
