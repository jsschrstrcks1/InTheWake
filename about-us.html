            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Ahoy, voyagers! Welcome to <strong>Cruising in the Wake</strong>, your trusty compass for sailing through cruise planning with joy and ease. We’re here to chart your course with mariner wisdom—ship overviews, port tips, restaurant menus, solo travel hacks—all crafted to keep your adventure sailing through calm seas, no squalls in sight. Whether you’re a rookie cruiser or a seasoned skipper, we’ve got the map to make your journey a breeze.</p>
            <p>I’m your captain, driven by a love for adventure, beauty, and connection. First, <strong>Cruising in the Wake</strong> is my flagship project, a logbook sharing real-voyage know-how to ensure your trip feels like smooth sailing. Next, through <a href="http://www.flickersofmajesty.com">Flickers of Majesty</a>, I capture the sea’s fleeting wonders—think glowing sunsets or vibrant port markets—in photos that spark your wanderlust. On land, I tend a quirky flock of sheep, guiding them with the same care I bring to steering cruisers toward unforgettable destinations. Finally, as a pastor at <a href="https://lakeviewfellowshipchurch.com">Lakeview Fellowship Church</a>, I live by <em>“Taking Strangers Making Family,”</em> fostering community with grace, a Bachelor of Arts, and a Master of Divinity in the works.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to turn cruise planning into a delight, not a storm. We dive into the details—accessibility, packing lists, drink packages—so you can savor the memories. Like a perfect snapshot or a warm fellowship, we’re here to make strangers into shipmates, united by the majesty of the sea.</p>
            <p class="center"><strong>Set sail with us!</strong> Explore our guides, pack your sea bag, and let’s make waves together. Fair winds and following wakes—your adventure’s on the horizon!</p>
