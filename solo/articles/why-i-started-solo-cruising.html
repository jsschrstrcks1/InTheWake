  <h1>Why I Started Solo Cruising (and Built a Community)</h1>
  <p class="dek">From that first solo gangway to a thriving community — lessons, safety, and the unexpected joy of sailing on your own terms.</p>

  <p>I booked my first solo cruise because I was done waiting for everyone else’s calendar. I stayed for the freedom — coffee at sunrise, new friends by lunch, and a quiet deck chair when I needed to breathe. Solo doesn’t mean alone; it means you finally get to choose.</p>

  <p class="pill disclosure"><strong>Author’s note:</strong> These are lessons from real sailings and real meetups — what worked, what didn’t, and what I tell every first-timer who messages the group.</p>

  <h2>Why I Went Solo</h2>
  <p>My first sailing was a reset. No coordinating, no compromises, just an open horizon and a safe home base to explore from. I found a rhythm: mornings on deck with coffee, afternoons ashore with a small group, evenings choosing a show or turning in early. The best surprise? The community — people who get it and cheer you on.</p>

  <h2>What I Wish I’d Known</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hit the solo meetup on day one.</strong> Cliques form early; show up and say hi.</li>
    <li><strong>Ship excursions are worth it in some ports.</strong> The ship will wait for official tours — peace of mind is priceless.</li>
    <li><strong>Pack light but smart.</strong> Hooks, a compact charger, and layers matter. See the checklist I use in <a href="https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/packing.html?utm_source=solo_article&utm_medium=body_link&utm_campaign=tina_profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packing Lists</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety, Belonging, and Joy</h2>
  <p>Solo is a balance: independence and connection. I love quiet balcony mornings and choosing a two-top for dinner if I’m peopled-out — and I also love trivia teams, meetups, and ad-hoc shore buddies. Give yourself permission to do both.</p>
