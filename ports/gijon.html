    <article class="card"><h1>Gijón: My Green Coast Awakening</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>I stepped off the shuttle into a Spain I didn't expect — green hills instead of sunbaked plains, Atlantic mist instead of Mediterranean glare, bagpipes echoing through ancient stone streets. Gijón sits at the heart of Asturias, the Celtic fringe of Spain they call España Verde, where the Bay of Biscay crashes against a coastline that feels more Scottish than Spanish.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/gijon/gijon-2.webp" alt="Gijón harbor view" loading="lazy">

        <p>We walked straight to Cimadevilla, the old fisherman's quarter perched on a peninsula jutting into the sea. Narrow cobblestone lanes climbed toward the Cerro de Santa Catalina headland, where Eduardo Chillida's massive concrete sculpture — Elogio del Horizonte — frames the horizon like cupped hands offering the ocean to the sky. I stood inside its curved embrace while the Atlantic wind roared through the opening, creating a sound somewhere between a whisper and a hymn. The sculpture faces north, toward nothing but water and weather, and somehow that emptiness felt full of meaning.</p>

        <p>Down at San Lorenzo Beach, the city's golden urban shore stretches for nearly a mile and a half in a perfect arc. Locals were surfing in wetsuits, families building sandcastles, elderly couples walking the promenade. The beach sits right in the city center — you can see apartment buildings on one side and open ocean on the other. The water was cold, bracing, alive. This isn't a manicured Mediterranean resort; it's a working port city where real people live real lives next to the sea.</p>

      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

        <p>Later we stumbled into the Termas Romanas — ancient Roman baths from the 1st century AD, excavated right in the middle of downtown. Walking through the hypocaust system where hot air once warmed the floors, touching stones that Romans touched two thousand years ago, I felt that familiar shiver of deep time. Gijón has been a port for millennia, a place where people have always looked out at the horizon and wondered what lies beyond.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing inside Chillida's Elogio del Horizonte at sunset, watching the Atlantic turn copper and purple while the curved concrete amplified the sound of wind and waves into something that felt like the ocean breathing. I understood why pilgrims have walked this coast for centuries — there's something holy about the edge of the world.

        <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
        <p><strong>Port Location:</strong> Ships dock at El Musel, Gijón's industrial port about 6 kilometers north of the city center. The port provides free shuttle buses to Plaza Mayor in the heart of town, a journey of approximately 15 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (EUR). ATMs are widely available throughout the city center. Credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops, though smaller establishments and market vendors may prefer cash.</p>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Spanish (Castellano) and Asturian (Asturianu) are both spoken. English is less common than in major tourist cities, but you'll find English speakers in tourist areas and younger generations. Learning a few Spanish phrases enhances your experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> May through September offers the warmest weather, though "warm" in Asturias means comfortable rather than hot. This green coast gets its verdant landscape from frequent rain — pack a light jacket even in summer. October and April can be lovely with fewer crowds.</p>
        <p><strong>What Makes Gijón Special:</strong> Unlike heavily touristed Spanish ports, Gijón remains refreshingly authentic. You'll encounter genuine local culture, Celtic-influenced traditions, and a slower pace that invites wandering rather than rushing. The city combines Roman ruins, industrial heritage, and contemporary art against a backdrop of beaches and green hills.</p>

        <h3>Top Experiences</h3>

        <h4>Elogio del Horizonte (In Praise of the Horizon)</h4>
        <p>Eduardo Chillida's 1990 masterpiece crowns the Cerro de Santa Catalina headland. The massive sculpture — ten tons of weathering steel formed into curved, embracing arms — creates an acoustic chamber where ocean winds produce haunting tones. Walk inside, face the horizon, and listen. The sculpture has become Gijón's symbol, and rightly so. It captures something essential about this coast: the meeting of land and sea, the pull of the unknown, the way emptiness can feel sacred. Free to visit, incredible at any time, but magical at sunset.</p>

        <h4>Cimadevilla — The Fisherman's Quarter</h4>
        <p>This ancient neighborhood occupies the rocky peninsula where Gijón began. Narrow streets climb past colorful houses, hidden plazas, and centuries-old churches. The Palacio de Revillagigedo, an 18th-century baroque palace, now houses contemporary art exhibitions. Locals still live here, hanging laundry from balconies, chatting in doorways. Walk slowly, get lost deliberately, and stop at neighborhood bars where fishermen drink morning coffee. This is the soul of old Gijón.</p>

        <h4>Termas Romanas del Campo Valdés (Roman Baths)</h4>
        <p>First-century Roman baths sit beneath modern Gijón, excavated and preserved as a remarkable museum. The underground complex reveals the sophisticated engineering of Roman bathing culture — frigidarium (cold room), tepidarium (warm room), caldarium (hot room), and the intricate hypocaust heating system. Touch the ancient stones, walk through spaces that hosted Roman bathers, and marvel that this coastal outpost was part of an empire stretching from Britain to North Africa. Entry is inexpensive; the connection to deep history is priceless.</p>

        <h4>San Lorenzo Beach & Promenade</h4>
        <p>This urban beach defines Gijón's character. The golden sand curves for 1,500 meters along the city center, backed by a wide promenade perfect for strolling. Locals surf here year-round. Families picnic on the sand. The beach offers a Blue Flag for cleanliness, though the water stays brisk even in summer. Walk the length of the promenade from the eastern headland to the western harbor, watching the city live its daily life beside the sea. This is Gijón at its most relaxed and authentic.</p>

        <h4>Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura</h4>
        <p>This enormous cultural complex occupies what was once the largest orphanage in Spain, built in the 1950s as a monument to Franco-era ambition. Today the massive structure houses contemporary art exhibitions, theaters, and interactive science displays. The central tower — visible from across the city — offers panoramic views. The building itself fascinates: brutalist architecture on a staggering scale, now repurposed for culture and creativity. Worth visiting for the architecture alone, even better if an exhibition catches your interest.</p>

        <h4>Aquarium of Gijón</h4>
        <p>This excellent aquarium focuses on Cantabrian Sea marine life — the Atlantic ecosystem right outside. Walk through underwater tunnels while sharks, rays, and schools of fish swim overhead. Touch pools let you interact with sea creatures carefully. The facility emphasizes conservation and education, making it engaging for all ages. Located on the beach promenade, it makes a perfect rainy-day activity or a complement to beach time.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Getting Around</h3>
        <p><strong>From the Ship:</strong> Free shuttle buses run from El Musel port to Plaza Mayor in the city center. The journey takes about 15 minutes. Shuttles typically run continuously during port hours, though check with your cruise line for specific schedules.</p>
        <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Once in the city center, Gijón is highly walkable. San Lorenzo Beach, Cimadevilla, the Roman baths, and central shopping areas are all within easy walking distance of each other. The city is relatively flat along the coast, though the old quarter has some hills.</p>
        <p><strong>Buses:</strong> Gijón's city bus system (EMTUSA) is efficient and inexpensive. Single tickets cost around €1.30, available from the driver. Buses connect the center to Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura and other outlying areas. The tourist office at Plaza Mayor provides route maps.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Taxis are affordable and readily available at taxi ranks near Plaza Mayor and along major streets. Fares are metered. Expect to pay €8-12 for most in-city journeys. Taxis accept credit cards, though having some cash is wise.</p>
        <p><strong>Bike Rentals:</strong> The flat beachfront promenade is ideal for cycling. Several rental shops offer bikes by the hour or day. The dedicated bike path along San Lorenzo Beach provides safe, scenic riding.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
        <p><strong>Sidra (Asturian Cider):</strong> The drink of Asturias. Unlike fizzy commercial ciders, sidra natural is flat and tart, made from regional apples. The ritual matters: servers pour from height (escanciar) in a thin stream into a wide glass held low, aerating the cider. You receive a small amount — a culín — which you drink quickly before it loses its brief fizz. The process repeats. Visit a traditional sidrería (cider house) like Casa Trabanco or Tierra Astur for the full experience. Sawdust often covers floors to absorb spilled cider. The atmosphere is loud, convivial, and uniquely Asturian.</p>
        <p><strong>Fabada Asturiana:</strong> The region's signature dish — a rich white bean stew with chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage), and pork. Hearty, warming, and deeply satisfying. Perfect for the cool, rainy climate. Every restaurant serves their version; locals have strong opinions about whose is best.</p>
        <p><strong>Cachopo:</strong> Two large veal escalopes stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded, fried, and served with fries. Enormous. Decadent. Delicious. Often large enough to share. Don't attempt this after a big breakfast.</p>
        <p><strong>Seafood:</strong> As a coastal city, Gijón excels with fresh catch. Grilled pulpo (octopus), navajas (razor clams), and percebes (goose barnacles) appear on menus throughout the port area. The municipal market — Mercado de El Molinón — offers pristine seafood displays worth seeing even if you're not buying.</p>
        <p><strong>Cabrales Cheese:</strong> Asturias produces Spain's most famous blue cheese. Aged in limestone caves, Cabrales ranges from mild to explosively pungent. Try it drizzled with honey as dessert, or in a sauce over steak. Strong stuff — a little goes far.</p>
        <p><strong>Where to Eat:</strong> The streets around Cimadevilla and Plaza Mayor offer countless options. For traditional sidrerías, head to Casa Trabanco or Tierra Astur. For seafood, try restaurants along the marina. For pintxos (Asturian-style tapas), wander Calle Corrida and duck into any bar that looks busy with locals.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Embrace the Weather:</strong> Asturias earned its green landscape through regular rain. Pack a light waterproof jacket even on sunny mornings. Locals say "Asturias has four seasons in one day" — and they're not exaggerating. The changeable weather adds to the Celtic atmosphere.</p>
        <p><strong>Skip the Mediterranean Expectations:</strong> Gijón isn't Spain's sun-and-sangria south. The cultural influences here are Celtic, the climate is Atlantic, and the vibe is more Ireland than Ibiza. Adjust your expectations and embrace what makes this coast unique.</p>
        <p><strong>Try the Cider Ritual:</strong> Even if you're not normally a cider drinker, experiencing escanciar in a traditional sidrería is essential to understanding Asturian culture. The ritual, the communal atmosphere, and the local pride in their regional drink create an experience you won't find elsewhere in Spain.</p>
        <p><strong>Visit Chillida's Sculpture at Different Times:</strong> The Elogio del Horizonte changes dramatically with weather and light. Morning mist creates mystery, afternoon sun reveals texture, sunset brings drama. If you have time, visit twice — the sculpture rewards repeated viewing.</p>
        <p><strong>Learn Basic Spanish:</strong> English is less common here than in Barcelona or Madrid. Download a translation app and learn phrases like "Gracias" (thank you), "Por favor" (please), and "La cuenta, por favor" (the check, please). Locals appreciate the effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Check Laboral Hours:</strong> The Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura keeps variable hours and may close for exhibitions changes. Check their website or call ahead if this is a priority. The exterior and grounds are impressive even if the interior is closed.</p>
        <p><strong>Combine Beach and Culture:</strong> Gijón's compact size lets you mix beach time with cultural sights. Spend the morning at Roman baths and Cimadevilla, enjoy lunch at a sidrería, then relax on San Lorenzo Beach for the afternoon. This balance captures the city's dual character.</p>

          <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Gijón worth visiting on a cruise?</summary>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely. Gijón offers authentic Asturian culture without overwhelming cruise crowds. The blend of Celtic heritage, Roman history, and genuine Spanish coastal life makes it one of northern Spain's most rewarding ports. You'll experience a side of Spain that feels worlds away from the Mediterranean cruise circuit.</p>

        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
          <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What is Elogio del Horizonte?</summary>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Elogio del Horizonte (In Praise of the Horizon) is Eduardo Chillida's iconic concrete sculpture on the Cerro de Santa Catalina headland. The massive curved form frames the Atlantic horizon and creates haunting acoustic effects when wind passes through. It's become Gijón's symbol and is absolutely worth the walk up the headland.</p>

          <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How do you pour Asturian cider?</summary>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Asturian cider is poured from height in a technique called escanciar. The server holds the bottle overhead and pours in a thin stream into a wide glass held low, aerating the cider and creating a brief fizz. You receive a small pour (culín) which you drink quickly, then the process repeats. It's part ritual, part theater, all Asturian tradition.</p>

          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Ships dock at El Musel port, about 6 kilometers from the city center. Walking isn't practical, but free shuttle buses run to Plaza Mayor in the heart of town. From the shuttle drop-off, everything in central Gijón is walkable — San Lorenzo Beach, Cimadevilla, Roman baths, and restaurants are all within easy reach.</p>

          <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What's the weather like?</summary>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Gijón sits on Spain's "Green Coast" — mild, maritime climate with regular rain that keeps everything lush. Summers are comfortable (rarely hot), winters are mild. Rain can arrive any season, often brief showers rather than all-day downpours. Pack layers and a light rain jacket. The changeable weather is part of the Celtic character of this coast.</p>

          <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How long do I need in Gijón?</summary>
          <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">A typical port day (6-8 hours) is enough to see the highlights: Elogio del Horizonte and Cimadevilla in the morning, lunch at a sidrería, Roman baths, and beach time in the afternoon. The city's walkable size works well for cruise visitors. If you have more time, add Laboral Ciudad de la Cultura or simply slow down and soak in the atmosphere — Gijón rewards unhurried exploration.</p>
