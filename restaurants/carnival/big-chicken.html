      <h3>Big Chicken Review: Shaq-Sized Sandwiches That Deliver</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Shaquille O'Neal's Big Chicken brings the NBA legend's fried chicken concept to sea — and it works better than a celebrity partnership has any right to. This is a complimentary counter-service spot, usually near the pool deck, serving hefty chicken sandwiches and tenders. There's no cover charge, no reservation needed — just walk up and eat. On a ship where the Lido Marketplace can feel like a cafeteria, Big Chicken is a welcome alternative with actual personality.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The signature fried chicken sandwich is the move — a thick, crispy-breaded breast on a brioche bun with pickles and "Shaq Sauce" (a slightly sweet, slightly spicy mayo). It's genuinely good fast-food fried chicken, and the portion is generous. The spicy version adds a sriracha kick that works. The chicken tenders are solid for kids and adults who prefer fingers over sandwiches. Fries are standard — nothing special, but they do the job. Where Big Chicken loses a half-step: the menu is narrow (it's chicken sandwiches and tenders — that's it), and by Day 5 of a week-long cruise, you may have had your fill. The Mac &amp; Cheese side, when available, is a reliable comfort add-on.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Counter service is fast and efficient — order at the window, grab your food, find a seat. During peak pool hours (11:30 AM – 1:30 PM), lines can stretch 15–20 minutes. The food is made to order, not sitting under heat lamps, which explains the wait and the quality. Staff are friendly in a fast-food way — quick, transactional, and moving the line.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>This is pool-deck casual — plastic baskets, open-air seating, kids running around in swimsuits. The Shaq branding is fun without being obnoxious. It feels like a good boardwalk chicken shop, which is exactly the right vibe. Don't expect ambiance — expect a satisfying sandwich in the sun.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.1/5.</strong> Big Chicken is one of Carnival's best complimentary dining additions — the fried chicken sandwich is legitimately tasty, the portions are generous, and the price is right (free). It doesn't rate higher because the menu is limited and the lines can test your patience on sea days. But for a quick, satisfying pool-deck lunch, Big Chicken delivers. <em>Tip:</em> go at 11 AM when it opens or after 2 PM — the noon rush is real.</p>
