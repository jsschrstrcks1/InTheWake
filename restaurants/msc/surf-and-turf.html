      <h3>Surf &amp; Turf Review: MSC's Premium Steak and Seafood Experience</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Surf &amp; Turf is MSC's premium steakhouse and seafood restaurant, found aboard Meraviglia, Grandiosa, Virtuosa, and newer vessels. The cover charge runs $40-$50 per person, making it one of the most expensive specialty dining options in the fleet. The concept is straightforward: high-quality steaks, lobster, and seafood in a refined setting. For guests who want the most upscale dinner available on MSC, this is the destination.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The ribeye is the dish to order — a generous cut with proper marbling, aged flavor, and a char that suggests the kitchen takes its grill work seriously. It arrives with a choice of sauces (Béarnaise, peppercorn, chimichurri), all of which are well-made. The filet mignon is tender and correctly cooked to temperature — specify your preference clearly and the kitchen respects it. The lobster tail is sweet and buttery, served with drawn butter and lemon. The surf and turf combination (filet with half lobster) is the signature for good reason — it's a generous plate that justifies the premium price. Starters include a proper shrimp cocktail with jumbo prawns and a Caesar salad prepared tableside on some ships. Sides — creamed spinach, baked potato, truffle fries — are included and substantial. Where it falls short: the non-steak, non-lobster options (chicken, fish of the day) feel like afterthoughts added for companions. The dessert menu is limited and can't match the savory courses — the chocolate lava cake is acceptable, the cheesecake unremarkable. The wine list leans heavily toward bold reds (Malbec, Cabernet) at premium pricing ($14-$22 per glass) that adds significantly to the overall bill.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Service is Surf &amp; Turf's strongest supporting element. Waitstaff are polished, knowledgeable, and clearly selected for the ship's most premium venue. Steak temperatures are explained, wine pairings are suggested with genuine knowledge, and pacing allows a proper two-hour dinner without feeling rushed or neglected. The sommelier is worth engaging — they can guide you beyond the obvious selections and find wines that complement your specific order.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Dark wood, leather seating, mood lighting, and a design sensibility that channels a high-end land-based steakhouse — Surf &amp; Turf is the most refined dining room on any MSC ship. The room is intentionally intimate, seating fewer guests than other specialty venues, which keeps noise manageable and creates a sense of exclusivity. On newer ships (Virtuosa, World Europa), the design is sleeker and more contemporary; on Meraviglia, it has a classic steakhouse warmth.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.1/5.</strong> Surf &amp; Turf is MSC's best restaurant — the steaks are properly sourced and expertly grilled, the lobster is fresh and well-prepared, and the service matches the premium positioning. It falls just short of a higher rating because the non-steak options underwhelm, desserts don't match the savory courses, and the wine pricing turns an already-expensive dinner into a significant splurge. <em>Tip:</em> order the ribeye over the filet for more flavor, pair it with the chimichurri, and ask the sommelier for a mid-range Malbec rather than defaulting to the house red — the pairing elevates the entire meal.</p>
