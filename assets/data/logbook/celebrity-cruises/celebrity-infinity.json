      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nAthena's waiter in the Trellis Restaurant was from Thessaloniki. When she ordered in Greek — halting, her parents' dialect, not textbook — he answered in Greek and didn't correct her. He brought her horiatiki when it wasn't on the menu, and charged it as a side salad. At Café al Bacio, the barista learned her Ellinikos coffee preference and started preparing it when she appeared in the doorway. These were not favors. They were recognitions.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nAthena's parents left Kalymnos in 1962. She grew up in Astoria, Queens, eating her mother's food and speaking a language she was told not to use at school. She retired from teaching in June and booked the 10-night Greek Islands sailing from Piraeus in September. Her first time in Greece. She chose Infinity because the itinerary included Crete, Rhodes, and Santorini — and because the fare was manageable on a teacher's pension. Embarkation at Piraeus smelled like diesel and seawater and something she couldn't name. Her mother would have called it home.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe onyx staircase in the Grand Foyer stopped her the first time she saw it. Backlit, translucent, glowing amber in a ship of dated corridors and 2001-era carpet. She thought about the marble in the churches on Kalymnos that her mother had described — light passing through stone. The staircase felt like that.\n\nHer inside cabin was small and dark. The bathroom fixtures were original. The mattress sagged slightly left. She didn't care. She was not here for the room. She was here for Rhodes at dawn and Santorini at sunset and the water between them.\n\nTrellis served competent food for a week, then the rotation became obvious. The Oceanview Café was better for breakfast — eggs, yogurt, strong coffee, a view of whatever island was approaching. Sushi on Five surprised her: precise, serious, and the only meal aboard that felt like someone was paying attention to each plate.\n\nThe ship is aging. The pool deck rails showed rust. The entertainment was thin — lounge singers, a magician, a comedian she left after ten minutes. But the ship was small enough to learn in a day, quiet enough to think in, and pointed at Greece. That was sufficient.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nAthena has mild arthritis in both hands — not disabling, but she avoids heavy doors and tight grips. The automatic doors on most decks helped. At the tender port in Santorini, the crew offered a steadying grip that was firm without squeezing. She noticed a man with a white cane boarding the tender in Mykonos; the crew member narrated each step aloud — \"one step down, gap of eighteen inches, step onto the platform\" — with the precision of someone trained, not guessing.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nAt the gangway in Rhodes, Athena spoke with a crew member named Zara, from Amman, Jordan. Zara managed the disembarkation queue and spoke four languages rotating between passengers. Athena asked how she ended up at sea. Zara said she'd studied tourism management in Amman but the hotels wanted her behind a desk. \"On the ship, I'm at the door,\" she said. \"I'm the first face and the last. I prefer that.\" She sent money home to her younger sister's university fees. When Athena said she'd been a teacher, Zara said, \"Then you understand — you invest in someone and hope they carry it.\" Athena did understand.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nIn Crete, Athena ate lamb at a taverna by the harbor and thought about her mother's kitchen. The lamb was similar but not the same. Nothing would be the same. But the water was the same water, and the light was the same light, and the ship had carried her here gently enough that she arrived without the exhaustion of a transatlantic flight and a rental car. She called her sister in Queens from the ship's Wi-Fi and said, \"Mama would have liked this.\" Her sister said, \"Mama would have complained about the cabin.\" They both laughed. That was the homecoming.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nThe Canyon Ranch SpaClub staff knew Noor's name by day two. Not because she told them — because they read the medical note she'd filed at booking. Her morning pool appointment was held without her needing to arrive on time. The attendant adjusted the water temperature by two degrees on day three without being asked; he'd noticed her staying in longer when it was slightly cooler. In Trellis, their waiter learned that Noor's grip was unreliable and brought her drinks in a wider glass. Simon noticed. Noor didn't mention it.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nNoor was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS at 34. She's 43 now. Her neurologist mentioned thalassotherapy — heated seawater immersion — as a complement to her medication. Simon searched which cruise ships had thalassotherapy pools and found Infinity was one of the few. They booked the 10-night Greek Islands sailing from Athens in early October. Shoulder season, manageable heat, smaller crowds. Embarkation at Piraeus was standard but long; Noor requested priority boarding and it was granted without delay.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe Thalassotherapy Pool is not a selling point in the brochure. It's listed, but it doesn't photograph well — a modest pool in the spa area, no infinity edge, no swim-up bar. What it offers is heated seawater with mineral content. Noor entered it on the first morning and stayed forty-five minutes. Her legs, which had been stiff and unpredictable for weeks, softened. Not cured. Softened. The distinction matters.\n\nShe went every morning for ten days. Simon read in the Persian Garden thermal suite while she soaked. Their routine became: pool, breakfast, port or rest, dinner. The ship organized itself around her needs without her organizing it.\n\nThe cabin was dated — white walls, old fixtures, a bathroom that required Noor to grip the doorframe turning in. The shower door leaked. Simon mopped the floor each morning. The balcony was the room's saving grace: two chairs, the Aegean, and mornings where Noor felt well enough to sit outside with coffee.\n\nTrellis served reliably. The rotation was visible by night seven but they didn't mind — they'd found three dishes they liked and ordered them repeatedly. Sushi on Five was their one splurge: clean, precise, and the chef's focus reminded Simon of Noor's neurologist — concentrated attention as a form of care.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nMS is an invisible disability on good days and a visible one on bad days. Noor used a cane on two of the ten days and nothing on the others. The elevators were reliable. The corridors were wide. The gangway in Kusadasi was steep and a crew member offered his arm; Noor took it on the way down and declined it on the way up. In Santorini, the tender transfer was manageable — she sat in the tender rather than standing, and the crew didn't rush. Rhodes was dockside and flat. Mykonos was tender-dependent and the sea was choppy; they stayed aboard. Noor said the Thalassotherapy Pool on a sea day was better than any port.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nThe spa attendant who managed the Thalassotherapy Pool most mornings was a woman named Ingrid, from Gothenburg, Sweden. She'd trained as a physiotherapist before joining Celebrity. She told Noor that she'd requested the spa assignment because she believed the water helped people in ways the ship's entertainment didn't. \"I had a guest last year with fibromyalgia,\" she said. \"She came every day for twelve days. On the last day she cried. Not because she was healed, but because she remembered what her body felt like before the pain started.\" Noor said she understood. Ingrid said, \"I know. I can tell by how you enter the water — carefully, like it owes you something.\"\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nOn the last morning, Noor stood on the balcony and watched Piraeus approach. She told Simon the pool hadn't fixed anything. Her MS was still there. Her legs would stiffen again in a week. But for ten days her body had been held by water that was warmer and saltier than a bathtub, and her muscles had remembered a version of themselves that she'd started to forget. Simon booked a return sailing before they reached the gangway. Not because it was a cure. Because it was a reprieve.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nAlistair ate alone in Trellis every night — not assigned seating, which he'd requested against. The maître d' gave him a two-top near the window without argument. His waiter, a man from Mumbai who had been with Celebrity for seven years, brought the bread basket and left. No small talk. No \"celebrating anything special tonight?\" The restraint was professional and Alistair was grateful. At the Martini Bar, the bartender learned his Negroni by night two and had it poured when Alistair rounded the corner from the elevator.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nAlistair is a commercial photographer transitioning to fine art. He booked the 11-night Canary Islands and Morocco sailing from Barcelona in November. Off-season, cheap, and the Canaries offered something the Mediterranean doesn't: volcanic terrain under Atlantic light. Lanzarote's black basalt, Tenerife's Teide at dawn, Gran Canaria's dunes. He brought two camera bodies and six lenses. Embarkation in Barcelona was efficient. He skipped the safety drill viewing the Sagrada Familia from the pool deck.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe ship interested him photographically more than he'd expected. The onyx staircase in the Grand Foyer — backlit, amber, glowing against the dated surroundings — was the best single subject aboard. He shot it at 6 AM when the atrium was empty and the cleaning crew was finishing. The contrast between the staircase and the worn carpet around it was the kind of composition he'd spend an hour setting up in a studio.\n\nHis inside cabin was functional. He used the desk as a gear station and the bed as a sorting surface. The bathroom leaked at the shower base; he put a towel down and forgot about it.\n\nFood was fuel. Trellis was adequate, the Oceanview Café was faster, and the room service sandwich at midnight after processing photos was the meal he valued most. The Cellar Masters wine bar was the one venue he returned to for pleasure — the Enomatic system let him taste Canary Island wines without committing to a bottle, and the quiet was conducive to reviewing the day's work on his laptop.\n\nThe ship is not a destination. It's a platform that positions you near destinations. For a photographer, that's exactly what a ship should be.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nAlistair has no disability, but he carries heavy equipment and noticed the ship through that lens. The elevators accommodated his pelican case without complaint. The gangway in Tangier was steep and narrow; he watched a woman with a walking frame navigate it with two crew members flanking her, and he waited until she was aboard before descending. In Lanzarote, the port was flat and the walk to the taxi stand short. The tender port at Tenerife was managed smoothly — gear and all.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nAt the Cellar Masters bar one evening, Alistair met the evening bartender, a woman named Olga from Plovdiv, Bulgaria. She'd studied oenology in Sofia before the wine industry contracted and she moved to cruise ships. She told him the Canary Island wines — Malvasía, Listán Negro — were underrated because they didn't travel well by bottle but drank perfectly fresh. \"They are honest wines,\" she said. \"They don't pretend to be Bordeaux.\" Alistair said the same was true of the ship. Olga laughed. \"The ship is like a Listán Negro,\" she said. \"Not glamorous. But if you pay attention, it surprises you.\" He photographed her hands pouring a glass. She let him.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nIn Lanzarote, standing on the volcanic rock at Timanfaya, Alistair realized the Canary Islands were the inverse of the Greek Islands — not white stone and blue water but black stone and grey Atlantic. The light was harder, less forgiving, and better for his kind of work. The ship had carried him here without interfering. That's all a photographer asks of transportation.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nThe four of them — June, Peggy, Val, and Dot — hadn't been in the same room since Peggy's sixtieth birthday in Phoenix. Trellis gave them a round table for four near the center of the room. Their waiter handled four different dietary situations without a clipboard: Val's shellfish allergy, Dot's lactose sensitivity, Peggy's preference for small portions, and June's habit of ordering two appetizers instead of a main. By night three he'd stopped asking and simply brought what they wanted. At Café al Bacio, the barista made four different coffees every morning and delivered them to the same corner table without being told they'd arrived.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nJune proposed the trip by email in January: \"Infinity was built in 2001. We graduated in 2001. Let's go.\" Peggy said yes immediately. Val needed convincing — she hadn't flown since her knee replacement. Dot said she'd go anywhere that wasn't another cruise in the Caribbean. They booked the 10-night Greek Islands sailing from Athens in September. Four inside cabins on the same corridor. Embarkation at Piraeus was slow, hot, and exactly like the airport queue they'd endured together on their backpacking trip in 1998. They survived it then. They survived it now.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe ship is twenty-three years old. So are they, relative to graduation. June found the comparison useful: the corridors show wear, the fixtures are original, and the bones are good. The pool deck was manageable for four women who'd rather read than swim. The Sky Observation Lounge became their afternoon headquarters — four armchairs, four books, four glasses of wine, and the Aegean.\n\nPeggy's cabin had a mattress dip. Val's shower leaked. Dot's air conditioning was loud. June's was fine. They compared complaints at dinner like a competitive sport. Nobody actually minded. The cabins were places to sleep, and they were together for the first time in five years.\n\nTrellis served well for the first week. After night seven, they'd identified the three best dishes and the four worst and ordered accordingly. Sushi on Five was Val's choice and the group's best meal. The Oceanview Café buffet at breakfast was where the real conversations happened — slower, less formal, coffee refills unlimited.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nVal's knee replacement limits stairs and long walks. Peggy has moderate hearing loss. Between them, they tested the ship's accessibility thoroughly. Elevators were reliable and distributed well — Val never waited more than two minutes. The tender port at Santorini was the challenge: Val managed the transfer with crew assistance but said she wouldn't do it again in rough seas. Rhodes was dockside and flat — the best port for mobility. Peggy found Trellis's acoustics acceptable but the show lounge unbearable — the speaker system was muddy and there was no hearing loop.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nOn a sea day, Dot struck up a conversation with a woman cleaning the Sky Observation Lounge windows at 7 AM. Her name was Wati, from Central Java. She'd been at sea for six years and had three children living with her mother in Semarang. She cleaned the observation lounge windows every morning because, she said, \"The guests wake up and the first thing they see should be clear.\" Dot asked if she ever watched the sunrise through the glass she cleaned. Wati said, \"Every morning. It's different every morning. That's why I keep cleaning — to see the next one.\" June wrote it down. It was the best line any of them heard on the trip.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nOn the last evening, the four of them sat on the aft deck and watched the wake. Peggy said, \"We should do this every year.\" Val said, \"We say that every time.\" Dot said, \"But this time we have the cabins booked.\" She didn't. But they booked them the next morning — four inside cabins, same corridor, same ship. Because the ship was their age, and aging together, even for ten days at a time, was easier than aging alone.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nTariq called the special dietary line before booking. Celebrity confirmed halal options were available in the main dining room with advance notice. In practice, Trellis handled it unevenly. The first two nights, Samira's halal-marked meals arrived correctly. On night three, the wrong dish came. Their waiter caught it before Samira did and replaced it within minutes — not with an apology speech, but with the correct plate and a quiet \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Khan.\" After that, he personally confirmed each order with the kitchen. The system failed; the waiter didn't.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nTariq and Samira have three children: Aisha, 17; Omar, 15; and Zayn, 13. They chose the Greek Islands itinerary because Aisha was studying ancient history at A-level and had asked, specifically, for Athens. They chose Infinity over a mega-ship because the reviews said it was calmer, and Zayn — who has sensory sensitivities — does better in lower-stimulation environments. Embarkation at Piraeus was crowded and hot. Zayn put on noise-cancelling headphones and held Samira's hand. Once aboard, the ship's volume dropped and he took them off.\n\n## The Real Talk\nInfinity is not a family ship. There's no waterslide, no FlowRider, no teen program worth mentioning. Omar said, \"This is a ship for grandparents\" on day one and wasn't entirely wrong. But Aisha found the Sky Observation Lounge and read there every afternoon. Omar found the basketball court on the Sports Deck and played with a kid from São Paulo whose family was equally stranded. Zayn found the Solarium, which was quiet, warm, and free of the pool deck's competing music.\n\nTwo veranda staterooms, connecting door. The cabins were dated — white walls, original fixtures, limited storage for five people's luggage. Samira organized everything into packing cubes and labeled each shelf. The bathrooms were tight for a family that shares.\n\nTrellis worked when the halal process worked, which was most nights. The Oceanview Café was easier — the buffet format let them see what they were eating, and the international stations usually had identifiable options. Sushi on Five was Aisha's birthday dinner: the chef accommodated a no-pork, no-alcohol preparation without performance.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nZayn's sensory sensitivities are not classified as a disability, but they shape how the family travels. Infinity's smaller size helped: 2,050 passengers generate less noise, shorter lines, and fewer sensory triggers than a 5,000-passenger mega-ship. The Solarium's adults-only policy meant Zayn had a quiet space even on sea days. The library corner near Café al Bacio was another refuge. At the tender port in Santorini, Tariq took Zayn to the tender early — before the main crowd — and the crew accommodated the request without requiring a medical note.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nAt the Oceanview Café one morning, Samira met a crew member named Amina, from Alexandria, Egypt. Amina managed the halal station on themed dining nights and had been with Celebrity for four years. She told Samira she'd started in housekeeping and asked to transfer to food service because she understood how Muslim families felt when they couldn't be sure what they were eating. \"It's not about being difficult,\" Amina said. \"It's about being able to eat without worry.\" Samira said she'd never heard a crew member say that before. Amina said, \"Most crew members haven't been the guest who can't eat the meal.\"\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nIn Rhodes, walking the Old Town, Aisha said, \"This is what I studied.\" Not with excitement — with recognition. The stones under her feet were the ones in her textbook. Omar bought a leather bracelet and argued with the vendor about the price in broken Greek. Zayn sat on a wall and watched the cats. Tariq took a photo of all three of them and sent it to his mother in Birmingham. She replied: \"The ship okay?\" He typed: \"The ship is old. The kids are fine. The crew is kind.\" That was the review.",

She noticed the deck crew hosing the teak at 6 AM, the bridge officers changing watch at predictable intervals, the engine vibration shifting during maneuvering. In Trellis, her waiter was from the Philippines and had been at sea for twelve years. She asked him if he liked it. He said, \"The sea is the same everywhere. The people change.\" Her husband had said something similar, in different words, thirty years ago.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nHelen's husband died eighteen months ago. He'd spent three decades on container ships — Maersk, Evergreen, APL — and came home smelling of salt and diesel. She'd never understood the pull. After he died, she found his journals: port descriptions, weather logs, crew rosters. She booked the 10-night Greek Islands sailing to understand. Not to grieve — she'd done that. To comprehend. Embarkation at Piraeus was chaotic. She looked at the harbor and saw the container terminal across the water and thought: he stood there. Many times.\n\n## The Real Talk\nInfinity is not a cargo ship. Helen knew that. But the rhythms overlap: the watch rotations, the way the bow cuts at cruising speed, the hum of the engines through the lower decks. She booked an inside cabin on Deck 3, the lowest passenger deck, because she wanted to feel the engines. Her husband's cabin had always been near the machinery. She slept better there than she had at home in a year.\n\nThe ship's age comforted her. Her husband's ships were never new. They were maintained, patched, functional. Infinity felt familiar in that way — the worn carpet, the original fixtures, the rust at the pool deck rails. Not neglect. Use.\n\nShe ate in Trellis because her husband had eaten with his crew in the officers' mess every night for thirty years and said the table was what made the voyage bearable. She understood that now. Her tablemates — a retired couple from Oregon and a solo man from Kyoto — became her evening company. The food was adequate. The company was the point.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nHelen has no mobility issues, but she noticed the ship the way a mariner's wife notices ships. The safety equipment was inspected regularly — she checked the lifeboat davits herself, a habit her husband would have approved. The crew drills were visible from the upper decks on sea days. At the tender port in Santorini, she watched the seamanship of the tender operator — the way he held the vessel against the current while passengers boarded — and thought: competent. Her husband's highest compliment.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nOn the aft deck one evening, Helen met a woman from the deck crew — Sonia, from Buenos Aires. Sonia was 32 and one of the few women in the deck department. She'd trained at the Argentine naval academy and joined Celebrity because the merchant fleet had limited positions for women. Helen asked what her husband would have thought of a woman on deck. Sonia said, \"If he was a real mariner, he would have judged me by my knots, not my gender.\" Helen said, \"He would have.\" Sonia showed her a bowline she was practicing — the same knot Helen's husband had tied on every docking line she'd ever seen. Helen asked to try. Her hands remembered the shape from decades of watching.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nIn Kusadasi, Helen watched the ship dock from the open deck. The harbor pilot boarded; the lines went out; the ship eased against the fenders. It was the thing her husband had done ten thousand times. She didn't cry. She stood at the rail and watched the operation with the eye he'd taught her, and she understood, finally, why he'd gone back every time. Not for the water. For the competence. For the crew. For the feeling of a vessel meeting a pier exactly right. She took his journal out of her bag and wrote in the margin: I get it now.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nPhoebe ate alone in Trellis for the first three nights. On night four, the maître d' seated her with a retired professor from Cape Town and a solo woman from Oslo. The professor told stories about fieldwork in Botswana. The Norwegian woman described her divorce with clinical precision and dark humor. Phoebe took mental notes. Her waiter brought bread without interrupting and cleared plates without rushing. At Café al Bacio, the barista made her flat white at 6:30 AM — the earliest he'd served anyone all voyage — and said nothing about the hour.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nPhoebe left her marketing job in July and had a novel draft she'd been avoiding. A friend said, \"Go somewhere with no Wi-Fi.\" Infinity's Wi-Fi is expensive and slow — functionally, for a writer, that's the same as none. She booked the cheapest inside cabin on the 10-night Greek Islands sailing from Athens in October. Late season, few families, and the demographic skewed forty years older than her. That was the point. Nobody would invite her to a pool party. Embarkation was functional. She carried a backpack and a laptop.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe ship's boredom was productive. No entertainment worth attending, no nightlife worth staying up for, no social scene aimed at her demographic. By day two she'd established a routine: write from 6 AM to noon in the Sky Observation Lounge (empty, quiet, ocean-facing), lunch at the Oceanview Café, port in the afternoon if it interested her, write again from 5 to 7 PM, dinner in Trellis. She produced more in ten days than she had in the previous three months.\n\nHer inside cabin was small, dark, and perfect for sleep. The Wi-Fi was too slow for streaming, which meant no Netflix spiral at midnight. The mattress sagged. She didn't notice — she was asleep within minutes of lying down, which hadn't happened at home in years.\n\nThe onyx staircase was the one thing on the ship that stopped her mid-thought. She sat on the mezzanine above it and wrote a scene she'd been stuck on for weeks. The amber light through the onyx gave her the image she needed.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nPhoebe has no disability, but she noticed the ship's quiet spaces the way a writer notices rooms. The Sky Observation Lounge before 9 AM was the best workspace she'd found in years — no background music, no chatter, just ocean and glass. The library corner near Café al Bacio was a secondary option. The Solarium was warm and silent before 10 AM. For anyone who needs low stimulation — whether from neurodivergence, grief, or simply preference — Infinity's unpopularity with younger crowds was itself an accessibility feature.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nIn the Sky Observation Lounge one morning, the cleaner — a woman named Nina from Rijeka, Croatia — asked Phoebe what she was writing. Phoebe said a novel. Nina said, \"About what?\" Phoebe said she wasn't sure yet. Nina laughed. \"That's honest,\" she said. She told Phoebe she'd wanted to study literature in Zagreb but the money wasn't there. She'd been at sea for three years, reading a book a week from the crew library. \"I read more here than I would have at university,\" she said. \"The difference is nobody gives me a grade.\" Phoebe asked what she was reading. Nina said, \"Elena Ferrante. Again.\" Phoebe said, \"Me too.\" They talked about Naples and friendship and women who write about women. It was the best conversation Phoebe had on the ship.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nOn the last day, Phoebe counted: 22,000 words in ten days. Not all good. Maybe 8,000 usable. But the dam had broken. The ship hadn't inspired her — it had removed the distractions that prevented her from working. Slow Wi-Fi, no social scene, a cabin too small to pace in, and a dining room that forced her to talk to strangers who became characters. She disembarked in Athens with a draft and a sunburn and the name of a Croatian cleaner who read Ferrante. That was enough.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nRoss and Kendra requested a visual alert system for their cabin at booking. Celebrity installed a door-knock light and connected the fire alarm to a bed-shaker before embarkation. In Trellis, their waiter learned within two nights to approach from the front, make eye contact before speaking, and write down specials on a notepad when the reading was complex. He wasn't trained for this. He adapted. At the Martini Bar, the bartender pointed to bottles rather than reciting options and slid a cocktail menu across the bar. Small adaptations, none scripted.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nRoss and Kendra are both profoundly deaf from birth. They communicate in BSL and read lips in English. They've sailed once before — a Caribbean cruise on a newer ship that had better technology but worse crew awareness. They booked the 10-night Greek Islands sailing from Athens because Kendra wanted to see Santorini and Ross wanted to test whether a Millennium-class ship could handle deaf guests without a dedicated accessibility program. Embarkation at Piraeus was chaotic and entirely auditory — announcements over speakers, no visual boards. They missed two announcements and found their cabin by deck plan, not by instruction.\n\n## The Real Talk\nInfinity was not built for deaf passengers. The emergency announcement system is audio-only in public spaces. The show lounge has no captioning. The safety drill relied on verbal instruction — Kendra read the officer's lips and signed the summary to Ross, who was standing behind a pillar and couldn't see. This is not acceptable. It is, however, the reality on a ship built in 2001.\n\nWhat compensated was the crew. Once the stateroom attendant understood that knocking was useless, he texted their cabin phone (which had a visual alert) before entering. The guest services desk assigned them a crew member — not a sign language interpreter, but a coordinator who ensured they received written versions of daily programs and port information. The onyx staircase was visible from multiple decks, and they used it as a landmark — deaf navigation relies on visual anchors, and the glowing amber was the best one aboard.\n\nTheir veranda stateroom was dated but functional. The visual door alert worked. The fire alarm bed-shaker worked. The cabin itself was the same white-wall, original-fixture room every Millennium-class guest gets.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nThis is the section that matters most for Ross and Kendra. The ship's accessibility for deaf guests is a patchwork: some things work, some don't. Elevators have visual floor indicators — good. The buffet has no labels on some stations — Ross guessed wrong twice and ended up with dishes he didn't want. The tender port announcements are audio-only — Kendra watched other passengers stand and followed them. The pool deck lifeguard uses a whistle that they cannot hear — a flag system would be safer. Ross documented everything and emailed Celebrity's accessibility team from the ship's business center. The reply was polite and noncommittal.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nAt guest services on day three, Kendra met a crew member named Thea, from Thessaloniki. Thea had been assigned as their coordinator and spoke no BSL, but she'd learned fingerspelling overnight from a YouTube tutorial. It was rudimentary — she could spell names and simple words — but the effort was unmistakable. Kendra signed \"thank you\" and Thea copied the gesture accurately. Over the next seven days, Thea delivered written schedules, reserved front-row seats at shows so they could lip-read the performers, and texted port arrival times to their cabin. On the last day, Kendra taught her the BSL sign for \"friend.\" Thea practiced it three times until Kendra nodded.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nRoss's verdict: the ship is not accessible for deaf guests by design. It is accessible by crew effort. That's not sustainable — it depends on individual people rather than systems. But for this sailing, with this crew, it worked. Kendra's verdict: she'd sail again, but only if Celebrity installs visual alert systems in public spaces and captions in the show lounge. Until then, the Aegean was worth the friction. Santorini at sunrise doesn't require sound.",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrank watched the crew the way he'd inspected divisions for thirty years. The deck crew's morning wash-down started at 0545 and followed a pattern — port to starboard, forward to aft. The Trellis waitstaff briefed before each service; he could see them through the glass partition. His own waiter was punctual, organized, and didn't waste words. Frank respected that. The bridge officers he saw on the observation deck carried themselves with the posture of professionals. He couldn't inspect the bridge itself — civilian ships don't allow that — but the visible indicators were satisfactory.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nFrank retired from the Royal Navy as a Commander. He's sailed on destroyers, frigates, and a carrier. His wife had wanted to cruise; she died before they could. He booked the 11-night Canary Islands sailing from Barcelona in November because his wife had circled it in a brochure two years ago. The brochure was still on the kitchen counter. Embarkation was civilian-chaotic — no muster order, no efficiency, passengers milling. He boarded, found his cabin, and stowed his gear in twelve minutes.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe ship is not a warship. Frank knew that. But he measured it against the only standard he had. The hull maintenance was fair — some rust at the pool deck level, consistent with a ship of this age and operating tempo. The corridors were clean. The elevators functioned reliably. The emergency stations were marked clearly. The lifeboat davits looked recently serviced.\n\nHis inside cabin on Deck 6 was smaller than his cabin on a frigate but better furnished. The mattress was adequate. The bathroom was tight but functional. The ship's motion in the Atlantic was more pronounced than the Mediterranean — a pitch-and-roll pattern that peaked off the Moroccan coast. He found it comfortable. Passengers around him found it less so.\n\nTrellis served officer's mess-quality food, which is to say: competent, regular, and unimaginative after a week. He didn't mind. He'd eaten worse for thirty years. The Oceanview Café was faster and he ate there on port days. The Cellar Masters wine bar was the one venue he visited for pleasure — quiet, organized, and stocked with Spanish wines appropriate to the routing.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nFrank has no mobility issues but he carries the awareness of a man who's managed ships with injured crew. The gangway procedures were professional. In Tangier, the crew managed a steep descent in wet conditions with appropriate caution — handrails maintained, crew stationed at intervals, pace controlled. In Tenerife, a passenger using a wheelchair was transferred to the tender with a competence Frank rated as \"above average for civilian operations.\" The Thalassotherapy Pool area had no-slip surfaces well maintained. The emergency lighting in corridors was functional — he checked.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nOn the aft deck one evening, Frank met a woman from the navigation team — Fernanda, from Florianópolis, Brazil. She was a second officer and had been at sea for eight years, first on cargo ships, then Celebrity. Frank asked how she found the transition from cargo to cruise. \"The cargo doesn't complain,\" she said. \"But the passengers wave when we dock. Containers don't do that.\" She told him she'd wanted to command a ship since she was twelve, watching the port traffic from her grandmother's house above the harbor. Frank said his wife would have liked her. Fernanda said, \"Was she Navy?\" Frank said, \"No. She just liked competent women.\" Fernanda laughed and went back to the bridge.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nIn Las Palmas, Frank stood on the upper deck and watched the harbor operations: tugs, lines, the pilot boarding. He graded the docking a 7 out of 10 — the approach was slightly wide, but the recovery was clean. His wife would have said he was impossible. He would have said he was precise. He took the brochure out of his jacket pocket — the one from the kitchen counter — and wrote in the margin: \"Ship is old but maintained. Crew is disciplined. You would have enjoyed the wine bar. I enjoyed it for both of us.\"",

      "markdown": "## Full disclosure\nI have not yet sailed Celebrity Infinity. Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nWill is 24 and has high-functioning autism. He eats the same meal every night when he can control it. In Trellis, their waiter understood by night two that Will would order grilled chicken, rice, and steamed broccoli — every night, no variation. The waiter stopped offering the menu and simply confirmed: \"The usual, Mr. Will?\" Will said yes. The consistency calmed him. Patricia noticed that the waiter never once suggested he try something different. That restraint was not indifference. It was understanding.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nPatricia has traveled with Will since he was eight. Most vacations are road trips — controllable, escapable, familiar. A cruise was a risk. She chose Infinity because it carries 2,050 passengers, not 5,000; because the reviews described it as quiet; and because the Greek Islands itinerary meant predictable port days with consistent weather. Will agreed to try. They booked two connecting inside cabins — dark, small, and controllable. Embarkation at Piraeus was the hardest part: crowds, noise, confusion. Will put on noise-cancelling headphones and followed Patricia's hand signals. Once aboard, the volume dropped. He took the headphones off.\n\n## The Real Talk\nThe ship's low stimulation was the feature. No DJs at the pool. No FlowRider generating screams. No casino noise bleeding into corridors. The Solarium was warm, quiet, and empty before 9 AM — Will went there every morning and sat in the same chair. The library corner near Café al Bacio became his afternoon anchor. The Sky Observation Lounge, before it became a nightclub at 10 PM, was his evening space.\n\nThe routines that emerge on a cruise ship — same dining time, same table, same waiter, same route from cabin to pool to lounge — are the routines that help Will function. The ship didn't design this for autistic guests. It designed it for elderly guests who like predictability. The overlap was accidental and useful.\n\nThe cabin was fine. Will preferred the inside cabin's darkness — no unexpected light from a balcony, no variable view to process. The engine hum was steady and soothing. He slept ten hours the first night.\n\n## Accessibility on the Seas\nAutism is not listed in most cruise accessibility programs. Celebrity's website mentions sensory-friendly offerings on newer ships but not on the Millennium class. Patricia found the accommodations were informal: the guest services desk noted Will's sensitivities and ensured their cabin was away from the elevator bank. The stateroom attendant knocked at the same time each day — predictability as accommodation. At tender ports, Patricia requested early boarding to avoid the crowd; the crew agreed without requiring documentation.\n\nThe challenges were real. The pool deck on sea days was unpredictable — music, announcements, competing conversations. Will avoided it. The Oceanview Café at peak hours was too loud; they ate early or late. Formal nights were difficult — the changed routine and the louder dining room required preparation. Patricia briefed Will each morning on what the day would hold. The ship's printed daily program helped.\n\n## A Female Crewmate's Perspective\nOn a sea day, Will was sitting alone in the Solarium when a spa attendant — a woman named Hana, from Nagoya, Japan — brought him a glass of water without being asked. Will startled. Hana stepped back immediately and bowed slightly — an apology without words. Patricia, watching from nearby, came over. Hana said, \"I'm sorry. I should have approached from the front.\" Patricia asked how she knew. Hana said, \"My younger brother is autistic. I learned to approach from where he can see me.\" She paused. \"Your son sits in the same chair every morning. My brother does the same thing at home. The same chair means safe.\" Patricia said, \"Yes.\" Hana brought the water again — this time from the front, at Will's eye level. He took it and said, \"Thank you.\" Hana said, \"You're welcome, sir. Same time tomorrow?\" Will said, \"Yes.\"\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nOn the last morning, Will said, \"I want to come back.\" Patricia asked what he liked. He thought for twelve seconds — she counted — and said, \"The chair in the Solarium. The chicken at dinner. The quiet.\" Three things. All predictable. All available on this specific ship because it's old enough to be boring and small enough to be calm. Patricia booked a return sailing for the following September. Same ship. Same cabin number. Same chair.",
