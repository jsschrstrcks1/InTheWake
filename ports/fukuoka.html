        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The ramen arrived in a bowl so rich it seemed to glow. Milky white pork bone broth with a slick of fat glistening on the surface, impossibly thin straight noodles swimming beneath, chashu pork sliced with surgical precision, a scattering of green onion and pickled ginger for contrast. The smell hit me before the first bite—deep and savory and ancient, the essence of pig bones simmered for eighteen hours until they surrendered their souls to the pot. I understood immediately why Fukuoka obsesses over this dish. This wasn't merely soup. This was a confession of faith, a bowl of liquid devotion to the craft of nourishment.</p>

            <p>We'd arrived that morning, the ship sliding into Hakata Port as fog lifted from the harbor. Fukuoka—Japan's gateway to Asia, closer to Seoul than to Tokyo—announced itself with an energy different from the other Japanese ports we'd visited. The terminal buzzed with efficiency: shuttle buses waiting, maps in perfect English, signs pointing toward the train station and beyond. This city has welcomed travelers for centuries, first from China and Korea across the narrow strait, now from cruise ships carrying curious passengers seeking authentic Japan beyond the postcard clichés.</p>

            <p>Kushida Shrine became our first stop, and I'm grateful it was. The ancient Shinto sanctuary sits in the heart of the old district, vermillion gates framing a courtyard where visitors pause to purify themselves at stone basins before approaching the altar. The Yamakasa festival floats—massive decorated towers used in the famous July race—stand on permanent display inside, their elaborate designs depicting warriors and dragons and mythical scenes. My wife and I watched an elderly man perform his morning prayers, bowing twice, clapping twice, bowing once more. The ritual seemed to slow time around him. The smell of incense drifted through the compound, mixing with the cool morning air.</p>

            <p>The yatai—those legendary mobile food stalls that line the riverbank each evening—were setting up as we explored Nakasu Island. By day, the district looks almost ordinary: office buildings, small shops, the usual urban bustle. However, by dusk, something transforms. Men wheel their tiny kitchens to designated spots, unfold canvas walls, arrange plastic stools for eight or ten customers maximum, and begin cooking. We returned that night to experience it properly. The scene felt like stepping into an earlier Japan, intimate and wonderfully human-scaled, the warmth of each stall glowing against the dark water.</p>

            <p>Our chef spoke no English, and we spoke no Japanese. It didn't matter. He gestured to his menu board, we pointed, he cooked, we ate, and somehow communication happened through shared delight in food well made. Grilled chicken skewers glistening with tare sauce. Mentaiko—the spicy pollock roe that Fukuoka claims as its own—piled on rice. More ramen, because in Fukuoka there's always room for more ramen. The man next to me was a businessman from Tokyo who declared this particular stall the best yakitori south of Osaka, without question. He bought us sake to celebrate. By the end of that magical evening, we were all laughing at jokes none of us fully understood.</p>

            <p>Dazaifu Tenmangu the next morning provided contrast—Japan's most important shrine dedicated to learning, where students come to pray before exams and visitors walk through groves of plum trees that bloom each February. We took the train from Tenjin, watching the suburbs give way to smaller towns, the landscape becoming greener and quieter the farther we traveled from the city. The approach winds through a shopping street selling umegaemochi—sweet rice cakes grilled right in front of you, their caramelized surfaces crackling as vendors handed them over wrapped in paper—and past the famous curved bridge that folklore says will cleanse your spirit if you walk across without looking back. The main hall gleams with gold leaf and silk curtains. Incense smoke rose from bronze censers. My wife wrote her prayer on an ema board and hung it with thousands of others, wishes and hopes dangling in the breeze beneath ancient camphor trees.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That businessman buying us sake, raising his cup to toast strangers, laughing across the language barrier while the chef behind the counter smiled at the scene. My heart swelled watching these brief connections form—people from different worlds finding common ground over food and warmth. I thought about my own language limitations, how they should have isolated us but instead seemed to make every interaction more precious. Tears pricked my eyes at the generosity of strangers. I learned something in Fukuoka about how little we need words when we have food and genuine warmth to share. The ramen was extraordinary, but that moment of connection—that's what I carry home. I felt blessed and grateful to have been welcomed so warmly.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Hakata Port International Terminal, a modern facility about 15 minutes by taxi from central Fukuoka. The terminal has basic amenities—restrooms, small shops, tourist information with English-speaking staff. Many cruise lines provide complimentary shuttle buses to Hakata Station or Canal City shopping complex. The port efficiently handles arriving passengers with typical Japanese organization.</p>

            <p>Currency is Japanese Yen (JPY). Current exchange rate is approximately $1 USD = 145-150 JPY. Credit cards are increasingly accepted at larger establishments, but Japan remains more cash-dependent than other developed nations. Bring yen or use ATMs at convenience stores (7-Eleven, FamilyMart) which accept international cards. Prices are moderate by Japanese standards: expect to pay ¥800-1200 ($5-8 USD) for ramen, ¥2000-3000 ($13-20 USD) for yatai dinner, ¥500-800 ($3-5 USD) for temple admission.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Central Fukuoka is flat and walkable with excellent sidewalks. The train/subway system is efficient and clearly signed in English. Distances between attractions are manageable. Kushida Shrine and Canal City are walking distance from Hakata Station. Dazaifu requires a 30-minute train journey. Wheelchair access is good at major attractions and on trains. Summer can be hot and humid; spring and fall are ideal.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Ship shuttles:</strong> Many cruise lines provide complimentary shuttles from Hakata Port to central Fukuoka—typically Hakata Station or Canal City. Check with your ship; this is often the easiest option for the first leg into the city. Return shuttles run on published schedules throughout the day.</p>

            <p><strong>Trains and subway:</strong> Fukuoka has excellent public transit. The subway runs from Hakata Station through the city center with clear English signage. Trains to Dazaifu run from Tenjin Station (transfer required at Futsukaichi). Single subway fares ¥210-360 ($1.50-2.50); train to Dazaifu approximately ¥400 ($2.75) each way. IC cards (Nimoca, Sugoca) work on all transit and at convenience stores. <strong>Independent</strong> travel is straightforward.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Offer <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and guided context in English. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($80-150) typically cover temples, shrines, and food experiences with commentary. Good for those uncertain about navigating independently. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for cooking classes or specialized food tours. For basic exploration, <strong>independent</strong> travel is easy and rewarding.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available and metered. Clean, safe, and drivers are honest. Approximately ¥1500-2000 ($10-14 USD) from port to Hakata Station. Have your destination written in Japanese—hotels and tourist offices can provide destination cards. Taxi doors open automatically; don't pull them.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Excellent in central Fukuoka. The area around Hakata Station, Canal City, Tenjin shopping district, and Nakasu entertainment zone are all walkable from each other (15-20 minutes between areas). Sidewalks are immaculate. Traffic signals have audio for visually impaired. Maps are posted at major intersections.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Japan generally excels at accessibility. Trains and subways have elevators and tactile flooring. Major attractions have accessible routes. Temple grounds may have gravel and steps in places—inquire at entrance gates. Most modern buildings are fully accessible. Station staff will assist with ramps for wheelchair boarding on trains.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Fukuoka offers temples, shrines, outstanding food, and urban exploration. Most cruise calls (8-10 hours) allow time to experience the city's highlights including a ramen meal. <strong>Independent</strong> travel works beautifully here—transit is excellent and the city is foreigner-friendly. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> add value for those wanting guided context. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for cooking classes or food tours.</p>

            <h3>Hakata Ramen Quest</h3>
            <p>Fukuoka is ground zero for tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen. Seek out famous shops like Shin Shin, Ichiran (with private booths), or Ippudo near Hakata Station. Or simply follow the smell to any promising storefront. Bowls cost ¥800-1200 ($5-8 USD). Order kaedama (extra noodles) if you finish hungry. <strong>Independent</strong> quest requires no booking—most shops have picture menus. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> may include guided ramen tours with multiple tastings. Low stamina. Allow 1-2 hours for proper appreciation. This is non-negotiable in Fukuoka.</p>

            <h3>Kushida Shrine</h3>
            <p>Ancient Shinto sanctuary in the heart of Hakata, home to the Yamakasa festival floats. Free entry to the main compound; small fee for festival float hall. Beautiful vermillion architecture, peaceful atmosphere even during busy hours. Walking distance from Hakata Station (10-15 minutes) or short subway ride. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy. Low stamina—mostly flat with some steps. Allow 45-60 minutes. Morning visits are quietest. The shrine store sells beautiful omamori (lucky charms).</p>

            <h3>Canal City Hakata</h3>
            <p>Massive shopping and entertainment complex with canal running through multiple levels. Shops, restaurants, cinema, and regular fountain shows. Ramen Stadium on the fifth floor features multiple regional ramen styles. Free entry; spending is optional. Walking distance from port shuttle drop-off or Hakata Station. <strong>Independent</strong> visit straightforward. Low stamina—climate controlled, accessible. Allow 2-3 hours for browsing and eating. Good rainy day option.</p>

            <h3>Dazaifu Tenmangu</h3>
            <p>Japan's most important shrine to Tenjin, patron of learning. Students flock here before exams; visitors come for beautiful architecture and serene atmosphere. Famous curved bridge, ancient plum groves, adjacent Kyushu National Museum. Train from Tenjin Station approximately 30 minutes (change at Futsukaichi); fare approximately ¥400 ($2.75) each way. <strong>Independent</strong> day trip easy. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($80-120) include transport and guided commentary. Low to moderate stamina. Allow 3-4 hours including transit.</p>

            <h3>Yatai Evening Experience</h3>
            <p>Fukuoka's famous mobile food stalls open along the Naka River as darkness falls. Each stall seats 8-10 customers maximum; the intimacy is the point. Expect yakitori, ramen, oden, and whatever the chef specializes in. Budget ¥2000-3000 ($13-20 USD) per person including drinks. Nakasu Island has the highest concentration. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration requires no booking—simply find a stall with empty seats and sit down. Best experienced after 7pm. Low stamina. Allow 2-3 hours for full experience. Language barrier is minimal—pointing works fine.</p>

            <h3>Ohori Park</h3>
            <p>Beautiful urban park surrounding a lake, perfect for peaceful walks or renting paddle boats. Japanese garden within the park requires small admission (¥250). Walking distance from Ohori-koen subway station. <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy. Low stamina—flat paths around the lake. Allow 1-2 hours. Good option if seeking quiet natural space between urban attractions.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Gateway to Asia:</strong> Fukuoka's position—closer to Busan, South Korea than to Tokyo—has shaped its character for millennia. This was Japan's window to the Asian mainland, receiving Buddhism, writing systems, trade goods, and cultural influences centuries before they reached the rest of the country. Today, ferries to Korea depart regularly; Korean tourists are common. The city carries a cosmopolitan energy distinct from the islands' interior, a sense of being connected to the wider world.</p>

            <p><strong>Hakata vs. Fukuoka:</strong> The city has two names reflecting its two souls. "Hakata" refers to the traditional merchants' quarter and port area; "Fukuoka" was the samurai castle district. When the cities merged in 1889, the samurai won the naming rights, but the merchants kept their identity for the old town, the ramen, and the station. Locals still distinguish between Hakata-style and Fukuoka-style. Understanding this helps you understand the city's dual nature: commercial and martial, practical and proud.</p>

            <p><strong>Tonkotsu devotion:</strong> Hakata-style ramen—creamy white pork bone broth with straight thin noodles—has become Japan's most famous regional style, exported worldwide. The local obsession runs deep. Shops guard recipes jealously. Arguments over the best shop can last for hours. The noodles are ordered by firmness (kata for firm, barikata for very firm); finishing your bowl earns you kaedama—extra noodles dropped into remaining broth. This isn't just soup; it's civic identity simmered into edible form.</p>

            <p><strong>Yamakasa festival:</strong> Every July, teams of men race through the streets carrying massive decorated floats called yamakasa, competing for the fastest time over a five-kilometer course. The festival dates to 1241 and draws hundreds of thousands of spectators. Year-round, two floats stand in Kushida Shrine for visitors to admire. The craftsmanship is extraordinary—each float weighs over a ton and takes months to decorate with silk, gold, and painted figures depicting samurai legends and local myths.</p>
