## 📋 CRITICAL: Task Tracking Protocol

**UNFINISHED_TASKS.md is the authoritative tracker of all plans and progress.**

### Task Management Rules

**ALWAYS UPDATE UNFINISHED_TASKS.md:**
- ✅ When you complete a task → Mark it complete with ✅ and date
- ✅ When you discover new work → Add it to the appropriate priority section
- ✅ When priorities change → Update the priority ranking
- ✅ When you create new files → Document them in the appropriate section

**APPEND, NEVER REPLACE:**
- ✅ UNFINISHED_TASKS.md is a **historical record**
- ✅ Completed tasks move to "HISTORICAL TASK ARCHIVE" section (line 1308+)
- ✅ New tasks are added to active sections
- ✅ Progress summaries are updated with new completion dates
- ❌ NEVER delete completed tasks from the archive
- ❌ NEVER remove historical context

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Check UNFINISHED_TASKS.md for current priority (e.g., P0 #7: Fix placeholder attributions)
2. Complete the task (e.g., update Symphony of the Seas attribution)
3. Update UNFINISHED_TASKS.md:
   - Mark P0 #7 as ✅ complete with date
   - If you created new files, document them in "Files Created" section
   - Add entry to HISTORICAL TASK ARCHIVE if removing from active list
   - Update PROGRESS SUMMARY with new completion
4. Commit with clear message: "FIX: Add proper Wiki Commons attributions to Symphony of the Seas"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Maintains continuity across Claude sessions
- Prevents duplicate work
- Preserves historical context
- Helps user track overall progress
- Enables accurate status reporting

**See:** Section 12 below for detailed UNFINISHED_TASKS.md documentation
