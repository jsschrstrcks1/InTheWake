      "markdown": "**Before Horizon, before Celebrity found its voice, there was Meridian.**\n\n[SS Meridian](/ships/celebrity-cruises/ss-meridian.html) was an older vessel that served Celebrity Cruises during the line's earliest experimental phase. Built in 1963 as the Galileo Galilei for Italian Line, she joined Celebrity in 1990.\n\nMeridian served Bermuda routes, providing Celebrity with Caribbean presence while the line defined what it would become. She was bridge between Celebrity's corporate launch and the Horizon-class ships that would establish the brand.\n\nThe ship was neither new nor revolutionary. She was practical—providing capacity while Celebrity invested in the ships that would define its future.\n\n**The truth:** Meridian represents Celebrity's earliest days, before the line discovered what it would become. A transitional ship serving transitional purposes.\n\nThose who sailed Meridian witnessed Celebrity's infancy. The ship before the beginning.",

The British colonial charm. The overnight stays that would become Celebrity's Bermuda signature. Meridian pioneered the routes that modern ships now perfect.\n\n'This isn't what Celebrity will always look like,' passengers could have observed.\n\n'This is Celebrity while Celebrity figures out who it is,' would have been accurate.\n\n**The truth:** Meridian's Bermuda service established the route. The ship has long departed, but the Bermuda relationship began here.\n\nThose who sailed Meridian to Bermuda witnessed the route's origin. The foundation of a lasting relationship.",
