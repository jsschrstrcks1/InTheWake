          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I stood at the rail as our ship glided into Genoa harbor, the morning air carrying the mingled scents of salt spray and coffee from the waterfront cafés, and thought about young Cristoforo Colombo walking these same quays in 1451, dreaming of horizons beyond what any map could promise. Somewhere a church bell rang the hour, its bronze voice echoing off the pastel buildings climbing the hillsides. The Porto Antico—once one of the busiest harbors in the Mediterranean when the Republic of Genoa ruled these waters—now spreads before me redesigned by Renzo Piano, the aquarium sphere and Bigo panoramic lift standing where merchant galleys once loaded spices and silk. This city built its fortune on the sea: in 1099, twelve Genoese galleys and 1,200 soldiers including fearsome crossbowmen sailed to the First Crusade and helped take Jerusalem, earning Genoa trading privileges that would fuel her maritime empire for generations. Looking at the harbor now, I could feel those centuries pressing against the present moment.</p>

            <p>The historic center starts literally at the dock gates and swallows you whole. Narrow caruggi alleys twist between 12th-century palaces and tiny shops selling sciacchetrà wine and fresh pesto by the kilo. I got happily lost for hours, turning corners that revealed hidden piazzas, ancient churches, and shopkeepers who've worked the same storefronts for decades. The alleys are so narrow that neighbors on opposite sides could lean out their windows and shake hands. I emerged at Piazza De Ferrari just as the fountain started dancing in the afternoon light, its spray catching the sun and scattering rainbows across the marble basin. The piazza is bounded by grand 19th-century buildings—the Teatro Carlo Felice opera house, the Palazzo Ducale—but somehow feels intimate rather than imposing.</p>

            <p>What truly made me catch my breath were the Palazzi dei Rolli—42 magnificent Renaissance palaces recognized as UNESCO World Heritage since 2006. Here's the marvel that still astonishes me: from the 16th through 17th centuries, Genoa maintained an official register called the Rolli, a list of noble palaces grand enough to host visiting dignitaries. When a cardinal or duke arrived, the Senate would select a palace from the register based on the visitor's rank, and that family had the honor and considerable expense of hosting. We toured Palazzo Rosso for €9 and I stood in rooms painted floor-to-ceiling by Van Dyck, Veronese, and Guercino while chandeliers dripped crystals above us. I imagined Spanish ambassadors and French princes being received in these same gilded halls, their carriages waiting in the street below.</p>

            <p>Lunch at Antica Sciamadda changed my understanding of Genoese cuisine forever. The aroma hit me first—wood smoke and roasting chickpeas and something ineffably Mediterranean. Farinata—chickpea flatbread hot from the wood-fired oven—arrived crisp and golden for just €4 a slice, crackling as I broke off a piece. Then trofie al pesto, the twisted pasta hand-rolled in the kitchen, covered in sauce so green it seemed to glow, the fragrance of fresh basil rising in warm waves from the bowl. Made with Ligurian basil that tastes nothing like what grows elsewhere—sweeter, more delicate, almost perfumed. The meal cost €18 total and represented everything I'd been missing at tourist-trap restaurants in other Italian ports. However, the real revelation was the focaccia di Recco—paper-thin layers of dough filled with soft stracchino cheese, fresh from the oven, dissolving on the tongue. I bought extra to smuggle back to the ship.</p>

            <p>In the afternoon I took the funicular up to Castelletto for the panoramic view locals call "the most beautiful in the world." The ticket cost €1.50 each way, and from the viewpoint terrace I could see the entire city spreading below—red rooftops cascading down to the harbor, church domes punctuating the skyline, the Lanterna lighthouse standing sentinel in the distance. The Mediterranean stretched to the horizon, impossibly blue. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected gift—a city I'd nearly skipped, now among my favorites in all of Italy. Tears pricked my eyes at how much beauty the world contains when we're willing to look beyond the obvious destinations.</p>

            <p>Before leaving, I walked past the Casa di Colombo, the reconstructed house where Columbus was born, its modest stone walls a humble beginning for a man whose ambition would mirror his city's own seafaring audacity. The original house was destroyed in a 1684 bombardment, but this careful reconstruction stands as a pilgrimage site for those who understand that Genoa gave the world its most consequential explorer. I touched the ancient stones and felt thankful to be standing where history began. This is what I learned in Genoa: that the cities which shaped the world are not always the ones that appear on every tourist itinerary, that sometimes the greatest treasures hide in plain sight, waiting for those blessed enough to discover them.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Genoa is one of the few major Italian ports where you literally step off the ship into the old town. The cruise terminal at Porto Antico sits within the redesigned harbor area, adjacent to the Aquarium and Bigo lift. From the terminal gates, the historic center begins immediately—no shuttle buses, no long walks, no transport costs. This is rare and precious among Mediterranean cruise ports.</p>

            <p>The terminal facilities are modern and efficient, with ATMs, a tourist information kiosk, and restrooms. Currency is euros; ATMs charge typical international fees. Most shops and restaurants accept credit cards, but carry some cash for small purchases in the caruggi markets. English is less common here than in tourist-heavy Rome or Venice—download a translation app and learn a few Italian phrases. Locals appreciate the effort and respond warmly.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate to high.</strong> Genoa is hilly, and the caruggi involve considerable walking on uneven cobblestones. The funicular to Castelletto eliminates the steepest climb. Some Rolli palaces have stairs without elevators. Wheelchair access is challenging in the medieval center—the narrow alleys and steps present significant barriers. The harbor promenade and Porto Antico area are flat and accessible. Budget 5-7 hours for a thorough exploration.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>On foot:</strong> Walking is the best and really the only way to experience Genoa's historic center. The caruggi alleys are too narrow for vehicles, and getting lost in them is part of the experience. From Porto Antico to Piazza De Ferrari takes 15-20 minutes. To Palazzo Rosso: 20 minutes. To the Columbus House: 25 minutes. Comfortable shoes essential—the cobblestones are authentically medieval.</p>

            <p><strong>Funiculars:</strong> Genoa has several funicular railways connecting the old town to the hills above. The Castelletto funicular (€1.50 each way) climbs from Piazza Portello to the famous viewpoint. Worth it both for the ride and the panorama. The Sant'Anna funicular offers similar hillside access. <strong>Book ahead</strong> not required—just show up and buy tickets at the station.</p>

            <p><strong>Metro:</strong> A single metro line runs through Genoa, but it's not particularly useful for cruise visitors—everything worth seeing is within walking distance of Porto Antico. Save the metro for locals.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> to Genoa are generally unnecessary given the port's walkability. However, excursions to Portofino (45 minutes away) or Cinque Terre (90 minutes) are popular for those who've seen Genoa before. Expect €80-150 for Portofino, €120-180 for Cinque Terre. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Cinque Terre—these fill quickly. Going <strong>independent</strong> to both is possible via train from Genova Piazza Principe station, though Cinque Terre requires careful timing for <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The medieval center presents significant challenges for wheelchairs and mobility devices. The Porto Antico promenade, aquarium area, and waterfront are accessible. Consider hiring a local guide who knows accessible routes if mobility is a concern. Some Rolli palaces have limited access; call ahead to inquire.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Genoa rewards <strong>independent</strong> exploration more than most Italian ports. The walkable historic center, easy navigation, and absence of overcrowding make organized tours less necessary. However, day trips to nearby destinations require more planning. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> provide convenience for outlying areas; going on your own saves money but requires attention to timing.</p>

            <h3>Caruggi & Old Town Walking</h3>
            <p>The medieval caruggi alleys constitute Europe's largest historic center—a maze of narrow passages, hidden churches, and centuries-old shops. Free to explore independently; guided walking tours cost €15-25 through local operators. The best approach: wander without a fixed destination, duck into churches that catch your eye, stop at focaccerie when hungry. The caruggi feel intimidating at first—dark, narrow, crowded—but they're completely safe during daylight and utterly atmospheric. Budget 2-3 hours minimum.</p>

            <h3>Palazzi dei Rolli</h3>
            <p>The UNESCO-listed Renaissance palaces require at least one interior visit. Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Bianco (€9 combined ticket) offer world-class art collections including Van Dyck, Rubens, and Caravaggio. Palazzo Reale (€6) showcases royal apartments. The palaces line Via Garibaldi—once called the most beautiful street in Europe. <strong>Book ahead</strong> not required for most visits; special exhibitions may sell out. Audio guides available in English. Allow 1-2 hours per palace.</p>

            <h3>Castelletto Viewpoint</h3>
            <p>The panoramic terrace above the city offers what locals claim is "the most beautiful view in the world." Take the funicular from Piazza Portello (€1.50 each way) rather than climbing the steep streets. The view encompasses the entire harbor, city rooftops, and Mediterranean horizon. Best in late afternoon when the light turns golden. Allow 30-45 minutes including funicular rides. Free once you reach the viewpoint.</p>

            <h3>Portofino Day Trip</h3>
            <p>The famous fishing village turned celebrity retreat lies 45 minutes from Genoa. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> cost €80-120 and include bus transport. Going <strong>independent</strong> via train to Santa Margherita Ligure (€4) plus ferry to Portofino (€15 round trip) saves money. However, the ferry schedule requires careful attention for <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to the ship. Portofino itself is tiny—2 hours is sufficient unless you're hiking the surrounding trails.</p>

            <h3>Cinque Terre Day Trip</h3>
            <p>The five villages of Cinque Terre lie 90 minutes from Genoa by train. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> cost €120-180 and typically visit 2-3 villages. Going <strong>independent</strong> is possible but complex: train to La Spezia or Levanto, then local trains between villages. The Cinque Terre Card (€18.20) covers trains and trails. Crowds are intense in summer; early starts essential. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for ship excursions. For <strong>guaranteed return</strong>, independent travelers must watch time carefully—the last trains don't leave much margin.</p>

            <h3>Food Tour</h3>
            <p>Genoa's culinary heritage deserves focused attention. Guided food tours (€60-90 for 3 hours) visit focaccerie, pesto makers, farinata specialists, and local markets. Tastings include focaccia di Recco, trofie al pesto, farinata, and local wines. This is the birthplace of pesto—nowhere else in Italy makes it the same way. <strong>Book ahead</strong> through local operators; tours fill especially on cruise days.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>La Superba:</strong> Genoa's historic nickname—"The Proud"—reflects centuries of maritime dominance. The Republic of Genoa rivaled Venice as a Mediterranean superpower, with trading posts stretching from the Black Sea to North Africa. Genoese bankers financed Spanish kings; Genoese admirals commanded fleets across multiple empires. The city's pride shows in its architecture: palaces built to overawe, churches adorned to proclaim wealth, fortifications designed to repel all comers. That pride persists in locals who know their city shaped world history.</p>

            <p><strong>Columbus's shadow:</strong> Cristoforo Colombo (Christopher Columbus) was born in Genoa in 1451, likely in a house near Porta Soprana. His voyages would eventually shift global power from Mediterranean trading cities to Atlantic empires—ironically diminishing his hometown's importance. The Casa di Colombo near the city walls is a reconstruction, the original destroyed by French bombardment in 1684. But the city remembers its son: his portrait appears on everything from chocolates to bus tickets.</p>

            <p><strong>The Rolli system:</strong> The UNESCO-listed Palazzi dei Rolli represented a uniquely Genoese solution to diplomatic hospitality. Unlike kingdoms with a single royal palace, republican Genoa spread hosting duties among its noble families. The official register (Rollo) listed palaces by quality tier—the Senate would assign visiting dignitaries to appropriate residences based on rank. Families competed to build the grandest palaces, knowing assignment to the Rolli conveyed status and obligation. The system created Via Garibaldi's concentration of Renaissance splendor.</p>

            <p><strong>Pesto authenticity:</strong> Ligurian basil grows differently here—smaller leaves, more delicate flavor, distinct from the large-leaf variety common elsewhere. True pesto Genovese uses this basil, pine nuts from the Mediterranean, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Fiore Sardo cheese, garlic, coarse salt, and Ligurian olive oil. The result tastes nothing like commercial versions. Locals claim the air itself contributes to the flavor. Whether or not that's true, pesto made in Genoa surpasses any you'll find elsewhere. Accept no substitutes.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Genoa worth visiting?</summary>
              <p>Absolutely—many cruisers consider Genoa Italy's most underrated port. You get authentic Italian culture, UNESCO World Heritage palaces, Europe's largest medieval center, and extraordinary food without the overwhelming crowds of Rome, Venice, or Florence. If you've seen the famous cities and want something different, Genoa delivers.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can you walk from the cruise port?</summary>
              <p>Yes—Genoa is exceptional among major Italian ports. Ships dock at Porto Antico, literally steps from the historic center. No shuttles, taxis, or transport needed. The caruggi alleys begin at the dock gates, and all major attractions are within 20-30 minutes on foot.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How much time do you need?</summary>
              <p>Budget 5-7 hours for a thorough exploration of the historic center, including at least one Rolli palace, wandering the caruggi, the Castelletto viewpoint, and a proper lunch. If planning a day trip to Portofino or Cinque Terre, you'll need a full port day and careful timing.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Are the caruggi safe?</summary>
              <p>Yes—the medieval alleys are completely safe during daylight hours, despite their dark and narrow appearance. They're filled with shops, restaurants, and locals going about daily life. Use normal urban awareness, but don't let the atmosphere intimidate you. Getting lost in the caruggi is one of Genoa's great pleasures.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What should I eat?</summary>
              <p>Essential Genoese dishes include focaccia (different from elsewhere in Italy—softer, oilier, better), trofie al pesto (this is pesto's birthplace), farinata (chickpea flatbread from wood-fired ovens), and focaccia di Recco (cheese-filled). Budget €15-25 for a memorable lunch at authentic trattorias. Skip tourist restaurants near the port; walk into the caruggi for the real thing.</p>
