      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>The ship squeezes through the 2.7-mile single-lane tunnel with the train tracks — surreal. Whittier is tiny and weird in the best way. We boarded the high-speed catamaran for the 5.5-hour 26 Glaciers tour and it delivered.</p>

        <p>Saw more tidewater glaciers in one day than most people see in a lifetime — Surprise, Harriman, Barry, Cascade, Yale, Harvard — calving constantly. The captain pulled right up to icebergs and scooped chunks for onboard margaritas. Sea otters everywhere floating on their backs like tourists, kittiwakes diving, humpbacks breaching in distance.</p>

        <p>Lunch was prime rib sandwich on deck while drifting in College Fjord at golden hour — 16 named glaciers glowing orange.</p>

        <h3>The Town Under One Roof</h3>
        <p>Whittier might be Alaska's strangest town. Nearly all of its roughly 200 year-round residents live in a single 14-story concrete building called Begich Towers — a former Army barracks that now houses apartments, a school, a church, a small grocery store, the post office, and even the police station. The building connects to the school via an underground tunnel so kids never have to walk outside in winter.</p>
        <p>Why live this way? Whittier averages over 200 inches of precipitation annually (rain and snow combined), making it one of the wettest places in Alaska. Winds regularly howl through the mountain pass. The compact living arrangement just makes sense here.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>A Secret WWII Military Port</h3>
        <p>Whittier exists because of World War II. The U.S. Army built this hidden deep-water port in 1943 as a secret supply route to interior Alaska — the surrounding mountains concealed it from potential enemy detection. Named the "Port of Embarkation," it funneled troops and supplies via rail through a tunnel blasted through the Chugach Mountains. After the war, the military presence faded, but the town remained as a gateway to Prince William Sound.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>The Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel</h3>
        <p>Getting to Whittier by land means passing through the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel — at 2.5 miles, it's the longest combined rail and highway tunnel in North America. Here's the catch: it's single-lane and shared with the Alaska Railroad, so traffic alternates direction every 30 minutes. If you're taking a bus excursion to Anchorage (about 60 miles away), you'll experience this engineering marvel firsthand. The tunnel opened to vehicles in 2000; before that, cars drove onto flatbed railcars to make the passage.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Gateway to Prince William Sound</h3>
        <p>Whittier's real draw is what lies beyond the harbor. Prince William Sound contains the largest concentration of tidewater glaciers in North America — massive rivers of ice that flow directly into the sea. The protected waters here stay remarkably calm compared to open ocean, making glacier viewing accessible even for those prone to seasickness.</p>
        <p>The glaciers here are named for Ivy League colleges (Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth) and notable figures (Harriman, Barry, Surprise). Watching house-sized chunks of ice calve off and crash into the water never gets old.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Top Excursions from Whittier</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>26 Glaciers Cruise (5-6 hours):</strong> The signature experience. High-speed catamarans operated by Phillips Cruises or Major Marine Tours visit College Fjord and Harriman Fjord, passing 26 named glaciers. Lunch included. Many cruisers say this beats Glacier Bay for sheer glacier density and calving action.</li>
          <li><strong>Sea Kayaking:</strong> Paddle the calm, protected waters of Prince William Sound. Half-day and full-day trips available, often including glacier views and wildlife encounters.</li>
          <li><strong>Portage Pass Trail:</strong> A moderate 2-mile hike with stunning views of Portage Glacier and the surrounding peaks. Trailhead is accessible from town.</li>
          <li><strong>Wildlife Viewing:</strong> Sea otters, harbor seals, Steller sea lions, humpback whales, orcas, puffins, and bald eagles are commonly spotted on boat tours.</li>
          <li><strong>Anchorage Day Trip:</strong> Some cruisers opt for bus or train excursions to Anchorage (90 minutes each way) to explore Alaska's largest city, visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center, or go flightseeing over Denali.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Around Whittier</h3>
        <p>Whittier is tiny — you can walk the entire town in 15 minutes. The cruise dock, small boat harbor, tour operators, and the few restaurants and shops are all within easy walking distance. There's no public transportation because there's nowhere to go except through that tunnel.</p>
        <p><strong>To Anchorage:</strong> The Alaska Railroad's Glacier Discovery Train offers a scenic 2.5-hour journey. Bus transfers take about 90 minutes. Both routes pass through the tunnel and along the spectacular Turnagain Arm.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dress in layers:</strong> Whittier is notoriously wet and windy. Even on "nice" days, temperatures on the water are 10-15°F cooler than on land. Bring a waterproof jacket.</li>
          <li><strong>Book glacier tours early:</strong> The 26 Glaciers cruises fill up fast, especially during peak season. Book through your cruise line or directly with Phillips Cruises or Major Marine Tours.</li>
          <li><strong>Bring binoculars:</strong> Wildlife is everywhere — you'll want a closer look at sea otters, puffins, and glacial features.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasickness:</strong> Prince William Sound is protected and generally calm, but if you're sensitive, take precautions before the boat tour.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited services:</strong> There's one small grocery, a couple of restaurants, and a gift shop or two. Don't expect extensive shopping.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash is useful:</strong> Some small vendors may not take cards.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> If your ship arrives early, the 26 Glaciers tour typically departs mid-morning and returns mid-afternoon — perfectly timed for cruise schedules.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Whittier worth visiting?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely. Many cruisers rate the 26 Glaciers tour as the best glacier experience in Alaska — even better than Glacier Bay for active calving. The quirky town itself is a conversation starter.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What's the best excursion?</strong><br/>A: The 26 Glaciers cruise with Phillips or Major Marine is the clear winner. Five to six hours of non-stop glacier viewing, wildlife, and included lunch.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I explore on my own?</strong><br/>A: Yes, but there's not much to the town itself. Walking around takes 15-20 minutes. The magic is on the water.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is it worth going to Anchorage?</strong><br/>A: If you've never been to Alaska's largest city, it's worth considering. But most cruisers find the glacier tours a better use of limited port time.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What's the weather like?</strong><br/>A: Expect rain, mist, or overcast skies — Whittier sees over 200 inches of precipitation annually. Sunny days happen but aren't guaranteed.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Why does everyone live in one building?</strong><br/>A: Begich Towers is a former Army barracks. With Whittier's brutal weather (wind, rain, snow), consolidated living just makes practical sense. It's one of Alaska's most unusual communities.</p>

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Whittier is bizarre (everyone lives in one Soviet-looking building) but Prince William Sound's 26 Glaciers tour is arguably the best glacier day in Alaska — more calving than Glacier Bay for many people.
