Until I do, this Logbook is an aggregate of vetted guest soundings, taken in their own wake, trimmed and edited to our standards.\n\n## Intro\nFifty years after standing watch in a very different ocean, I boarded *Adventure of the Seas* from Port Canaveral in **April 2024** with my daughter, son-in-law, and two grandkids. She’s no destroyer—she’s a memory-maker.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nFrom the gangway, crew moved my grandson’s wheelchair like it was precious cargo. A steward tucked a note under our door: “Welcome aboard, Captain.” My chest swelled like it used to at colors.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nRoyal’s app made check-in painless; we were on the Promenade before my coffee cooled. Leaving in **April 2024** hurt more than my knees ever did.\n\n## The Real Talk\nShe's seasoned—some trim shows her years, and Wi-Fi napped mid-Gulf—but smaller ships make faster friends. The [Schooner Bar](/restaurants/schooner-bar.html) became our family's living room. Before sailing, I ran the math on drinks—that [calculator](/drink-calculator.html) saved us more than the package would've.\n\n## Tear-Jerker\nAt sunset, my granddaughter slipped her hand into mine: “Grandpa, now I understand why you talk about the sea.” The wake behind us looked like a stitched-up timeline.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nI came to show them my ocean. The ship showed me my family instead.\n\n*(Sailing window: Western Caribbean — Perfect Day at CocoCay, Cozumel, Costa Maya | **April 2024**)*",

In **June 2024**, I booked a **5-night** sailing to practice joy in small strokes.\n\n## The Crew and Staff\nMy waiter learned I preferred tea over wine. Luz, a steward, said she sketches when she misses home. “We both find God in the horizon,” she told me. I wrote it in my sketchbook.\n\n## Embarkation & Disembarkation\nBoarding felt like opening a fresh canvas; disembarkation felt like signing the corner—work not finished, simply paused.\n\n## The Real Talk\nElevators creaked like old galleries, and the Wi-Fi wasn’t gallery-grade either—but sunsets graded on a kinder curve.\n\n## Tear-Jerker\nOn night three I painted the exact color of my husband’s favorite tie from memory—then realized I was smiling while I worked.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nI didn’t escape grief; I invited light to sit beside it.\n\n*(Sailing window: Western Caribbean — Cozumel, Costa Maya | **June 2024**)*",
