      <h3>Lighthouse Restaurant Review: Guiding Light for Complimentary Dining</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Lighthouse Restaurant is a complimentary main dining room aboard MSC Virtuosa and select vessels. The maritime beacon theme carries through the design, and the restaurant operates with MSC's standard assigned-seating, multi-course dinner format. It shares the fleet-wide rotating menu with other main dining rooms, meaning the food is identical to what you'd find in the ship's partner venues — the difference is atmosphere and table assignment.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The reliable Italian backbone holds: the rigatoni alla Norma (eggplant, tomato, ricotta salata) is a Sicilian classic that the kitchen executes with the right balance of sweet and savory. The minestrone is thick, hearty, and genuinely flavorful. Risotto alla Milanese (saffron risotto) arrives with proper golden color and creamy texture. The grilled sea bream is one of the better fish options, arriving with crispy skin when ordered well. The veal scaloppine with lemon and capers is a strong ordering choice. Where it falls short: the rotating international offerings — Moroccan tagine, Asian noodle bowls, Continental steaks — range from bland to bewildering, as if the kitchen attempted a world tour without a map. The cheese selection at the end of the meal is limited to two or three options. Desserts are most reliable when Italian: the amaretti semifreddo is excellent, while the "international" options (chocolate lava cake, New York cheesecake) taste indistinguishable from each other.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>MSC's assigned-waiter system works well here. The team is efficient, warm, and builds a genuine rapport over multi-night sailings. By mid-voyage, your server can steer you away from the weaker menu items with a knowing smile. Wine service is competent, with the house Italian options offering the best value. First-seating pacing is comfortable; second seating can compress on busy port nights.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The lighthouse theme is subtle — maritime accents, warm coastal lighting, and a design that feels contemporary rather than overtly themed. On Virtuosa, the room benefits from modern design sensibilities: clean lines, comfortable seating, and better acoustics than the fleet's older grand dining rooms. It's a pleasant space that makes nightly dinner feel like an occasion without the cavernous grandeur (and noise) of multi-deck alternatives.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.6/5.</strong> Lighthouse Restaurant is a solid complimentary dining option that benefits from modern ship design and MSC's reliable Italian menu strengths. The rigatoni, risotto, and grilled fish are worth returning to, and the assigned-waiter system creates a personal touch. It loses marks because international menu items are consistently underwhelming and the dessert program lacks ambition beyond Italian classics. <em>Tip:</em> tell your waiter on night one that you trust their menu recommendations — they'll steer you to the kitchen's strongest dishes each evening and skip the weaker international options.</p>
