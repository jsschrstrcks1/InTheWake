      "markdown": "**When the seventh Oasis-class ship launches in 2028, she'll benefit from nearly two decades of refinement\u2014every lesson learned from six predecessors flows into her design.**\n\nThe Oasis-class story began in 2009 with [Oasis of the Seas](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), the ship that proved neighborhoods could organize mega-ship space into manageable zones. Central Park brought real trees to sea. The Boardwalk created carnival atmosphere. The Royal Promenade became the ship's main street.\n\n[Allure](/ships/rcl/allure-of-the-seas.html), [Harmony](/ships/rcl/harmony-of-the-seas.html), [Symphony](/ships/rcl/symphony-of-the-seas.html), [Wonder](/ships/rcl/wonder-of-the-seas.html), and [Utopia](/ships/rcl/utopia-of-the-seas.html) followed\u2014each incorporating operational lessons, guest feedback, and design improvements from those before.\n\nBy ship seven, Oasis class has achieved maturity. The neighborhoods are proven. The traffic patterns are optimized. The entertainment programming is refined. What arrives in 2028 represents the class at peak expression.\n\nFor travelers choosing their first Oasis-class cruise: this seventh vessel offers the concept perfected. The revolutionary has become reliable. The innovative has become expected. But expected excellence is still excellence.",

      "core_insight": "Oasis class remains relevant even as Icon class claims \"biggest ship\" title",
      "markdown": "**Icon class now claims the \"world's largest\" title. Does that make Oasis class obsolete? Not at all\u2014it makes Oasis class the smart choice for many travelers.**\n\n[Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) approaches 250,000 gross tons with 7,600 guests. Oasis-class ships range from 225,000 to 236,000 tons with approximately 5,400-6,600 guests. The difference affects experience significantly.\n\nOasis class offers the neighborhood concept without Icon's scale. Fewer guests mean shorter lines, easier reservations, and more space per person. The neighborhoods remain\u2014Central Park, Boardwalk, Royal Promenade\u2014but with more breathing room.\n\nPricing typically favors Oasis class as well. When Icon class commands premium rates for \"newest and biggest,\" Oasis class delivers proven experience at relatively lower cost. The waterslides work. The shows entertain. The dining satisfies.\n\nThe seventh Oasis-class ship arrives with all these advantages plus 2028 technology and design. She'll be newer than most Oasis-class ships while offering the class's proven formula.\n\nFor travelers evaluating options: Icon class offers unmatched scale. Oasis class offers perfected neighborhood cruising at more manageable proportions. Both are excellent. The right choice depends on what you prioritize.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment. The best ships don't require comparison\u2014they end the search.",
