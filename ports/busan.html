      <h1>Busan: Where Ancient Temples Meet Urban Cool</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
        <p>South Korea's second city defied every expectation. Mountains cascade into the sea, ancient temples cling to oceanside cliffs, and entire hillside neighborhoods have been transformed into kaleidoscopic art installations. Busan isn't trying to be Seoul – it's doing its own thing, and doing it brilliantly. The energy here is different: coastal, creative, proudly distinct.</p>

        <p>This is also Korea's film capital – the Busan International Film Festival draws global attention each October. The city's beach culture, street food scene, and mix of traditional and hyper-modern make it unlike anywhere else in Asia. Where Seoul buzzes with corporate intensity, Busan breathes with ocean air.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Image I Can't Shake:</strong> Haedong Yonggungsa Temple at dawn. The sun rose over the East Sea, gilding the ancient temple perched impossibly on the rocks, waves crashing below, incense drifting through the salty air. A monk struck a bell. In that moment, I understood why people travel.
        </div>
      </div>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Haedong Yonggungsa Temple</h2>
        <p>Most Korean temples hide in mountains. Haedong Yonggungsa sits dramatically on oceanside cliffs, built in 1376 and painstakingly rebuilt after Japanese destruction. The approach descends 108 steps (representing the 108 afflictions of humanity in Buddhism), passing golden zodiac statues and stone lanterns, until the temple complex emerges against an endless seascape.</p>
        <p>The sunrise here is legendary – arrive early if your schedule allows. Even midday, the combination of crashing waves, elaborate temple architecture, and the giant golden Buddha facing the sea is unforgettable. Plan 90 minutes minimum, more if you want to explore the coastal walking path.</p>
        <p>Getting there takes about 40 minutes by taxi from the cruise terminal, or combine public transport (bus 181) with a short walk. Many cruise excursions include this stop.</p>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Gamcheon Culture Village</h2>
        <p>What was once a hillside slum housing Korean War refugees has been transformed into Busan's most Instagrammed destination – a tumbling cascade of pastel houses, murals, sculptures, and art installations. The "Machu Picchu of Busan" nickname isn't quite accurate (it's smaller, more intimate), but the colors and creativity are extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Wander the narrow alleys, find the Little Prince statue overlooking the village, collect stamps in the village passport for prizes at the information center. Local shops sell handmade crafts, and small cafes offer views over the colorful rooftops. Budget 2-3 hours to explore properly.</p>
        <p>The village is a working neighborhood – residents still live here. Be respectful of privacy, keep voices down, and don't climb on private property for photos.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h2>Jagalchi Fish Market & Food</h2>
        <p>Jagalchi is Korea's largest fish market – a seven-story complex plus outdoor stalls where the catch arrives fresh each morning. The ground floor teems with tanks of live octopus, sea squirts, abalone, and fish you've never seen. Point at what you want; they'll prepare it immediately, often still moving.</p>
        <p>For the adventurous: live octopus (sannakji) is a Busan specialty – chopped tentacles that continue writhing as you eat them (chew thoroughly, this is actually important). The upper floors offer cooked options if raw seafood isn't your thing.</p>
        <p>Beyond the market, Busan street food is legendary: hotteok (sweet pancakes), ssiat hotteok (seed-filled version unique to Busan), tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), and endless varieties of Korean fried chicken. The BIFF Square area near Nampo-dong has food stalls everywhere.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Where do cruise ships dock in Busan?</summary><p>Most ships dock at Busan Port International Cruise Terminal in Yeongdo district. The Nampo-dong shopping area and Jagalchi Market are a short taxi ride away (10-15 minutes).</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Busan easy to navigate without Korean?</summary><p>Major tourist sites have English signage. Metro and bus announcements include English. Google Maps works well. Learn basic Korean phrases – locals appreciate attempts at the language.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>What's the best way to see both Gamcheon and Haedong Yonggungsa?</summary><p>With a full port day, you can do both – but they're on opposite sides of the city. Many do Gamcheon in the morning (closer to port), then Haedong Yonggungsa in the afternoon. Taxi or organized tour is most efficient.</p></details>
        <details class="faq-item"><summary>Is Busan expensive?</summary><p>Moderate by Korean standards – significantly cheaper than Seoul or Tokyo. Street food is very affordable. Taxis are inexpensive compared to Western cities.</p></details>
