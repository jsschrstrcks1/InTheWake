[Costa Fascinosa](/ships/costa/costa-fascinosa.html) followed in 2012 as sister ship.\n\nAt 114,500 gross tons and 3,800 passengers, the Favolosa Class represented significant scale increase from earlier Costa ships. The design balanced Italian elegance with mega-ship capacity\u2014proving Costa could grow without losing cultural identity.\n\nThe class preceded [Costa Diadema](/ships/costa/costa-diadema.html) and the Excellence Class ships but remains relevant through continuous updates.

      "markdown": "**I'd convinced myself I would hate cruising. The crowds. The regimentation. The enforced fun. Costa Favolosa proved every assumption catastrophically wrong\u2014in the best possible way.**\n\nMy hesitation centered on control. I plan trips meticulously. Cruises seemed to remove planning entirely\u2014someone else choosing my schedule, my meals, my entertainment. The rigidity terrified me. Costa Favolosa's Italian approach dissolved that fear within hours.\n\nThe embarkation crew noticed my white-knuckle grip on my boarding documents. A steward named Luca approached with espresso\u2014proper Italian espresso, not the watery American version I'd expected. 'First cruise?' he asked. When I nodded, he didn't launch into orientation logistics. Instead, he sat with me for ten minutes, describing not what the ship offered but how Italian cruising philosophy differed from what I'd feared. 'We don't schedule joy,' he explained. 'We create atmosphere where joy happens. Your days belong to you.'\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre impressed me beyond expectation. I'd anticipated cruise entertainment as cheesy and forced. The Costa Favolosa production I attended on night one\u2014theatrical, sophisticated, genuinely entertaining\u2014challenged every assumption. Italian entertainment operates differently than American cruise conventions. The shows respected audience intelligence.\n\nMy pivotal moment came during my first formal dinner. I'd arrived late, confused about seating protocols, dressed inappropriately for the evening's theme. Everything felt wrong. I prepared for judgment, correction, embarrassment. The maitre d' at the Club Favolosa responded with warmth that startled me. He found me a quiet table without drawing attention to my lateness. He explained dining rhythms without condescension. He personally ensured my waiter understood I was new to this world. 'First nights are always uncertain,' he observed. 'By your last night, you'll teach others.' He was right.\n\nThe Samsara Spa provided my first-timer's sanctuary. When ship activity overwhelmed me, I retreated to the thermal circuits. No booking required. No explanation demanded. Just warm pools and quiet spaces where I could process how thoroughly my expectations had failed me.\n\nThe Pizzeria and Gelateria became my comfort zones. When formal dining felt too ambitious, I could always find excellent Italian casual food without protocols. The pizza rivaled what I'd eaten in Naples. The gelato exceeded anything I'd experienced outside Italy. These simple pleasures anchored me when the cruise experience threatened to overwhelm.\n\nMy cabin steward, Rosa, taught me ship rhythms gently. She noticed when I looked lost in corridors and would appear with subtle guidance. She learned my schedule preferences and timed her service to match. By voyage end, the ship felt like home\u2014a home I'd feared would be prison.\n\nFor first-time cruisers: Costa Favolosa offers Italian hospitality that melts anxiety. The theatrical atmosphere entertains rather than exhausts. The staff notices nervous newcomers and responds with genuine warmth. Fabulous isn't just the name. It's the experience.\n\n**The lesson:** First voyages teach what no brochure can\u2014that cruising is less about the ship and more about who you become aboard her.",

      "core_insight": "Costa Favolosa shows veteran cruisers that Italian cruise culture offers distinctive experience American lines don't replicate",
      "markdown": "**After thirty years and countless cruises across American, British, and Asian lines, I thought I'd experienced everything cruise ships could offer. Costa Favolosa humbled me with how much I'd missed.**\n\nThe difference announced itself immediately: the rhythm. American cruises operate on efficiency principles\u2014activities scheduled precisely, dining turnover optimized, every moment programmed for maximum experience density. Costa Favolosa runs on Mediterranean time. The day unfolds rather than executes. Meals stretch without apology. Entertainment starts when atmosphere builds rather than when schedules demand.\n\nDining culture provided my veteran revelation. Thirty years had trained me to eat cruise ship meals in ninety minutes\u2014arrive, order, consume, depart. My Costa Favolosa waiter seemed confused by my initial rushing. 'You have appointment after?' he asked. I didn't. He smiled. 'Then we eat properly.' Three hours later, still at that table, I understood what proper Italian dining meant. My wife and I conversed more during that single meal than we had across weeks of American cruise dinners.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre productions exceeded my experienced cruiser expectations. I'd sat through hundreds of cruise ship shows\u2014talented performers in formulaic productions. Costa Favolosa's entertainment felt genuinely Italian: theatrical, sophisticated, willing to take artistic risks American ships rarely attempt. The shows assumed intelligent audience rather than entertainment-seeking demographic.\n\nMy service recovery experience highlighted cultural contrast precisely. I'd complained about a cabin issue\u2014minor but legitimate concern. Thirty years had taught me that complaints trigger documented processes: form filed, manager notified, follow-up scheduled, compensation discussed. Costa's response bypassed all bureaucracy. The hotel director appeared within an hour, examined the issue personally, made an immediate decision, solved the problem before dinner. No forms. No credits. Just Italian problem-solving that prioritized resolution over procedure.\n\nThe Samsara Spa operated with European seriousness my American cruises never matched. No aggressive upselling. No relentless product promotion. Therapists focused entirely on treatment rather than retail opportunity. I left each appointment relaxed rather than sold to\u2014a distinction that only veteran cruisers fully appreciate.\n\nThe Pizzeria demonstrated casual excellence. Thirty years of cruise ship pizza had lowered my expectations permanently. Costa Favolosa's versions\u2014proper technique, quality ingredients, genuine pride in execution\u2014reminded me what pizza should taste like. The Gelateria offered similar revelation. Italian casual food, done properly, exceeded the fine dining attempts of ships I'd sailed before.\n\nFor veteran cruisers: Costa Favolosa offers genuinely different cruise culture. Italian conventions differ meaningfully from American approaches. If your cruise education happened exclusively with stateside lines, consider yourself still learning. The fabulous standard awaits.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment.",

      "markdown": "**Fifty years of marriage deserved more than standard anniversary recognition. Costa Favolosa gave us celebration that honored our history while creating new memories worthy of the milestone.**\n\nWe'd told Costa about our anniversary reluctantly. Previous cruises had taught us that 'special occasion' flags trigger generic recognition\u2014same card, same cake, same announcement we'd watched other couples receive. We expected nothing different. We were entirely wrong.\n\nOur cabin steward, Marco, asked about our story on the first day. Not pro forma questions for documentation\u2014genuine curiosity about fifty years together. Where did we meet? What sustained us? What did this anniversary mean? His questions startled us into sharing more than we'd planned. He listened completely, asked follow-up questions, and thanked us for trusting him with our history.\n\nThat conversation shaped our entire voyage. Marco had apparently shared our story with his colleagues. Not as data for recognition programs, but as genuine interest that spread through Italian hospitality culture. Crew members we'd never met would congratulate us warmly, ask about details Marco had shared, express admiration for fifty years together. The recognition felt personal because it was personal.\n\nOur pivotal moment came through unexpected service recovery. We'd planned anniversary dinner at the Club Favolosa, requesting the specific table where we'd dined on our first Costa cruise twenty years earlier. The request seemed impossible\u2014who tracks such details across decades? But we'd asked hopefully.\n\nThe table wasn't merely available\u2014it was transformed. The staff had researched our original voyage, found our dining preferences from twenty years prior, recreated the menu we'd enjoyed then. The sommelier had located the specific wine we'd ordered on our first anniversary aboard Costa ships. Photographs from our original cruise\u2014somehow retrieved from company archives\u2014decorated our table. We hadn't asked for any of this. They'd simply listened to what our anniversary meant and responded with Italian generosity.\n\nThe Samsara Spa hosted our anniversary morning. We'd mentioned our tradition of breakfast in bed on anniversaries, expecting nothing more than room service tray. Instead, the spa manager invited us for private breakfast in a quiet treatment room\u2014champagne, pastries, fresh fruit, served overlooking the Mediterranean. 'Fifty years together,' she said, 'deserves beautiful beginning to the day.' The meal wasn't on any menu. They created it for us.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre production we attended that evening somehow acknowledged our anniversary without embarrassing us publicly. The performers had learned our names. During a quieter moment, one singer looked directly at us and dedicated a love song 'to fifty fabulous years.' Our tablemates applauded. We cried. The recognition felt earned rather than manufactured.\n\nDinner became nightly celebration without becoming repetitive. Each evening brought small surprises\u2014different flowers, different aperitivo selections, different desserts the chef wanted us to try. The attention never overwhelmed; it simply continued.\n\nFor golden anniversaries: Costa Favolosa offers Italian hospitality that personalizes celebration genuinely. The staff asks questions and listens to answers. Recognition emerges from understanding rather than documentation. Fifty years together, honored fabulously.\n\n**The lesson:** Milestone moments deserve milestone settings.",

      "markdown": "**The doctors called it burnout. Twenty years of emergency medicine had finally broken something essential. My prescription: rest, therapy, and\u2014unexpectedly\u2014a cruise my therapist thought might help me remember why life extends beyond hospital corridors. Costa Favolosa became my recovery ward.**\n\nI boarded empty. Not sad exactly\u2014emptiness beyond sadness. Burnout had consumed not just my energy but my capacity to feel much of anything. The ship's theatrical atmosphere, its Italian exuberance, felt foreign to my flattened emotional state. I wondered if I'd made a mistake.\n\nThe first breakthrough came through unexpected observation. Watching the crew interact\u2014their genuine warmth, their obvious pleasure in hospitality work\u2014reminded me that professional satisfaction exists. I'd forgotten. Twenty years of understaffed emergency rooms, endless patient suffering, bureaucratic healthcare had erased my memory of work that feeds rather than depletes. The Costa Favolosa staff modeled something I needed to see: people who enjoyed their jobs.\n\nThe Samsara Spa became my primary healing space. I'd explained my situation to the spa manager\u2014burnout recovery, physical exhaustion, emotional numbness. Rather than standard treatment packages, she designed a custom program. Gentler treatments than typical. Extended thermal circuit time. A quiet corner reserved for post-treatment rest. 'Healing happens slowly,' she observed. 'The spa doesn't rush. Neither should you.'\n\nMy pivotal moment came during a particularly difficult day. The emotional numbness had briefly lifted, replaced by overwhelming grief for the patients I hadn't saved, the system I couldn't fix, the younger version of myself who'd believed medicine could heal everything. I'd retreated to a quiet deck corner, crying for the first time in months.\n\nA steward named Giuseppe found me there. He didn't ask what was wrong. He didn't offer solutions. He simply sat nearby\u2014not intrusively close, just present\u2014and waited. After I'd composed myself somewhat, he spoke quietly. 'I see many people recovering on this ship. The sea helps. The food helps. But mostly, having people around who don't need anything from you\u2014that helps most.' His observation struck precisely where I needed it. I'd spent twenty years being needed constantly. Costa Favolosa asked nothing of me except to receive hospitality.\n\nDining became therapeutic ritual. The three-hour Italian meals forced me to slow down\u2014something my physician brain had forgotten how to do. Conversations with tablemates covered topics beyond medicine. I remembered that I had interests, opinions, a personality beyond my professional identity.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre productions provided permission to feel pleasure. I'd forgotten that entertainment could simply delight, that joy was available without being earned through suffering service. The shows asked nothing of me except presence. I could simply enjoy.\n\nThe Pizzeria and Gelateria fed me without judgment. When formal dining felt too demanding, these venues offered comfort food and quiet corners. The staff never questioned why someone chose pizza over multicourse meals. They simply served warmly.\n\nFor those recovering from burnout: Costa Favolosa offers environment where being served replaces constant serving. The Italian warmth demonstrates that hospitality can bring joy rather than depletion. The theatrical atmosphere reminds you that life includes pleasure. Fabulous recovery awaits.\n\n**The lesson:** Medicine cures disease, but healing requires beauty and permission to want things again.",

      "markdown": "**We brought four generations aboard Costa Favolosa—my ninety-year-old grandmother, my parents, my husband and me, and our three children. Eleven family members testing whether Italian cruise culture could hold us together for ten days. It held us beautifully.**\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre captivated every generation differently. Our six-year-old saw costumes and magic. Our teenagers appreciated the theatrical sophistication. My parents recognized Italian performance traditions from their youth. Grandmother wept during a traditional folk performance, remembering her own grandmother singing those same songs. The entertainment spoke across age barriers because Italian culture assumes generations gather together.\n\nDinner at the main restaurant became our nightly ritual. Costa Favolosa's staff understood immediately that eleven people needed flexible seating. They created our family corner—tables configured for conversation across generations, high chairs for the youngest, accessible positioning for grandmother's wheelchair. The three-hour Italian meals that might frustrate American families suited ours perfectly. We talked. We laughed. We remembered family history while making new memories.\n\nOur pivotal moment came during grandmother's ninety-first birthday, celebrated aboard. She'd assumed we'd mark it quietly—cake in the cabin, perhaps a toast. The crew had different plans. They'd decorated our dinner tables with photographs we'd shared throughout the voyage—four generations documented. The chef had recreated recipes grandmother mentioned missing from her childhood village. The Colosseum Theatre performers stopped by during dessert to serenade her with 'Tanti Auguri' while the entire restaurant joined the chorus.\n\nShe cried. We all cried. Ninety-one years of family history celebrated aboard a ship named for fabulousness.\n\nThe Squok Club occupied our younger children when adult time was needed, but Costa Favolosa didn't assume children were always separate. Family activities dominated programming. Cooking classes welcomed three generations simultaneously. The pool deck had space for grandparents to watch while parents swam with children. Italian family culture pervaded.\n\nGrandmother's accessibility needs were met invisibly. Golf cart transportation appeared when distances overwhelmed. Restaurant seating prioritized elevator proximity. Crew members learned her limitations and adjusted without announcement. She never felt like burden—she felt like honored guest.\n\nFor multi-generational families: Costa Favolosa embodies Italian assumption that families belong together. The theatrical atmosphere entertains all ages. The dining culture encourages lingering. The crew notices what each generation needs. Four generations, ten fabulous days.\n\n**The lesson:** Multi-generational travel works when the ship works harder than your family does.",

The ship delivered on its promise spectacularly.**\n\nOur cabin steward, Marco, learned we were honeymooning and began orchestrating surprises throughout the voyage. Rose petals arranged in hearts. Champagne appearing at unexpected moments. But his most meaningful gesture was personal: he shared his own wedding story, showed us photographs of his wife and children, and blessed our marriage with genuine warmth. Italian hospitality means becoming family, even briefly.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre provided our honeymoon's dramatic backdrop. Italian theatrical productions that felt like attending La Scala rather than cruise ship entertainment. We dressed formally, held hands in the dark, wept at performances that spoke to love's complexity. The shows understood that romance includes tragedy and comedy, passion and tenderness.\n\nDinner at the main restaurant stretched three hours nightly without rushing. We learned to linger over wine, to let conversation meander, to treat meals as celebrations rather than interruptions. By voyage end, we'd developed dining rhythm we still practice at home—slower, more intentional, more connected.\n\nOur pivotal moment came through unexpected crisis beautifully resolved. My wife's grandmother's ring—her something old, worn throughout the wedding—disappeared from our cabin. We assumed theft. We panicked. Security investigated. Hours passed with increasing despair.\n\nThe cabin steward found it lodged beneath bathroom fixtures during his deep cleaning. He could have simply returned it without ceremony. Instead, he understood what this ring meant. He wrapped it in tissue paper, placed it in a small box he'd obtained from the ship's boutique, and presented it to my wife with formal flourish. 'Your grandmother's blessing was hiding,' he said. 'It wanted to be found again, so your marriage could continue properly.'\n\nMy wife cried. Marco cried. I cried. A potential honeymoon disaster became story we tell at every anniversary.\n\nThe Samsara Spa provided our daily sanctuary—couples' treatments that left us floating, thermal circuits we shared in comfortable silence, the intimacy that European spa culture creates naturally. The therapists understood honeymoon energy and adjusted their approach accordingly.\n\nFor honeymooning couples: Costa Favolosa offers Italian theatrical romance. The atmosphere celebrates dramatic love. The crew becomes wedding party. The ship's name becomes aspiration for marriage itself. Fabulous beginning, indeed.\n\n**The lesson:** The best honeymoon teaches partnership through both joy and challenge.",

They worried unnecessarily. Costa's crew worried on their behalf—effectively and invisibly.**\n\nThe Favolosa Class scale suited my energy levels. At 114,500 tons and 3,800 passengers, the ship felt navigable rather than overwhelming. I learned my way around by day two. My favorite venues remained accessible without marathon walks. The elevators arrived eventually. I could pace myself without missing experiences.\n\nMy mobility limitations—arthritis in both knees, occasional balance uncertainty—initially concerned me. But Costa Favolosa's crew noticed without my explaining. By day three, assistance appeared at appropriate moments: a steady arm on stairs, golf cart transportation between distant venues, restaurant seating near elevators. Nobody made me feel fragile. They simply made me feel supported.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre entertained me genuinely. Italian theatrical traditions I remembered from my youth—the drama, the music, the emotional intensity—appeared in contemporary form. Early evening show times meant I could attend performances and still reach bed at reasonable hours. The entertainment assumed adult intelligence rather than merely adult presence.\n\nMy pivotal moment came during an unexpected fall. I'd misjudged a step near the pool deck, tumbled awkwardly, and found myself unable to rise. Embarrassment overwhelmed me more than pain initially. I'd become that elderly woman who falls in public.\n\nThe crew response transformed humiliation into care. Within moments, staff surrounded me—not with panic but with professional calm. The medical team arrived quickly, assessed my condition, and determined nothing was broken. But they didn't simply send me back to normal activities. The spa manager appeared, offering complimentary massage to address the jarring impact. The hotel director visited my cabin that evening to check on me personally. My dinner that night included special preparation the chef thought might help—Italian grandmother remedies, he called them, for bodies that have taken tumbles.\n\nI fell. They caught me. That's what family does.\n\nDining accommodated my needs invisibly. Smaller portions without announcement. Softer textures when I mentioned dental sensitivity. Earlier seating times that matched my energy.

Two years later, I booked Costa Favolosa alone—fabulous seemed impossible, but I needed to try.**\n\nThe first evenings in the Colosseum Theatre broke me open. Stefano had loved theatrical performance. Every show reminded me of productions we'd attended together, his hand finding mine in the dark, his whispered commentary that made me laugh. I cried through entire performances initially—not from sadness alone but from the intensity of presence his absence created.\n\nMy cabin steward, Lucia, noticed my grief without my explaining. Perhaps the single occupancy. Perhaps the wedding ring I still wore. She adjusted her service invisibly—stopped leaving the second bathrobe, arranged pillows for one rather than two, created space that acknowledged my solitude without emphasizing it. She left small notes occasionally: 'Tonight's show would have made your husband laugh. I think you should see it anyway.'\n\nThe theatrical atmosphere became my grief ritual. Each performance let me feel emotions I'd been suppressing. Italian drama understands that tears are not weakness—they're participation. The Colosseum became my mourning space where crying was culturally appropriate.\n\nMy pivotal moment came during a particular show featuring traditional Italian love songs. The music reminded me so powerfully of Stefano that I couldn't remain seated. I fled to the corridor, weeping uncontrollably, certain I'd made a terrible mistake coming aboard.\n\nA crew member named Antonio found me there. He didn't offer platitudes or try to fix my grief. He simply sat nearby on a bench, waiting. When I'd composed myself somewhat, he spoke quietly. His wife had died three years earlier. He'd taken this job partly to heal, partly to be surrounded by celebration that might eventually reach him. 'The fabulous feeling comes back,' he said. 'Not the same as before. Different fabulous. But it comes.'\n\nHis understanding—not pity, but fellowship in loss—shifted something essential. I returned to performances after that. I cried, but I also laughed sometimes.

      "markdown": "**Spinal cord injury at forty changed how I travel but not whether I travel. Costa Favolosa proved that cruise ships can accommodate wheelchairs while still delivering genuinely fabulous experiences—not watered-down accessibility versions.**\n\nMy accessible cabin provided real space for my power wheelchair. Turning radius that actually worked. Roll-in shower that functioned properly. Balcony threshold I could cross independently. The room felt designed for living, not merely compliant with regulations.\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre impressed me most. Wheelchair positions offered actual sightlines—not the obstructed corners some theaters provide. I could see performances fully, sitting beside my able-bodied traveling companion rather than segregated to 'accessible' areas. The crew assisted with door navigation without making it dramatic. I attended every show as theatre-goer, not as wheelchair user being accommodated.\n\nDining presented expected challenges—narrow pathways, other passengers' belongings blocking aisles. But Costa Favolosa's staff anticipated these issues. The maitre d' assigned me tables with optimal wheelchair access, explaining his reasoning rather than simply making decisions for me. Waiters cleared paths before I arrived. The chef came to my table personally to discuss any modification needs. My agency remained intact while receiving necessary assistance.\n\nMy pivotal moment came during a port call in Barcelona. The ship's gangway proved challenging for my particular wheelchair—a design incompatibility nobody had anticipated. I'd resigned myself to staying aboard while others explored.\n\nThe shore excursions manager refused that outcome. She spent thirty minutes on the phone with port authorities, arranged alternative accessible disembarkation through service areas, and personally accompanied me to ensure everything worked. The effort she invested—time that could have served multiple other passengers—demonstrated genuine commitment to accessibility rather than minimum compliance.\n\n'Everyone deserves Barcelona,' she said simply. 'We find ways.'\n\nThe Samsara Spa adapted treatments for my seated position. Therapists adjusted tables, modified techniques, treated me as spa guest rather than logistical problem. They asked about my injury's specifics—not intrusively, but to understand how to serve me better. The thermal experiences I could access were thoughtfully modified.\n\nService recovery came when an elevator malfunction temporarily limited my mobility between decks. The crew's response was immediate and dignified—personal escort via service elevator, no drama, no making me feel like burden. The hotel director called my cabin personally to apologize and ensure no further issues occurred.\n\nFor wheelchair users: Costa Favolosa offers theatrical Italian experience without accessibility compromises. The venues accommodate. The crew anticipates. The fabulousness includes everyone.\n\n**The lesson:** Accessibility means equal dignity, not special treatment.",

      "markdown": "**I booked Costa Favolosa alone at fifty, celebrating a career milestone that felt more meaningful than any relationship I could have invited to share it. The theatrical Italian atmosphere made solo travel feel like starring in my own production.**\n\nThe Colosseum Theatre became my evening ritual. Italian theatrical traditions don't require companionship to appreciate—the drama, the music, the emotional intensity speak directly to individuals. I'd dress elegantly, claim my seat, and lose myself in performances that reminded me why solo achievements deserve solo celebration. Nobody questioned why I attended alone. The shows assumed their own sufficiency.\n\nMy cabin steward, Roberto, noticed I was traveling solo and adjusted his service thoughtfully. He stopped emphasizing couples' elements, began leaving notes about solo-friendly activities, and shared his favorite ship secrets—quiet corners for reading, best times for uncrowded spa access, which bars welcomed single conversation. His attention made me feel like valued individual rather than anomaly.\n\nDinner at the main restaurant evolved beautifully. The maitre d' understood solo diners differently than I'd expected. Rather than isolating me at small tables, he seated me with other interesting solo travelers—and more notably, with Italian families who welcomed extras enthusiastically. Italian hospitality abhors empty seats at tables. I was adopted by different groups nightly, practicing Italian, hearing life stories, becoming temporary family member across multiple households.\n\nMy pivotal moment came during a Colosseum Theatre performance celebrating Italian opera highlights. The production included audience participation elements—and the performer singled me out, drawing me into a playful romance scene that ended with theatrical flourish. I should have been embarrassed. Instead, I was fabulous—literally, as the performer announced: 'This lady travels alone because she doesn't need anyone else. She is fabulous herself.'\n\nThe audience applauded. I bowed. My solo celebration became public performance of independence triumphant.\n\nThe Samsara Spa provided my morning sanctuary. Thermal circuits welcome solo visitors without making solitude feel awkward. I'd float in warm pools, processing the career achievement that had brought me here, planning what solo adventures might come next. The treatments addressed years of professional tension—shoulders releasing decades of workplace stress.\n\nThe Pizzeria and Gelateria offered casual meals when formal dining felt too social. Italian casual food served without protocols, without assigned seating, without any reminder that I was eating alone.\n\nFor solo travelers: Costa Favolosa offers theatrical Italian atmosphere that celebrates individuals. The entertainment speaks to solitary appreciation. The Italian hospitality includes everyone at every table. Solo and fabulous aren't contradictions—they're combinations.\n\n**The lesson:** Solitude doesn't have to mean isolation.",
