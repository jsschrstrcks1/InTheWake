      "markdown": "**Silver Moon launched in 2020 as [Silver Muse](/ships/silversea/silver-muse.html)'s sister—entering service during the pandemic that challenged every cruise line's survival.**\n\nThe timing seemed catastrophic. A new luxury ship delivered into a world where cruising had stopped. But Silversea used the pause for refinement. When Silver Moon finally sailed with passengers, she carried lessons from both Muse's operations and the industry's forced reset.\n\nThe Muse Class design carries forward unchanged: 596 guests, eight restaurants, butler service for all suites, comprehensive inclusion. Silver Moon offers the same fundamental experience as her sister with the operational polish of delayed debut.\n\n[Silver Dawn](/ships/silversea/silver-dawn.html) followed in 2022, completing the Muse Class trio. Together, these ships represent Silversea's largest vessels before Nova Class arrival.\n\nFor fleet context: Silver Moon represents resilience—a ship that waited for better times and emerged ready. The delayed launch may have actually enhanced her debut operations.",

      "markdown": "**Silver Moon premiered S.A.L.T.—Sea and Land Taste—the culinary program that now defines Silversea's approach to destination-connected dining.**\n\nThe concept: every region Silversea visits has culinary traditions worth exploring. S.A.L.T. Kitchen serves dishes reflecting current itinerary. S.A.L.T. Lab offers hands-on cooking classes. S.A.L.T. Bar features regional drinks and ingredients. Shore excursions connect to local food culture.\n\nSilver Moon tested what Nova Class would later expand. The program worked—guests responded enthusiastically to cuisine that connected meaningfully to destinations rather than offering generic luxury dining.\n\nThe traditional venues remain excellent. La Dame, Kaiseki, and the other restaurants maintain Silversea's culinary standards. S.A.L.T. adds layer rather than replacing what works.\n\nFor culinary travelers: Silver Moon pioneered what became Silversea's most distinctive dining innovation. The program continues evolving based on what this ship taught.",

      "markdown": "**Silver Moon's Mediterranean deployments showcase why Muse Class scale suits this region perfectly.**\n\nAt 596 guests, Silver Moon accesses ports that larger ships cannot. Historic Mediterranean harbors—Portofino, Kotor, smaller Greek islands—welcome this size comfortably. The intimacy of smaller ports enhances what ultra-luxury travelers seek.\n\nMediterranean itineraries benefit from S.A.L.T. programming particularly well. Italian, Greek, Spanish, and French culinary traditions translate beautifully to onboard experiences. The destination-cuisine connection feels natural rather than forced.\n\nThe passenger demographic on Mediterranean sailings tends cultured, well-traveled, and food-focused. The ship attracts guests who've visited these regions before and want deeper experience rather than overview.\n\nFor Mediterranean priorities: Silver Moon offers the right scale for this region. Large enough for comprehensive luxury, small enough for authentic port access. The combination serves Mediterranean cruising ideally.",
