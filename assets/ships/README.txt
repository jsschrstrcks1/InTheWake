Local ship images & thumbs
For each ship page, you can drop a 1600x900 JPG at:
  assets/ships/<slug>.jpg   (preferred)  or  assets/<slug>.jpg

Grandeur rotation (used on the page and its card thumbnail if available):
  assets/grandeur-of-the-seas.jpg
  assets/ships/grandeur-of-the-seas - 1.jpeg
  assets/ships/grandeur-of-the-seas - 2.jpeg
  assets/ships/grandeur-of-the-seas - 3.jpeg

Ship listing thumbnails (cards) will prefer a local file in this order:
  assets/ships/thumbs/<slug>.jpg
  assets/<slug>.jpg
  assets/ships/<slug>.jpg
If none are present, a Wikimedia thumbnail will be used automatically.
