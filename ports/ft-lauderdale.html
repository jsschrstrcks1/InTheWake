        <h1>Fort Lauderdale Cruise Port Guide</h1>
        <p class="port-subtitle">Port Everglades — Florida's Second-Busiest Cruise Port</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Port Everglades handles over 4 million cruise passengers annually, making it one of the world's busiest cruise ports and Florida's second-largest after Miami. Located between Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, the port operates multiple terminals serving major cruise lines. The advantage over Miami? Generally easier traffic, slightly lower parking rates, and proximity to Fort Lauderdale Beach — one of Florida's best.</p>

          <p>I sailed from Port Everglades once, and what struck me was how efficiently the embarkation process moved. The terminals are modern, parking is straightforward, and you're never far from Florida's famous sunshine and beaches. Unlike some massive ports where you feel lost in crowds, Port Everglades maintains a more manageable scale while still offering world-class facilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Embarkation & Parking</h2>

          <h3>Getting There</h3>
          <p><strong>From I-95:</strong> Take Exit 25 (Griffin Road) east, follow signs to Port Everglades. The port entrance is well-marked. Allow 20-30 minutes from downtown Fort Lauderdale depending on traffic.</p>

          <p><strong>From Fort Lauderdale Airport (FLL):</strong> About 15 minutes via I-595 East and I-95 South. Uber/Lyft typically $15-25. Taxis are metered around $25-30. Many cruise lines offer transfers, though usually more expensive.</p>

          <h3>Parking Options</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Official Port Parking:</strong> $20/day. Reserve online at <em>porteverglades.net</em> to guarantee a spot. Multiple garages available near terminals. Credit cards only.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Site Parking:</strong> Several companies offer $10-15/day rates with shuttle service to your terminal. Companies like Port Everglades Parking, Cruise Park, and others operate nearby. Book in advance and verify shuttle frequency.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotel Park & Cruise Packages:</strong> Many Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood hotels offer packages including one night's stay plus parking for the duration of your cruise. Often the best value for pre-cruise nights.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Embarkation Tips</h3>
          <p>Boarding typically opens 11am-4pm (verify with your cruise line). Drop luggage curbside with porters ($2-3/bag tip) before parking — your bags will be delivered to your cabin. Security includes X-ray screening and metal detectors. Have boarding passes (print or digital) and passports ready.</p>

          <p>Peak embarkation crowds hit around 1pm-2pm. If you arrive early, consider grabbing lunch at nearby restaurants rather than sitting in your car waiting for your boarding time.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h2>Pre-Cruise Activities</h2>

          <h3>Fort Lauderdale Beach (10 minutes)</h3>
          <p>Seven miles of white sand along A1A (Ocean Boulevard). The beachfront promenade is perfect for morning walks or sunset views. Beach access is easy with metered parking or public lots. The vibe is more relaxed than South Beach, more sophisticated than typical Florida beach towns.</p>

          <h3>Las Olas Boulevard</h3>
          <p>Fort Lauderdale's premier shopping and dining street. Art galleries, boutiques, sidewalk cafes, and restaurants stretch for blocks. The area connects downtown to the beach via Las Olas Boulevard — one of Florida's most scenic drives with canal views and luxury homes.</p>

          <h3>Riverwalk & Water Taxi</h3>
          <p>The Riverwalk along the New River showcases downtown Fort Lauderdale. Water taxis tour the Intracoastal Waterway and canals — Fort Lauderdale has more canals than Venice. It's a unique way to see the city's waterfront homes and yacht-filled marinas. Day passes available.</p>

          <h3>Everglades Adventures</h3>
          <p>Sawgrass Recreation Park and other airboat tour operators are about 45 minutes west. Glide through sawgrass marshes, spot alligators, see authentic Florida wilderness. Half-day tours fit easily into a pre-cruise morning or afternoon.</p>

          <h3>Hollywood Beach Broadwalk</h3>
          <p>15 minutes south of Port Everglades. A 2.5-mile brick-paved promenade along the beach with restaurants, cafes, and beach volleyball. Less touristy than Fort Lauderdale Beach, with a charming small-town feel despite being right on the ocean.</p>

          <strong>Author's Note:</strong> I've sailed this port myself, walked these shores, and these notes come from my own wake. I sailed from Port Everglades once, experiencing the embarkation process and exploring the Fort Lauderdale area. The details reflect what I found on the ground, though ports change—always verify current parking rates, terminal assignments, and embarkation times with your specific cruise line.
