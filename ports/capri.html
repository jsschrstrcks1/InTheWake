        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I woke before dawn to find our ship anchored in the Bay of Naples with Capri rising from morning mist like a fever dream—limestone cliffs catching the first pink light, villages clinging impossibly to vertical slopes, the famous Faraglioni sea stacks standing sentinel at the island's eastern tip. The tender ride took twenty minutes, crossing water so blue it seemed artificial, too saturated to be real. However, when I stepped onto the dock at Marina Grande and looked up at the terraced houses painted in yellows and pinks, I understood why emperors chose this rock for their pleasure palaces.</p>

            <p>The funicular from Marina Grande to Capri town rises steeply through lemon groves and bougainvillea, depositing passengers in the Piazzetta—that famous tiny square where the beautiful people sip espresso and watch the world pass. I found a table at Gran Caffè despite the outrageous prices (€8 for a coffee) and did exactly what everyone does: sat and stared. The crowd was a mix of cruise passengers in comfortable shoes and Italian socialites in designer sunglasses, everyone playing their part in Capri's perpetual theater of glamour and leisure. The smell of espresso and jasmine mixed in the morning air.</p>

            <p>I had reserved a Blue Grotto tour for 9:30 AM, and the crew at the motorboat dock warned me the cave had already closed once that morning due to swells. The Blue Grotto entrance sits just above sea level—anything more than a gentle swell makes entry impossible, and even on calm days visitors must lie flat in small rowboats while the oarsman times the waves and pulls the boat through the narrow opening. My group waited nervously at the cave mouth while the boatmen assessed conditions. Then suddenly we were through, sliding into darkness that exploded into the most extraordinary blue I have ever seen.</p>

            <p>The water inside the Blue Grotto glows with an otherworldly phosphorescence—sunlight enters through an underwater opening and refracts upward, turning the entire cave into liquid sapphire. I gasped audibly, unable to process what my eyes were seeing. The boatman sang O Sole Mio in a theatrical baritone while we drifted in that impossible blue, tourists from a dozen countries all reduced to the same stunned silence. My breath caught in my chest. I have seen many natural wonders in my travels, but nothing quite prepared me for this—the blue seemed alive, seemed to pulse with some ancient Mediterranean magic that defies scientific explanation even when the science is perfectly clear.</p>

            <p>From the Blue Grotto, I took a bus to Anacapri, the quieter upper town where winding paths lead past whitewashed churches and terraced gardens. The chairlift to Monte Solaro—Capri's highest point at 589 meters—offered views that made my eyes fill with unexpected tears. Not from sadness, but from the overwhelming beauty stretched out below: the entire island visible in miniature, the Bay of Naples glittering to the north, Vesuvius smoking gently in the distance, the Amalfi Coast unfolding to the south in a succession of cliffs and villages. Nevertheless, the chairlift itself is not for everyone—it's an open-air single seat with no enclosure, swinging gently over olive groves and rocky outcrops. Moderate stamina and comfort with heights required.</p>

            <p>The descent from Monte Solaro led me through Anacapri's peaceful streets to the Villa San Michele, the dream house that Swedish physician Axel Munthe built in the early 1900s. The gardens overflow with Mediterranean plants—lavender, rosemary, cypress—and fragments of ancient Roman sculptures dot the pathways. From the terrace, I watched cruise ships in the bay below and thought about the Roman emperors who once owned this island, about Augustus who traded Ischia for Capri because he loved its beauty so much, about Tiberius who governed Rome from here for the last decade of his life. The island has always attracted those seeking beauty, solitude, and escape from the ordinary world.</p>

            <p>I walked back to Capri town via the Scala Fenicia—the ancient Phoenician Steps that connect the two towns via 921 stone stairs carved into the cliff. The descent took nearly an hour, my knees protesting each step, but the views made every ache worthwhile. The path passed through lemon groves where fruit hung heavy on branches, past ancient walls covered in capers and wild fennel, with glimpses of sea appearing and disappearing as the path switched back and forth. The smell of citrus and sea salt mingled with the sharp green scent of wild herbs.</p>

            <p>By late afternoon, I found myself at Marina Piccola on the island's southern side, watching swimmers dive from rocks into crystal water while the Faraglioni towered overhead. I rented a lounge chair at a stabilimento and spent the final hours of my port day doing exactly nothing—swimming in impossibly clear water, drying in the warm sun, eating a simple lunch of mozzarella and tomatoes that tasted like summer distilled. A woman next to me, perhaps seventy, swam back and forth between the rocks with the easy confidence of someone who had been doing this all her life. She smiled at me when she emerged and said simply, "This is paradise." I couldn't disagree.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That electric blue water inside the grotto, the boatman singing opera, the collective gasp of strangers sharing something beyond words. My heart swelled with gratitude for the natural world's capacity to astonish us, for the simple fact that a cave could hold such beauty. I returned to the tender changed, reminded that some places exceed their reputation, that Capri's fame rests on genuine wonder rather than mere marketing.</p>

            <p>Looking back, Capri taught me that beauty can be worth any inconvenience—the tender operations, the crowds, the prices that would make a Roman emperor wince. What I learned here will stay with me: that some places have been perfecting beauty for millennia, that the Mediterranean still holds magic if you know where to look, and that lying flat in a rowboat to slide into an underwater cave might be the best decision you ever make.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Capri is a tender port for larger cruise ships. Vessels anchor in the bay and tender passengers to Marina Grande, the island's main harbor. Tender operations depend entirely on sea conditions—rough water can delay or cancel port calls. Always have backup plans and don't book anything non-refundable. Some smaller ships may dock directly at the Marina Grande pier.</p>

            <p>Marina Grande offers immediate access to the funicular (to Capri town), bus station (to Anacapri and Blue Grotto), and boat tour operators. The waterfront has cafes, gelato shops, and tourist services. Currency is Euros; ATMs available. English widely spoken. No formal terminal building—this is a working Italian harbor with cruise passengers sharing space with ferries and local boats. Wheelchair accessibility is very limited on this steep island.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p>Capri is a small island but extremely vertical—be prepared for stairs, hills, and walking on uneven terrain. There are no cars for tourists, which is part of the charm.</p>

            <p><strong>Funicular:</strong> The famous funicular connects Marina Grande to Capri town (€2.20 one way, runs every 15 minutes). The three-minute ride saves significant climbing. Lines can be long when cruise ships are in port—go early or late. Low stamina required.</p>

            <p><strong>Buses:</strong> Regular buses connect Marina Grande, Capri town, and Anacapri (€2.20 per ride). Small buses navigate hairpin roads—not for the faint of heart but perfectly safe. Bus to Anacapri takes 15 minutes. Moderately accessible for those who can manage steps onto bus.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Most visitors walk extensively. The island is small but terrain is steep. Comfortable shoes essential—no heels. Scala Fenicia (Phoenician Steps) connects Capri to Anacapri via 921 stairs—high stamina, spectacular views. Piazzetta and shopping areas are flat. Wheelchair accessibility severely limited throughout island.</p>

            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> Convertible taxis (some vintage) offer island tours and point-to-point transport. Prices are regulated but expensive—€30+ for short trips. Good option for groups or those with mobility concerns. Book at Marina Grande taxi stand.</p>

            <p><strong>Boats:</strong> Water taxis and tour boats depart Marina Grande for Blue Grotto, island circumnavigation, and surrounding coasts. Blue Grotto boat tours €18 per person plus €18 grotto entrance. Book ahead for guaranteed return timing; go independent for flexibility.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Capri offers dramatic natural beauty and Italian glamour in equal measure. Ship excursions provide guaranteed return to vessel—important for tender port with unpredictable conditions. Go independent for flexibility, but monitor tender schedules carefully.</p>

            <h3>Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra)</h3>
            <p>Capri's signature attraction—a sea cave where sunlight creates otherworldly blue water. Boat from Marina Grande to grotto entrance (€18), then transfer to rowboat and pay grotto entrance (€18). Visitors lie flat to pass through narrow entrance. Total time 60-90 minutes. The grotto closes frequently due to swells—no refunds if closed. Morning visits offer calmer conditions. Ship excursion guarantees organized timing; go independent for lower cost but accept weather risk. Low stamina but requires lying flat in small boat. Not wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <h3>Anacapri & Monte Solaro</h3>
            <p>The quieter upper town offers gardens, churches, and the chairlift to Capri's highest point. Bus from Marina Grande to Anacapri (€2.20), then chairlift (€12 round trip, €9 one way). Summit views span the entire Bay of Naples. Villa San Michele museum and gardens (€10) near chairlift station. Allow 3-4 hours for Anacapri exploration. Ship excursion available but easy to go independent—just monitor time carefully. Moderate stamina for walking; chairlift requires comfort with heights (open-air single seat).</p>

            <h3>Capri Town & Piazzetta</h3>
            <p>The famous Piazzetta square is Capri's glamorous heart—cafes, luxury boutiques, and people-watching. Funicular from Marina Grande (€2.20) delivers you to the edge of town. Gardens of Augustus offer views of the Faraglioni. Via Camerelle is the luxury shopping strip. Allow 2-3 hours for walking and browsing. No booking needed—go independent and explore at your pace. Low to moderate stamina on mostly flat but crowded streets. Limited wheelchair accessibility due to narrow passages.</p>

            <h3>Island Boat Tour</h3>
            <p>Circumnavigate Capri by boat, passing the Faraglioni stacks, sea caves (weather permitting), and dramatic coastline. Tours 1-2 hours, €20-40 depending on route. Some include Blue Grotto entrance if conditions allow. Depart Marina Grande. Book ahead for specific departure times or purchase dockside for flexibility. Ship excursions combine boat tour with Blue Grotto attempt. Low stamina; suitable for most mobility levels.</p>

            <h3>Marina Piccola</h3>
            <p>The southern cove offers swimming, sun, and stunning Faraglioni views. Bus from Capri town or 15-minute walk down (longer and more challenging going up). Stabilimenti (private facilities) rent lounges and umbrellas (€20-40). Public access areas available but limited. Crystal-clear water for swimming. Allow 2-3 hours minimum to fully enjoy the experience. Go independent—no booking needed for public areas. Moderate stamina for descent/ascent. Partially accessible.</p>

          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p>Capri has attracted admirers since antiquity. Emperor Augustus visited in 29 BC and was so enchanted that he traded the larger island of Ischia for this small rocky outcrop. His successor Tiberius ruled the Roman Empire from Capri during the final decade of his life (27-37 AD), building twelve villas including Villa Jovis whose ruins still crown the island's eastern peak.</p>

            <p>The Blue Grotto was rediscovered in 1826 by German artist August Kopisch and Polish poet Ernst Fries, though locals had known of its existence for centuries. The "rediscovery" launched Capri's tourist industry, attracting artists, writers, and intellectuals throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Oscar Wilde, Graham Greene, Pablo Neruda, and countless others found inspiration on this limestone rock.</p>

            <p>Modern Capri remains expensive and exclusive, but the natural beauty that drew emperors still awaits anyone willing to navigate the crowds and prices. The island has successfully preserved its car-free character and dramatic landscapes despite hosting over two million visitors annually. The tension between accessibility and preservation continues to define Capri's identity.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How do cruise ships visit Capri?</summary>
              <p>Larger ships anchor offshore and tender passengers to Marina Grande. Tender operations depend on sea conditions—rough water can delay or cancel visits. Some smaller ships may dock directly. Always confirm tender status with ship crew before planning your day.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is the Blue Grotto worth it?</summary>
              <p>When conditions allow, absolutely. The electric blue water is genuinely extraordinary. However, the grotto closes frequently due to swells, and even when open, long waits and tight rowboat transfers can frustrate some visitors. Morning offers best conditions. Accept that you may not get in.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I do both Blue Grotto and Anacapri in one port day?</summary>
              <p>Possible but rushed. Blue Grotto requires 90+ minutes including boat time and waits. Anacapri with Monte Solaro chairlift needs 2-3 hours. If your ship has a long port day (8+ hours), both are feasible. With shorter visits, choose one and explore thoroughly.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Capri accessible for mobility challenges?</summary>
              <p>Capri is extremely challenging for wheelchairs and those with mobility issues. The island is steep, with many stairs and uneven surfaces. Funicular has limited accessibility. The Piazzetta and some Capri town streets are manageable, but most attractions require walking ability.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Should I book excursions or go independent?</summary>
              <p>Ship excursions guarantee return to the vessel—valuable for a tender port. Independent exploration offers flexibility and often lower costs but requires careful time management. Book Blue Grotto tours in advance if going independent; monitor tender schedules constantly.</p>
