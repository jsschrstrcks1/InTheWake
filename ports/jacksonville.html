        <h1>Jacksonville: Florida's First Coast Gateway to the Bahamas</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Jacksonville sprawls across more land than any other city in the contiguous United States, and its port sits where the broad St. Johns River meets the Atlantic — a maritime crossroads that's been welcoming sailors since the French established Fort Caroline here in 1564. Today's cruise ships navigate the same waters once plied by Spanish galleons, Confederate blockade runners, and early 20th-century steamships that made Jacksonville a winter escape for wealthy Northerners.</p>

          <p>What Jacksonville lacks in cruise traffic compared to Miami or Port Canaveral, it makes up for in convenience and value. The JAXPORT cruise terminal is manageable, uncrowded, and surrounded by affordable parking and hotels. For cruisers in Georgia, the Carolinas, or northern Florida, Jacksonville offers a closer, calmer alternative to the mega-ports down the coast — with beautiful Atlantic beaches just minutes away.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>Logbook Note:</strong> I recommend arriving a day early to explore the beaches. Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach form a relaxed coastal strip that feels worlds away from Florida's tourist crowds. Grab fish tacos at a beachfront bar, watch the sunrise over the Atlantic, and start your cruise already on island time.

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
          <p>Jacksonville's history predates Plymouth Rock by more than half a century. In 1564, French Huguenots established Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River — one of the first European settlements in what would become the United States. The Spanish soon drove them out, and the region passed through French, Spanish, British, and finally American hands. The city was named for Andrew Jackson in 1822, and its strategic position on Florida's "First Coast" made it a center of commerce, shipping, and eventually tourism.</p>
          <p>The Great Fire of 1901 destroyed much of downtown — 146 city blocks and 10,000 residents left homeless in just 8 hours. But Jacksonville rebuilt with the grand brick and stone buildings that still anchor the riverfront. In the early 20th century, the city was a film production center rivaling Hollywood, and its beaches drew winter visitors seeking warm weather and healing waters. Today's cruisers sail past the same shores where Timucuan peoples fished for millennia, where Spanish missions once stood, and where the broad St. Johns River has welcomed vessels for five centuries.</p>

          <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Subtropical climate — hot and humid summers, mild winters; hurricane season runs June–November</li>
            <li><strong>Beach Driving:</strong> Some Duval County beaches allow vehicle access with a permit — a unique Florida experience</li>
            <li><strong>St. Augustine:</strong> If you have a full day, the 40-minute drive to America's oldest city is absolutely worth it</li>
            <li><strong>Seafood:</strong> Mayport shrimp are legendary — look for "Mayport shrimp" on local menus for the freshest catch</li>
            <li><strong>Port Location:</strong> The cruise terminal is in a somewhat industrial area — plan to stay at the beaches or downtown for pre-cruise exploration</li>
