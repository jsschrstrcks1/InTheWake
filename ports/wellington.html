        <h1>Wellington: New Zealand's Compact Creative Capital</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>They call it "Windy Wellington" for good reason. The moment I stepped off the shuttle into the waterfront, a gust nearly claimed my hat. But the locals seemed unbothered — jackets zipped, coffee cups clutched, striding purposefully through streets that pack more personality per square meter than any capital I've visited. This is one of the windiest cities in the world, and there's a reason: Cook Strait, the narrow channel between New Zealand's two main islands, acts as a natural wind tunnel, funneling fierce southerly gusts directly at the city.</p>

          <p>Wellington sits at the bottom of New Zealand's North Island, the world's southernmost capital city, squeezed between harbour and hills in a way that forces everything close together. The result is a city you can actually walk — from world-class museum to craft brewery to hillside viewpoint, all within an afternoon. And what a museum: Te Papa Tongarewa, which opened in 1998 on reclaimed waterfront land, spans 36,000 square meters and houses over two million items including treasures that define New Zealand's identity. The museum's bicultural philosophy — its very name means "our treasure box" in Māori — shapes every exhibition.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing before a carved Māori meeting house inside Te Papa, surrounded by taonga (treasures) that have witnessed centuries of New Zealand history. This isn't a collection of artifacts behind glass — it's a living repository where culture breathes. Then I turned a corner and came face-to-face with the colossal squid — the largest specimen ever captured, hauled up from Antarctic waters in 2007. At 495 kilograms, suspended in its preservation tank, it's both beautiful and utterly alien. And admission to see all of this is free.
          </div>

          <p>The path from Te Papa led me to Cuba Street, the bohemian heart of the city where the famous Bucket Fountain has splashed since 1969. The street takes its name not from the Caribbean island, but from an early settler ship that arrived in 1840. Today it's a gallery of independent boutiques, vinyl shops, and coffee roasters — Wellington takes its coffee seriously, with more cafes per capita than New York. I stopped at three before lunch and regretted nothing.</p>

          <p>For views, take the Cable Car. The red carriages have been climbing from Lambton Quay to Kelburn since 1902 (rebuilt in 1979). The ride takes only five minutes but lifts you above the city's compact jumble of Victorian timber and Art Deco, depositing you at the Botanic Garden for a leisurely walk back down. On a clear day, you can see across Cook Strait to the South Island mountains.</p>

          <p>If you have time for something extraordinary, visit Zealandia — the world's first fully-fenced urban ecosanctuary, just minutes from downtown. Here, 225 hectares of native forest have been restored to their pre-human state, protected by an innovative predator-proof fence. I walked the valley trails in near-silence, broken only by birdsong you won't hear anywhere else on earth. Takahē, kākā, tūī — species that were vanishing are thriving here again. It's conservation you can witness firsthand.</p>

          <p>Even the government buildings here carry character. The Beehive — that distinctive circular structure beside Parliament — was designed by British architect Sir Basil Spence and completed in 1981. Love it or find it odd (Wellingtonians debate this), it's unmistakably Wellington: practical, bold, and utterly itself.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Te Papa Tongarewa</h4>
          <p>New Zealand's national museum — 36,000 square meters of Māori culture, natural history, and art, opened in 1998. The bicultural approach is woven throughout, from the name ("our treasure box" in Māori) to the presentation. Don't miss the colossal squid — the largest ever captured at 495 kilograms, hauled from Antarctic waters in 2007. Free general admission. Allow 2-3 hours minimum. Five-minute walk from the waterfront shuttle stop.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Wellington Cable Car</h4>
          <p>Iconic red funicular from Lambton Quay to Kelburn, running since 1902 (rebuilt 1979). NZ$5-10 each way. Great views over the city and harbour. Walk down through the Botanic Garden afterward.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Cuba Street</h4>
          <p>The city's bohemian heart — named after the settler ship "Cuba" (1840), not the country. Independent shops, cafes, street art, and the famous Bucket Fountain (splashing since 1969). ideal for wandering. Accessible on foot from the waterfront.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Zealandia Ecosanctuary</h4>
          <p>World's first fully-fenced urban ecosanctuary — 225 hectares of regenerated native forest protecting rare and endangered native birds including takahē, kākā, and tūī. Predator-proof fence enables species recovery you can witness. About 10 minutes from downtown by taxi or bus. Allow 2-3 hours for trails. Entry fee applies.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Weta Workshop Tour</h4>
          <p>Visit the special effects studio behind Lord of the Rings and Avatar. Located in Miramar (15-20 min from downtown). Book in advance — popular with cruise passengers.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Wellington Botanic Garden</h4>
          <p>25 hectares of native bush and formal gardens. Free entry. Take the Cable Car up and walk down through the garden. Allow 1-2 hours for a leisurely stroll.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Parliament & The Beehive</h4>
          <p>New Zealand's Parliament complex features the distinctive Beehive — the circular executive wing designed by British architect Sir Basil Spence and completed in 1981. Free guided tours available (check schedule). Walking distance from the waterfront. Architecture buffs will appreciate the contrast between the Beehive, Gothic Revival Parliament House, and neoclassical Parliament Library.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Craft Beer Trail</h4>
          <p>Wellington claims to be New Zealand's craft beer capital. Garage Project, Panhead, and Fork & Brewer are walking distance from the waterfront. Many offer tastings.</p>
