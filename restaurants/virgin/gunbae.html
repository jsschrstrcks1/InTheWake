      <h3>Gunbae Review: Korean BBQ That Gets the Party Started</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Gunbae ("cheers" in Korean) is Virgin Voyages' Korean BBQ restaurant — and it's one of the most unique dining concepts at sea. Each table has a built-in flameless grill where you cook marinated meats and seafood yourself, sharing family-style with your table. It's included in the fare (no cover charge), social by design, and leans heavily into the communal drinking-and-eating culture of Korean BBQ. If you arrive without an appetite, you're doing it wrong.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The galbi (marinated short ribs) is the star of the grill — sweet-savory, caramelized at the edges, and worth fighting your tablemates for the last piece. The bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated beef) is tender and flavorful. The shrimp and chicken options are solid but less memorable — go for the beef. The banchan (small side dishes) keep arriving: kimchi, pickled radish, Korean slaw, and rice that soaks up the grill juices beautifully. Kimchi fried rice cooked directly on the grill at the end of the meal is a beloved ritual. The soju cocktails and Korean beer flow freely, fitting the party atmosphere. Honest assessment: the quality of your experience depends partly on your grilling skills and partly on who you're seated with. The communal tables (6–8 people) mean you may be dining with strangers, and an enthusiastic table makes the night while a quiet one can feel awkward. Some guests find the DIY format less relaxing than being served — you're cooking your own dinner, after all.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Staff demonstrate the grilling technique and keep the banchan flowing. They're enthusiastic, often leading toasts and encouraging the "gunbae!" tradition. The energy is infectious. Drink service is fast and attentive — the soju keeps coming. Dietary accommodations are handled well, with seafood and vegetable options available for the grill.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The room is designed for energy — communal seating, smoke rising from grills, K-pop-inspired décor, and a noise level that says "party." This is the loudest restaurant on the ship, and that's intentional. It's social, interactive, and completely unlike any other cruise dining experience. Couples seeking a quiet dinner should look elsewhere (try Extra Virgin or The Wake). Groups, friends traveling together, and anyone who enjoys a lively meal will love it.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Gunbae is one of Virgin Voyages' most memorable dining experiences — the galbi is excellent, the communal energy is infectious, and the kimchi fried rice finale is a highlight. It doesn't reach a perfect score because the communal seating means your experience depends on your tablemates, the DIY format isn't everyone's idea of a relaxing dinner, and the non-beef proteins are forgettable. But for a fun, social, and genuinely different meal at sea, Gunbae delivers. <em>Tip:</em> go hungry, bring friends, order the galbi, and embrace the soju toasts.</p>
