      <h3>We Fancy Review: The Dress-Up Night That Replaces Formal Night</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> We Fancy is Virgin Voyages' glamour-themed evening event — their cheeky replacement for the traditional cruise formal night. Instead of stuffy dress codes and captain's dinners, We Fancy invites guests to dress as "the fanciest version of yourself" — which can mean a ball gown, a sequined blazer, vintage glam, or creative self-expression in any form. The event features global beats, a DJ-driven dance party, a "WOW moment" (a surprise performance or spectacle), and an overall atmosphere of celebration. Held in The Manor on select evenings. No cover; drinks are Bar Tab or per-drink.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>Champagne is the drink of choice at We Fancy, and it flows readily — the bars stock extra for the evening and servers circulate with trays of sparkling wine during key moments. The champagne toast during the WOW moment is a highlight. Beyond champagne, the full cocktail menu is available. The French 75 and the espresso martini are popular choices that pair well with the dressed-up atmosphere. Where it falls short: the same Manor bar crush applies — long lines during peak hours (10:30-11:30 PM). The champagne quality is standard sparkling wine rather than genuine champagne (despite the fancy framing). The cocktails are not elevated for the occasion — the same drinks you get every other night, just in fancier clothes.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>The entertainment team curates the evening's progression expertly — building from a sophisticated early-evening vibe through the WOW moment to a full dance party. The DJs lean into global beats and contemporary pop, which matches the international crowd well. The WOW moment varies by sailing but typically involves an impressive spectacle — aerial performers, fire elements, or a synchronized performance that stops the room. The energy management across the evening is skilled. Bar service is stretched thin but the entertainment service is polished.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>We Fancy succeeds because it captures the spirit of dressing up without the stuffiness of a traditional formal night. The crowd rises to the occasion — guests put genuine effort into their outfits, and the result is a room full of adults who look and feel fabulous. The self-expression element (wear what makes you feel fancy, not what tradition demands) creates more diverse and interesting fashion than any formal night on any other cruise line. The WOW moment gives the evening a centerpiece that formal nights typically lack. Where it falls short: the concept is looser than Scarlet Night (which has a clear visual identity — wear red). "Fancy" is subjective, and some guests interpret it as regular evening wear, which dilutes the impact. The event can feel less distinctive than other themed nights. The WOW moment varies in quality — some are spectacular, others are anticlimactic.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.9/5.</strong> We Fancy is a smart, modern reimagining of the cruise formal night — it captures the joy of dressing up without the rigid traditions, and the WOW moment provides a memorable centerpiece. The crowd's fashion creativity and the celebratory energy make it one of the most photographed evenings of the voyage. It falls short on bar service (overwhelmed), cocktail elevation (same drinks, fancier clothes), and WOW moment consistency. <em>Tip:</em> pack your most creative glamorous outfit — not just a suit or cocktail dress, but something that expresses your personal fancy. The more creative the fashion, the more fun the evening. And position yourself with a clear sightline to the stage area before the WOW moment.</p>
