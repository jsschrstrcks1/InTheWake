But she was the first ship purpose-built for [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html), and she established the design philosophy that would define the company: modern, Scandinavian-inspired interiors, floor-to-ceiling windows, outdoor decks designed for sunshine and ocean views.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Entered service: November 7, 1970\n- Gross tonnage: 18,416 GT (originally 18,000 GT; stretched in 1978)\n- Capacity: 724 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Length: 534 feet (originally); stretched to 690 feet in 1978\n- Built by: W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 shipyard, Finland\n- Primary routes: Seven-night Caribbean loops from Miami\n- Signature feature: Viking Crown Lounge\u2014a glass observation lounge perched above the ship's funnel\n- Retired: 1996 (sold, became Sun Viking, later scrapped 2004)\n\n**What made Song of Norway significant:**\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge became Royal Caribbean's signature. Every major ship in the fleet would feature some version of it\u2014a high observation lounge with panoramic views. It's still there on modern ships, evolved but recognizable.\n\nShe proved the Scandinavian-modern design aesthetic worked for Caribbean cruising: light woods, clean lines, large windows, outdoor spaces that prioritized sun and sea. This wasn't ornate British ocean liner design\u2014it was something new.\n\nSong of Norway's success led directly to [Song of America](/ships/rcl/song-of-america.html) (1982) and Nordic Prince, establishing Royal Caribbean as a legitimate competitor in Caribbean cruising.",

Not stuffy like the old ocean liners.\"\n\n\"The Viking Crown Lounge at night\u2014drinks, live music, 360-degree views. You felt like you were floating above the ocean.\"\n\n\"Seven nights, affordable, reliable. She wasn't fancy, but she delivered exactly what she promised.\"\n\n\"First Caribbean cruise for thousands of Midwestern families. She made cruising accessible.\"\n\n**Industry impact:**\n\nSong of Norway established the seven-night Caribbean cruise as the industry standard. Before her, Caribbean cruising was more experimental. Song of Norway proved the route, the itinerary, and the ship design could sustain a profitable business.\n\nHer 1978 stretching (cutting the ship in half and inserting a 85-foot mid-section) pioneered the practice of ship lengthening\u2014something Royal Caribbean and other lines would do repeatedly in the 1980s and 1990s to extend ship lifespans and add capacity.\n\nBy the time she was sold in 1996, Song of Norway had introduced hundreds of thousands of passengers to Caribbean cruising. Many went on to sail newer, larger ships\u2014but they started with Song of Norway.\n\n**The Viking Crown Lounge legacy:**\n\nEvery [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) ship from 1970 through the mid-2000s featured some version of the Viking Crown Lounge. [Voyager class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) moved away from the external structure, but the concept\u2014high observation lounge with panoramic views\u2014remains central to Royal Caribbean design philosophy.\n\nSong of Norway died so that [Voyager](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), and [Icon](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) could live.",

      "markdown": "**We honeymooned on Song of Norway in 1985.**\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise. We'd saved for two years, and when we finally booked that seven-night Caribbean itinerary out of Miami, we had no idea what to expect.\n\n**What I remember most:**\n\nThe dining room felt impossibly elegant to us. White tablecloths, assigned seating, waiters who remembered our names by the second night. We were 23 years old and felt like we'd stumbled into something meant for wealthier, more sophisticated people.\n\nThe ports—Nassau, San Juan, St. Thomas—were our first taste of the Caribbean. We bought matching t-shirts in Nassau. We still have them.\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge became our spot. Every night after dinner, we'd go up there, order drinks we could barely afford, and watch the stars over the ocean. The band played \"Moon River\" one night and my wife cried.\n\n**What Song of Norway taught us:**\n\nCruising wasn't just for the wealthy. It was for regular people who wanted to celebrate something—an anniversary, a honeymoon, a big birthday. Song of Norway made us feel special without being pretentious about it.\n\nWe went on to cruise twelve more times over the next thirty years—[Vision of the Seas](/ships/rcl/vision-of-the-seas.html), [Voyager of the Seas](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html), even [Oasis of the Seas](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html). But Song of Norway was the one that started it all.\n\nShe's gone now, scrapped in 2004. But that honeymoon—the ocean, the stars, the Viking Crown Lounge—that's still with us.",

      "markdown": "**My parents took me on Song of Norway in 1979. I was eleven.**\n\nWe drove from Indianapolis to Miami—a two-day road trip in our station wagon—because flying was too expensive for a family of five. Dad had gotten a bonus at work, and Mom convinced him a cruise would be the trip of a lifetime.\n\nShe was right.\n\n**What I remember:**\n\nThe ship felt massive to an eleven-year-old. The pool deck seemed endless. The buffet—unlimited ice cream!—was beyond anything I'd experienced.\n\nThe Viking Crown Lounge was off-limits to kids at night, but during the day we could go up there. I remember looking down at the ocean from what felt like the top of the world.\n\nMy sisters and I made friends with other kids on the ship. We ran around like we owned the place. The crew didn't seem to mind—they smiled and let us explore.\n\n**The tradition:**\n\nThat trip started something. My parents cruised twice more before Dad passed. When I got married, I took my wife on [Grandeur of the Seas](/ships/rcl/grandeur-of-the-seas.html). When our kids were old enough, we booked [Freedom of the Seas](/ships/rcl/freedom-of-the-seas.html).\n\nLast year, I took my grandson on [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html). The ship is nothing like Song of Norway—it's twenty times the size, with features that would have seemed like science fiction in 1979. But the feeling is the same: family, ocean, adventure.\n\nSong of Norway started a tradition that's now four generations deep. That eleven-year-old in 1979 is now a grandfather who still gets excited when the ship pulls away from the pier.",
