      "markdown": "**Queen Mary 2 is not a cruise ship. She is an ocean liner—the last one still in scheduled transatlantic service.**\n\nThe distinction matters profoundly. Cruise ships are built for warm-weather destinations, designed to encourage passengers outdoors. Ocean liners are built to cross oceans in any weather, designed to provide sanctuary from the North Atlantic's fury.\n\nQM2's hull is reinforced to handle waves that would damage ordinary cruise ships. Her bow rises higher than any competitor's. Her draft runs deeper. She was designed not to float between Caribbean ports but to cross the Atlantic in any season, delivering passengers from Southampton to New York as Cunard has done for 185 years.\n\nWhen you book a Transatlantic Crossing on QM2, you're not taking a cruise—you're participating in maritime tradition stretching back to Britannia in 1840. No flights. No intermediate ports. Just six days of ocean, exactly as travelers experienced before commercial aviation.\n\nFor travelers who understand what ocean liners meant: Queen Mary 2 is your only opportunity to experience it. She's not nostalgic recreation. She's continuation.",

Six sea days demand self-entertainment. The realization hits around day two: you're in the middle of an ocean with nothing to do except what the ship provides.\n\nAnd QM2 provides magnificently.\n\nThe library holds 10,000 books—I read three. The Planetarium projects the same stars ancient mariners used for navigation. The lectures from Cunard Insights speakers covered everything from maritime history to astronomy. The Canyon Ranch Spa filled hours I didn't know I had.\n\nDinner became the day's anchor. Dress code mattered—two formal nights, elegant casual otherwise. The Britannia Restaurant felt like proper dining, not cruise ship feeding. Conversations developed over courses because nobody rushed to evening shows.\n\nBy day five, I understood what travelers in the 1930s knew: the crossing is the destination. The ocean becomes companion rather than obstacle. Time restructures around ship rhythms.\n\nFor travelers seeking escape: Transatlantic Crossing on QM2 delivers genuine disconnection. No ports to distract. No destinations to anticipate. Just ocean, ship, and transformation.",

Gala nights require formal wear—tuxedos or dark suits for men, gowns or cocktail dresses for women. But the formality isn't pretension. It's theater. It's transformation. It's becoming someone who dresses for dinner because dinner deserves it.\n\nI bought my first tuxedo for this cruise. Standing in front of the mirror on Gala Night One, wearing proper attire for the first time since my wedding, I felt... elevated. The man looking back wasn't someone who eats quickly and returns to screens. He was someone who dines.\n\nThe Queen's Room maintains formal atmosphere throughout the voyage. Afternoon tea arrives on proper china with proper sandwiches and proper service. Again: not stuffy, but deliberate. A choice to experience elegance that modern life rarely offers.\n\nCunard formality rewards rather than restricts. If you resist it, every dress code feels like imposition. If you embrace it, every dress code becomes permission to be your most refined self.\n\nFor first-timers nervous about Cunard expectations: bring the clothes, bring the attitude, discover that formal can feel liberating rather than constraining.",

The regulations are strict: UK-to-US sailings only (quarantine rules), advance veterinary certification, limited spaces that book months ahead.\n\nWinston's kennel was more comfortable than I expected. Climate-controlled, properly sized, maintained by dedicated staff. We visited four times daily—morning, midday, afternoon, evening—plus the outdoor exercise area on deck.\n\nThe kennel staff knew Winston's name by day two. They reported his meals, his mood, his behavior between our visits. The care was genuine, not perfunctory.\n\nWatching Winston explore the deck—salt air in his fur, Atlantic spray nearby—was worth every moment of logistics. He crossed an ocean on a ship, not terrified in a cargo hold. He arrived in America calm rather than traumatized.\n\nFor pet families relocating: QM2's kennels aren't luxury pet accommodations. They're humane transport for animals who matter too much for cargo holds. The experience costs more than flights. The peace of mind is priceless.",

Her design serves purposes no cruise ship matches.**\n\nThe bow rises 75 feet from waterline to deck—necessary for North Atlantic waves that would breach lower profiles. The hull extends 23 feet deeper than typical cruise ships—providing stability in swells that would roll lesser vessels.\n\nFour diesel engines and two gas turbines generate 157,000 horsepower—enough to maintain schedule in conditions that force other ships to slow. The pod propulsion system provides maneuverability in New York Harbor that her size would otherwise prevent.\n\nIndoors, the design reflects crossing reality. Enclosed promenades allow walking regardless of weather. The Chart Room provides protected ocean viewing. Public spaces cluster toward the center where motion is minimal.\n\n[Queen Victoria](/ships/cunard/queen-victoria.html), [Queen Elizabeth](/ships/cunard/queen-elizabeth.html), and [Queen Anne](/ships/cunard/queen-anne.html) are lovely cruise ships. Queen Mary 2 is something else: a purpose-built ocean liner designed for a specific job. Every design choice reflects that purpose.\n\nFor design enthusiasts: QM2 rewards study.

Cunard's structure prevented that entirely. Assigned dining times meant I knew when and where I'd find company. The daily programme offered lectures, activities, and gatherings.

Ten thousand books and fellow readers who understood that shared silence is its own intimacy.

The Atlantic stretched in every direction, isolating us wonderfully from the world.\n\nGala nights gave us occasion to celebrate publicly. My husband in dinner jacket, me in wedding-adjacent gown, we felt like film stars from another era. Fellow passengers bought us champagne, offered toasts, shared stories of their own decades-long marriages. The celebration extended beyond our suite.\n\nSix sea days meant six days focused entirely on each other. No sightseeing obligations. No activity schedules. We could talk for hours without interruption, learning each other as we'd never had time to before. The ocean imposed stillness.\n\nThe Commodore Club became our evening ritual. Cocktails as the sun set into endless sea, planning the marriage we were beginning.

The rhythm feels right.\n\nMy fellow passengers share my sensibilities. The crossing attracts people who value the journey, who understand that rushing defeats the purpose. Dinner conversations involve substance—history, culture, the mechanics of ocean travel. The demographic skews mature, creating community of peers.\n\nPhysical considerations are handled gracefully.

This was voyage.\n\nThe first day at sea overwhelmed me. No ports to anticipate, no excursions to plan—just ship and ocean in every direction. I'd expected boredom. Instead, I discovered the Cunard Insights lecture series: maritime historians explaining why QM2 is the last true ocean liner, astronomers mapping the same stars ancient mariners used for navigation.

The deck's length accommodates proper walking, its enclosure permits exercise when North Atlantic conditions would make open decks impossible. These design decisions distinguish ocean liner from cruise ship, and they matter to travelers who've experienced both.\n\nBreakfast in the Queens Grill follows, where staff who've served me for years inquire about grandchildren they've watched grow through photographs and stories. The personal connection accumulates across voyages, transforming transaction into relationship.\n\nThe Cunard Insights programme still challenges intellectually. Guest speakers evolve—new historians, fresh perspectives—while maintaining the assumption that passengers came aboard to think, not merely to be entertained. I've attended lectures that sparked months of subsequent reading.\n\nThe library remains extraordinary. Ten thousand volumes, properly curated, properly cared for. I've discovered authors there who became favorites ashore.

White gloves, proper china, sandwiches without crusts. These ceremonies matter to travelers who remember what they meant.\n\nVeteran travelers sometimes fear beloved institutions will be diminished by commercial pressures.

At home, everyone worried, watched, asked questions I couldn't answer. On Queen Mary 2, the Atlantic stretched vast and unconcerned with my survival or my struggles. The insignificance felt liberating rather than diminishing.\n\nThe first days, I barely functioned.
