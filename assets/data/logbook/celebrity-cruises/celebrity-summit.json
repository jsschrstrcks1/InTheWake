Pieces of her live on Summit.**\n\n[Celebrity Summit's](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-summit.html) specialty restaurant preserves original Art Deco panels from the Normandie—the legendary French liner destroyed by fire in 1942. These aren't replicas. This is authentic maritime history.\n\nDining surrounded by genuine 1930s craftsmanship changes the meal entirely. The lacquer work. The period designs. The knowledge that you're touching the same surfaces passengers touched ninety years ago.\n\n'This is from the actual Normandie?' a fellow passenger asked.\n\n'The actual Normandie,' the server confirmed. 'What survived the fire.'\n\nThe food honors the setting. French preparations. Classic techniques. Service pacing that respects the room's heritage. You're not just eating—you're participating in preserved history.\n\nThe panels glow in candlelight. The Art Deco geometry catches angles. The room feels transported from another era—because it was.\n\n**The truth:** Summit's Normandie restaurant offers genuine ocean liner heritage. The upcharge buys authentic history, not replica atmosphere. See [our heritage dining guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Summit specifically for the Normandie experience. Nothing else in modern cruising matches it.",

[Celebrity Summit's](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-summit.html) Bermuda voyages do something different.\n\nTwo nights docked in King's Wharf. The ship becomes your hotel. Bermuda becomes your playground without luggage logistics. Evening beach trips. Sunset cocktails ashore. Morning swims before crowds.\n\n'We're staying overnight?' my wife asked, surprised.\n\n'Two nights,' I confirmed. 'Bermuda done properly.'\n\nThe pink sand deserves time. Horseshoe Bay shifts colors throughout the day. The cruise terminal location provides easy island access. Nothing rushed. Nothing abbreviated.\n\nSummit's premium service enhanced the destination. Returning to elegant space after island exploration. The contrast between beach casualness and ship sophistication.\n\n**The lesson:** Summit delivers Bermuda through overnight stays. The destination gets proper time. Premium service awaits your return. See [our Bermuda cruise guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Summit to Bermuda specifically for the overnight stays.

Her tragedy. The panels that survived her destruction.\n\n[Celebrity Summit](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-summit.html) carries those panels.\n\nI dined alone at the Normandie restaurant, surrounded by panels he'd described countless times. The Art Deco geometry he'd shown me in photographs. The history he'd taught me now tangible beneath my fingers.\n\n'This is what he wanted to see,' I whispered to no one.\n\nThe server noticed my emotion. Champagne appeared—on the house, he explained quietly. The crew understood. The ship held space for grief.\n\nMy husband couldn't see the panels, but I could see them for him. His passion became my pilgrimage. The history he'd loved now touched by my hands.\n\n**The truth:** Summit's heritage serves grief seeking connection to loved ones' passions. The Normandie panels provide tangible link to maritime history. See [In the Wake of Grief](/solo/in-the-wake-of-grief.html).\n\nI cruise Summit when I miss him. The panels he loved hold his memory.

The weather dependencies. The accessibility lost between vessel and shore.\n\n[Celebrity Summit's](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-summit.html) Bermuda voyages dock at King's Wharf—no tender required. My wheelchair rolled directly from ship to shore.\n\nThe [accessible cabin](/accessibility.html) provided my secure base. The ship's overnight stays meant multiple opportunities for shore exploration. Good weather one day, try again the next.\n\nBermuda's accessibility surprised me. Beach wheelchairs at certain locations. Accessible buses for island exploration. Infrastructure that acknowledged my existence.\n\n'You're going ashore again?' my caregiver asked on night two.\n\n'Because I can,' I explained. 'The dock makes everything possible.'\n\nThe overnight stays provided flexibility that single-day ports couldn't. I explored at my pace, returned when tired, went back refreshed.\n\n**The lesson:** Summit's Bermuda delivers accessibility through dockside mooring and overnight flexibility. No tenders, multiple chances. See [our accessible cruising guide](/accessibility.html).\n\nI cruise Summit to Bermuda specifically for the docking. The accessibility works when the ship stays put.",

I drove to Cape Liberty, parked, boarded. Solo travel began at my car door.\n\nThe ship's intimate size accelerated solo community. By day two, the Martini Bar knew my face. By day four, I had dinner companions. The 2,000-passenger scale meant constant familiar encounters.\n\n'You came alone from New Jersey?' a new friend asked.\n\n'Drove forty-five minutes,' I shrugged. 'Solo cruising shouldn't require flying.'\n\nThe convenience multiplied vacation value. Money saved on pre-cruise logistics became specialty dining. Energy saved became exploration capacity.\n\n**The truth:** Summit serves regional solo travelers through Northeast departures. The convenience eliminates pre-cruise exhaustion.

But [Celebrity Summit's](/ships/celebrity-cruises/celebrity-summit.html) Metropolitan Restaurant, the main dining room, proved equally impressive.\n\nThe two-deck design creates atmosphere that single-level restaurants can't match. The grand staircase entrance. The chandelier drama. The sense that every dinner is occasion.\n\nThe food matched the setting. Rotating menus that showed actual creativity. Wine service that demonstrated knowledge. Desserts that weren't afterthoughts.\n\n'This is the included restaurant?' my dining companion asked.\n\n'This is the included restaurant,' I confirmed. 'Summit's main dining is exceptional.'\n\nThe servers made the difference too. Remembered preferences. Anticipated needs. Service timing that never rushed, never lagged. Professional attention that specialty restaurants sometimes forgot to match.\n\n**The lesson:** Summit's Metropolitan Restaurant delivers main dining excellence. The specialty restaurants are wonderful; the included option is too. See [our dining guide](/articles.html).\n\nI eat Metropolitan every night on Summit. The main dining room earns its own praise.",

The glamour of 1930s French ocean liner design. The historical weight of surviving tragedy. The genuine heritage that reproductions can't match.\n\n'Why Summit over the others?' friends ask.\n\n'Because I prefer the Normandie era to the Olympic era,' I explain. 'Different heritage, different atmosphere.'\n\nAll four ships share the Millennium Class strengths—intimate scale, excellent service, Revolution updates. But the heritage features distinguish them. Your preference for Art Deco versus Edwardian determines your choice.\n\n**The lesson:** Summit offers Art Deco heritage within Millennium Class excellence. If the Normandie era appeals more than the Olympic era, Summit is your ship. See [our ship comparison guide](/articles.html).\n\nI cruise Summit when the Normandie calls.

Luminae restaurant had tables available. The sundeck never crowded. The premium we paid delivered premium we experienced.\n\nButler service scaled appropriately too. Fewer suites meant more attention. Requests handled faster.

We ran into each other naturally throughout the day. Family dinners didn't require complicated coordination. Three generations on 2,000-passenger scale felt manageable.\n\n'This works for everyone,' my mother observed.\n\n'That's the point,' I agreed.
