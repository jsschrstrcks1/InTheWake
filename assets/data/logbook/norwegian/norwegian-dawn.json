We had evenings. We had mornings. We had time.\n\nThe first night, we walked Hamilton after dinner. Streets empty of tourists. Locals nodding hello. A pub where we were the only cruise passengers, drinking with Bermudians who told us which beaches to visit, which restaurants to try, which roads to scooter down.\n\n'Most cruisers never see this,' a local said. 'They're back on the ship by dinner.'\n\n'We're here until morning,' I answered.\n\n'Then you'll actually see Bermuda,' she promised.\n\n**The truth:** Dawn's Bermuda overnights transform tourism into experience.
