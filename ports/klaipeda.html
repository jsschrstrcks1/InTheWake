        <h1>Klaipeda: Where the Baltic Meets the Dunes</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Klaipeda doesn't announce itself the way Mediterranean ports do. There's no technicolor postcard skyline, no ancient amphitheater commanding the harbor. This is the Baltic — quieter, more reserved, a place where history whispers rather than shouts. Lithuania's only seaport and third-largest city, Klaipeda was Memel for seven centuries, a Prussian city where German merchants built half-timbered warehouses and Hanseatic traders negotiated deals in dark taverns. The language has changed, but the cobblestones remember.</p>

          <p>The Old Town is small enough to walk in an hour, big enough to get pleasantly lost. Theater Square centers everything — a statue of Ann of Klaipeda stands watch (she's the city's symbol, based on Simon Dach's 17th-century poem), and the Drama Theater rises behind her in neoclassical dignity. Around the square, narrow streets wind past amber shops, cafes serving Lithuanian dark bread, and the Simon Dach Fountain, where bronze figures dance to the tune of "Ännchen von Tharau." It's charming in that understated Baltic way, like someone who doesn't realize how beautiful they are.</p>

            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on Parnidis Dune at sunset, 60 meters above the Curonian Lagoon. The highest shifting sand dune in Europe, and it shifts — every year the wind reshapes it, grain by grain. Behind me, the Baltic Sea rolled silver-grey. Before me, the lagoon spread calm as glass, Lithuania on one shore, Russia on the other. A sundial sculpture stood on the summit, casting its shadow. I understood why they call this place a desert between water and sky. The wind carried pine scent and salt. Time felt optional.
          </div>

          <p>But Klaipeda is really a gateway. The Curonian Spit — Kuršių Nerija — stretches 98 kilometers south, a ribbon of sand barely wider than a thought, separating the Baltic Sea from the Curonian Lagoon. UNESCO calls it a World Heritage Site. I call it otherworldly. Pine forests grow where no trees should survive. Fishing villages cling to the shore. Dunes tower like cathedrals. You take a ten-minute ferry from Klaipeda's Old Castle Port to Smiltynė, and suddenly you're walking through landscapes that belong in Saharan Africa, except it's 55 degrees north and the trees are conifers.</p>

          <p>If you have time for nothing else, take the bus to Juodkrantė and walk the Hill of Witches. It's a woodland sculpture trail — dozens of massive wooden carvings depicting Lithuanian folk tales, pagan deities, witches, devils, fishermen. Each sculpture is weathered, moss-covered, slightly unsettling in the best way. Kids love it. Adults photograph it and wonder why they don't make art like this at home.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Curonian Spit (Kuršių Nerija) UNESCO World Heritage Site</h4>
          <p>98km sand peninsula with towering dunes, pine forests, and fishing villages. Ferry from Old Castle Port to Smiltynė (10 min, every 30 min, €2).

Otherworldly, slightly eerie, utterly unique. Bus from Smiltynė ferry (30 min). Allow 1-2 hours for the trail. Bring camera — these sculptures are unforgettable.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Old Town & Theater Square</h4>
          <p>German half-timbered architecture, cobblestone streets, Theater Square with Ann of Klaipeda statue and Simon Dach Fountain. 18th-century warehouses, amber shops, cafes. Walkable from port (10-15 min). Free. Allow 1-2 hours browsing. City sculpture trail has 100+ sculptures scattered throughout — download map from tourist office.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Lithuanian Sea Museum & Aquarium</h4>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Smiltynė Beaches</h4>
          <p>Wide sandy Baltic beaches across the lagoon from Klaipeda. Clean, quiet, backed by pine forests. Ferry to Smiltynė (10 min), walk north. Free. Swimming June-August (water cool but tolerable). Beach promenade, cafes, cycling paths. Perfect half-day combining beach, Sea Museum, and nature trails. Bring windbreaker — Baltic wind is persistent.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Blacksmith's Museum & Clock Museum</h4>
          <p>Two quirky museums in Old Town. Blacksmith's Museum shows traditional ironworking with anvil demonstrations. Clock Museum has 400+ timepieces from pocket watches to tower clocks.

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cepelinai:</strong> Lithuanian national dish — potato dumplings shaped like zeppelins, stuffed with meat, served with sour cream and bacon bits. Heavy, hearty, delicious.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked Fish:</strong> Baltic herring, eel, salmon — smoked in traditional smokehouses on Curonian Spit. Sold in markets and restaurants. Authentic local flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Šaltibarščiai:</strong> Cold beet soup (pink!) with kefir, cucumbers, eggs, dill. Summer staple. Refreshing, tangy, surprisingly good.</li>
            <li><strong>Lithuanian Dark Rye Bread:</strong> Dense, slightly sweet, served with butter and honey or garlic. Every meal starts with it. Try it fresh from bakeries.</li>
            <li><strong>Kibinai:</strong> Pastries stuffed with mutton or pork — originally Karaim Jewish tradition. Savory, portable, perfect street food. Find near Theater Square.</li>
            <li><strong>Šakotis:</strong> "Tree cake" — spit cake with branch-like ridges, baked over open fire. Traditional celebration dessert. Sweet, crispy, unique.</li>

          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Start with the Curonian Spit if you have limited time — it's the main attraction and worth prioritizing. Take first ferry (7am summer) for fewer crowds.</li>
            <li>Download Klaipeda sculpture map from tourist office — city has 100+ outdoor sculptures scattered through streets. Great scavenger hunt.</li>
            <li>Weather changes quickly on the Spit — bring layers and windbreaker even in summer. Baltic wind is constant and cooling.</li>
            <li>Amber is everywhere in shops, but quality varies. Look for authentic Baltic amber with inclusions. Prices should be reasonable — don't overpay for tourist markup.</li>
            <li>Lithuanian isn't related to any language you know (Baltic language family). "Labas" (hello), "Ačiū" (thank you), "Prašom" (please) appreciated but English widely spoken.</li>
            <li>ATMs plentiful, cards widely accepted. Euros standard. No need for large cash amounts.</li>
            <li>Hill of Witches sculptures are weathered and moss-covered intentionally — they're meant to feel ancient and folkloric. Don't expect polished museum pieces.</li>
            <li>Smiltynė beaches are excellent but water is Baltic-cold (15-20°C in summer). Locals swim; decide your own tolerance. Pine forests offer beautiful walks regardless.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Author's Note</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="line-height:1.6;color:#5a4a3a;">Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake—charts drawn from research, captain's wisdom, and the accounts of fellow travelers. I write them knowing that the truest understanding comes only when you stand on the pier, smell the salt air, and trace the streets with your own feet. When my anchor finally drops here, I'll return to these pages and tell you what I found.</p>

        <!-- Weather FAQs -->
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: When is the best time to visit Klaipeda?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">May through September offers the best weather for visiting the Curonian Spit and exploring Old Town. June-August brings warm temperatures (65-70°F) and long daylight hours, while May and September offer fewer crowds with pleasant conditions.</p></details>
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: What should I pack for Klaipeda weather?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Pack layers and a windbreaker—Baltic wind is constant and strong, especially on the Curonian Spit. Even in summer, bring long sleeves and a jacket. Comfortable walking shoes, sunscreen, and a light rain jacket are essential. The wind makes it feel cooler than the actual temperature.</p></details>
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Is there a hurricane or storm season in Klaipeda?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Klaipeda doesn't experience hurricanes. The Baltic Sea can see autumn storms (September-November) with strong winds and rain, but these are typically brief weather systems. Winter brings cold winds but not tropical-style storms.</p></details>
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Will rain ruin my visit to Klaipeda?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Rain is common throughout the year but rarely ruins a visit. Old Town has covered arcades and museums (Clock Museum, Blacksmith's Museum), and indoor attractions offer good alternatives. Pack a light rain jacket and embrace the Baltic atmosphere—the Curonian Spit can be hauntingly beautiful in mist and drizzle.</p></details>
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: Is the water warm enough for swimming in Klaipeda?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Baltic Sea water stays cold year-round, reaching only 15-20°C (59-68°F) even in August. Locals swim in summer, but many visitors find it too cold. The beaches at Smiltynė are beautiful for walking and the pine forest trails are excellent regardless of swimming.</p></details>
        <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;"><summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Q: How windy does it get on the Curonian Spit?</summary><p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">The Curonian Spit experiences strong, constant Baltic winds year-round. Windbreaker or windproof jacket is essential—the wind chill can make temperatures feel 5-10°F colder than actual. This is normal weather for the region and part of what shapes the dramatic sand dunes.</p></details>
