    <article class="card"><h1>Halifax: My Maritime Marvel</h1>
      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>We docked right downtown and walked the entire harbor boardwalk before 9 a.m. — past fishing boats, bagpipers, and people commuting on scooters like it was normal. The air smelled like salt and donuts (Tim Hortons is religion here). Halifax has been a harbor city since 1749, when the British founded it and named it after the Earl of Halifax. That heritage runs deep here — you feel it in the cobblestones and the way locals still talk about "the explosion" like it happened yesterday.</p>
      <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
        <img src="img/halifax/halifax-1.webp" alt="Halifax harbor view" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Halifax — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Halifax&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiMedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>

        <p>First stop: Citadel Hill. The star-shaped British fort has commanded this harbor since 1856. The noon gun still fires every day — we timed it perfectly and the boom rattled our ribcages. The young guides in period uniforms are hilarious and actually know their stuff.</p>

        <p>Then down to the Maritime Museum — the Titanic exhibit is sobering. Halifax sent recovery ships after the sinking, and 121 victims are buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery. The museum has the only surviving deck chair, a pair of millionaire's gloves, and little child's shoes that make you tear up. But the most haunting exhibit is the Halifax Explosion: December 6, 1917, two ships collided in the harbor and 1,800 people were killed. Half the city was leveled. The museum does an incredible job telling both tragedies with dignity.</p>

        <p>Lunch was the famous Halifax donair at King of Donair — spiced meat, sweet garlic sauce, tomatoes, onions wrapped in pita. Messy, glorious, and better than any late-night kebab I've ever had. Afternoon was a lazy wander through the Public Gardens (peak Victorian charm) and a pint at Alexander Keith's brewery tour — the "historical characters" are actors who sing sea shanties and pour you beer like it's 1863.</p>
      <figure class="logbook-image float-left">

      </figure>

        <p>I also walked through Pier 21, Canada's Ellis Island. From 1928 to 1971, over a million immigrants passed through these halls. The exhibits are moving — you can search databases for family names and see the actual processing rooms where people started their new lives. It's walkable from the cruise terminal.</p>

        <p>The pros: super walkable, genuinely friendly people, and great seafood.</p>
        <p>The cons: weather can turn in ten minutes — we went from sun to sideways rain in one afternoon.</p>

        <p>Practical tips: The boardwalk is 3 km end-to-end — perfect for stretching sea legs. Brewery tour books up — reserve online if possible.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Sitting on the waterfront at dusk with fish & chips wrapped in newspaper, watching the Theodore Tugboat puttering around the harbor while a busker played "Barrett's Privateers" and the whole crowd sang along.

        <h3>Top Excursions from Halifax</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peggy's Cove (half-day):</strong> Canada's most photographed lighthouse (built 1868), 45 km / 50 minutes from port. Local legend says it's named after an orphaned girl named "Peggy of the Cove," the sole survivor of a shipwreck. The keeper's cottage is a working post office — mail a postcard with the famous lighthouse stamp. Don't miss the de Garthe Monument, a 100-foot relief carved directly into granite depicting 32 fishermen and their families. Go early or late to avoid midday cruise crowds. The granite "barrens" are slippery when wet — heed the warning signs.</li>
          <li><strong>Fairview Lawn Cemetery:</strong> Final resting place of 121 Titanic victims, including the "unknown child" whose identity was confirmed by DNA in 2007. Graves arranged in the shape of a ship's hull. Free to visit, 4 km from downtown.</li>
          <li><strong>Maritime Museum of the Atlantic:</strong> Titanic exhibit with the only surviving deck chair and heartbreaking artifacts. Also covers the 1917 Halifax Explosion that leveled half the city. Walkable from pier.</li>
          <li><strong>Alexander Keith's Brewery Tour:</strong> Actors in period costume guide you through 1820s brewing history with ale tastings and sea shanty singalongs. Book ahead — popular.</li>
          <li><strong>Citadel Hill:</strong> Star-shaped fortress with daily noon gun firing. Arrive 15 minutes early for a good spot. Kilted Highland regiment guides patrol the grounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Pier 21 National Historic Site:</strong> Canada's version of Ellis Island. From 1928-1971, over one million immigrants arrived through these halls. Interactive exhibits, searchable databases, and the actual processing rooms. Walkable from cruise terminal. Free admission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Around Halifax</h3>
        <p>Halifax is exceptionally walkable — the waterfront boardwalk stretches 4 km from Seaport to Casino, all flat and accessible. Bagpipers often greet arriving cruise ships at the pier. For Peggy's Cove, book a ship tour (~$60-80) or shared van. Halifax Transit ferry to Dartmouth costs $2.75 and offers great harbor views. Uber and Lyft both operate in Halifax.</p>

        <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Atlantic weather laughs at forecasts — pack layers and a rain jacket even on sunny days.</li>
          <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Canadian dollars; US dollars sometimes accepted but at poor rates. ATMs at the terminal.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> 15-20% at restaurants, same as the US.</li>
          <li><strong>Try the donair:</strong> Halifax invented this late-night delicacy — spiced meat, sweet garlic sauce, in pita. Not pretty, but delicious.</li>
          <li><strong>Free WiFi:</strong> Available at the terminal and most waterfront establishments.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake.</strong> This guide draws from published accounts, fellow cruisers, and careful research — but it does not yet carry the weight of my own anchor.

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Halifax is friendly, walkable, and has the best waterfront boardwalk in Atlantic Canada. Citadel Hill, Alexander Keith's brewery, and the moving Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum make it a perfect port day.
