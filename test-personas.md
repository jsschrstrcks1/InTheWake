### Persona 25: The Brennans (Kid-Hating Parents) - Edge Case

**Answers**: family_young, a_few, balanced, low, ship, standard, balanced, family

**Analysis Challenge:**
- family_young + low crowd_tolerance is an unusual combination
- Quiz should still recommend family ships (they have kids!)
- But the low crowd tolerance will penalize mega-ships

**RCL Scores:**
- icon: family_young(18) + low(-14) + ship(12) + family_bonus(14) = **30** (penalized for crowds)
- radiance: family_young(0) + low(14) + ship(0) = **14** (no kids club!)

**Carnival Scores:**
- excel: family_young(16) + low(-14) + ship(14) + family_bonus(14) = **30**
- vista: family_young(14) + low(-10) + ship(10) + family_bonus(14) = **28**
- spirit: low(14) + family_young(-12) = **2** (correctly penalized for no kids facilities)

**RCL Scores:**
- radiance: solo(10) + relax(18) + low(14) + ports(18) + value(6) = **66**
- vision: solo(10) + relax(14) + low(12) + ports(18) + value(10) + short(0) = **64**

**Holland America Scores:**
- vista: solo(10) + relax(16) + low(14) + ports(14) + value(12) = **66**

**NCL Scores:**
- sun: solo(6) + relax(16) + low(14) + ports(10) + value(14) + short(12) = **72**
- spirit: relax(14) + low(14) + ports(12) + value(12) = **52**

**Expected Result:** NCL Sun, RCL Radiance, Holland America Vista - small, quiet, port-focused
**Verdict:** Quiz produces reasonable result even for negative persona!

---

## Key Edge Cases Identified

### 1. Family + Low Crowd Tolerance (Persona 25)
- **Issue:** Rare combination that creates tension in scoring
- **Behavior:** Quiz produces compromise results (mid-size family ships)
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding advisory text for this combination

### 2. Budget + Luxury Expectations (Persona 23)
- **Issue:** Value budget + dining focus + low crowds
- **Behavior:** Quiz will recommend premium mainstream (Celebrity, Princess) not true luxury
- **Recommendation:** Results match budget, not expectations - this is correct

### 3. "Balanced" Heavy Profiles (Personas 21, 22)
- **Issue:** Multiple "balanced" answers reduce differentiation
- **Behavior:** Quiz defaults to versatile ships (Freedom, Quantum class)
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable fallback behavior

### 4. Adults-Only Warning for Families
- **Behavior:** Virgin Voyages scores strongly negative (-30) for family_young/family_teens/multigen
- **Result:** Correctly excluded from family results with warning
- **Verdict:** WORKING AS INTENDED

### 5. Solo Traveler Scoring
- **Behavior:** NCL Epic and Prima get strong solo bonuses (+16-18)
- **Virgin Lady gets +22 for solo
- **Result:** Solo-friendly options correctly surfaced
- **Verdict:** WORKING WELL

## Recommendations for Quiz Improvements

Based on persona analysis:

### High Priority - Must_Have Question Additions

1. **Nightlife/Bars** - Jake's Crew cares about bars and party scene, not waterslides. Current must_have options miss this entirely.
   - Add: `nightlife` option ("Bars, clubs, casino, party scene")
   - Benefits: Bachelor parties, girls' trips, young friend groups
   - Scoring: Virgin +20, Carnival Excel +15, NCL Breakaway+ +12

2. **Spa/Wellness** - Priya's actual priority is spa, not "scenic"
   - Add: `spa` option ("Spa, wellness, relaxation")
   - Benefits: Solo wellness travelers, couples retreats
   - Scoring: Celebrity +15, Oceania +14, Seabourn +14, Virgin +12

3. **Service Level** - Victoria & James need butler-level service distinction
   - Add: `service` option ("White-glove, butler-level service")
   - Benefits: Ultra-luxury seekers who won't compromise on service
   - Scoring: Regent +20, Silversea +20, Seabourn +18, Explora +16
   - Negative: Mainstream lines -10 (correctly excludes them)

### High Priority - New Question: Kid Separation

**Proposed Question:** "How important is separation from children?"

Options:
- `not_applicable` - "Traveling with kids / doesn't matter"
- `adult_spaces` - "Want good adult-only areas"
- `kids_away` - "Need excellent kids club so parents get adult time"
- `no_kids_period` - "Prefer adults-only environment entirely"

Scoring impact:
- `adult_spaces`: RCL Solarium ships +8, Celebrity +10, NCL Haven +8
- `kids_away`: Icon/Oasis +15 (best kids programs = most separation), Carnival Vista +12
- `no_kids_period`: Virgin +25, luxury lines +10, mainstream family ships -15

This solves:
- Brennans (want kids occupied elsewhere)
- Jen's 40th (want no kids at all)
- Priya (wants adult atmosphere)
- Jake's Crew (bachelor party, no kids)

### High Priority - Conditional Follow-Up: Accessibility

**Trigger:** After main quiz, if user indicates interest:
"Do you have any accessibility needs we should consider?"

Options:
- `none` - "No accessibility needs"
- `mobility_mild` - "Some mobility limitations (cane, limited walking)"
- `mobility_wheelchair` - "Wheelchair or scooter user"
- `sensory_visual` - "Visual impairment"
- `sensory_auditory` - "Hearing impairment"
- `cognitive` - "Autism/sensory processing / cognitive needs"

Scoring impact:
- `mobility_mild`: Penalize ships where main activities require climbing/stairs
- `mobility_wheelchair`: Boost newer ships with better accessibility, penalize older/smaller
- `cognitive`: Boost RCL (Autism on the Seas), Carnival (sensory-friendly), Royal Caribbean

This solves:
- Bob & Carol (mobility limitations)
- Garcia Family (autism)

### Medium Priority - Budget/Luxury Mismatch Advisory

When quiz detects:
- `budget_mindset: value` AND (`crowd_tolerance: low` OR `must_have: dining` OR `must_have: service`)

Display advisory on results page:
> "Your preferences suggest premium/luxury experiences, but you've selected a value budget. Consider:
> - **Suites on mainstream lines** for 'luxury lite' experience
> - **Repositioning cruises** on luxury lines at 40-60% discount
> - **Last-minute deals** through cruise line newsletters
> - Or adjust expectations - Celebrity/Holland America offer premium feel at mid-range prices"

This helps The Nguyens understand the tradeoff rather than being silently disappointed.

### Medium Priority - Special Needs Family Indicator

For families who select accessibility needs, provide results guidance:
- RCL: Autism on the Seas partnership, sensory-friendly films, trained staff
- Carnival: Sensory-friendly screenings, quiet spaces
- Princess: Good accessibility reputation
- NCL: Splash Academy trained staff

### Low Priority - Research Needed First

**Vegan/Dietary Dealbreaker:**
- Research needed: Do MSC, Costa, Explora adequately serve vegans?
- If all 15 lines accommodate, skip this (universal capability)
- If some struggle, add to must_have: `dietary` ("Vegan, gluten-free, allergy-safe")

**WiFi Quality:**
- No industry-wide metric exists
- Skip for now - too hard to score consistently
- Alex (digital nomad) will need to research this independently

### Not Needed - Out of Scope

**Itinerary preferences (sea days vs port-intensive):**
- Quiz recommends SHIPS, not itineraries
- Eleanor will select her own port-intensive itinerary at booking
- Port-focused ship classes already scored via `ship_vs_ports: ports`

## Persona 28: Michael - Expanded Backstory

**Why Michael hates cruises:**
- **Practical engineer mindset** - Sees captive-audience pricing as "tourist trap"
- **Values autonomy** - Can't leave when he wants, feels trapped
- **Introvert** - Forced socialization (assigned dining, deck parties) is nightmare
- **Frugal** - Paying for things he won't use (shows, pools, kids activities)
- **Claustrophobic tendencies** - Small cabin, can't escape ship
- **Skeptic** - Assumes everything is designed to extract money from him

**Why escape options matter:**
- Balcony = private outdoor space, can avoid public areas
- Library/quiet lounges = hide from "cruise activities"
- Room service = avoid MDR assigned seating
- Port days = OFF the ship, exploring independently

**What might convert him:**
- Ship with excellent balcony/suite with space to retreat
- Destination-intensive itinerary (more time OFF ship)
- Specialty dining where HE chooses when/where
- Line with less "forced fun" (Celebrity, Holland America vs Carnival)

**Quiz can't capture this, but results could note:**
> "For reluctant cruisers or those who value autonomy, consider: longer balcony time, destination-focused itineraries, premium lines with flexible dining."
