# In The Wake Root Standards (Sub-Document v2.233)

This sub-document defines rules for root pages (e.g., /index.html, /packing-lists.html, /ships/ships.html). It is part of the modular "In The Wake Standards v2.233" and must be used with the [Main Standards](/standards/main-standards.md) for global rules (e.g., absolute URLs, versioning).

## 8) Packing Page (Special Rules)
- Divided into sections: Carry-On, Men, Women, Everyone, Families, Tips.
- Includes secondary sticky pill nav anchored to each section with stable `id` anchors.
- Cards are collapsible using `<details><summary>` elements.
- Tips section remains detailed, not overly reduced.
- Affiliate disclosure appears in the footer as a polished banner.

## Root Page Structure
- **Scope**: All root pages (e.g., /index.html, /restaurants.html).
- Follow Grandeurâ€™s meta/hero structure (e.g., Welcome card on /index.html).
- Apply global rules (e.g., absolute URLs, accessibility) from main standards.
