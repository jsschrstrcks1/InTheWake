      <h2>My Jamaica Logbook</h2>

      <p>Sailing into Falmouth's historic Georgian port feels like stepping back in time — the architecture dates to the 1790s when this was the busiest port in Jamaica. But I'm not here for the buildings. I'm here for the waterfalls, the jerk, and the reggae that pulses through everything on this island. Jamaica doesn't just welcome you; it embraces you with open arms and "one love" on every lip.</p>

      <p>My perfect Jamaica day starts early, straight off the ship and into a private driver's van. For groups of 4-6, a private driver for the whole day runs surprisingly affordable (around $150-180 total, split among everyone), and the freedom is worth every penny. First stop: Dunn's River Falls. You've seen the photos — 600 feet of cascading terraces you literally climb, hand-in-hand with fellow adventurers forming a human chain. Water shoes are essential (rent them there), and yes, you will get soaked. That's the point.</p>

      <p>But here's my secret: skip the midday crowds. Either go first thing (8:30 AM) or wait until 3 PM when the tour buses have left. The climb itself is magical — cold mountain water rushing past, guides helping you navigate the slippery rocks, the roar of the falls drowning out everything but laughter.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Jumping off the 20-foot rock at Blue Hole into that impossible electric-blue water while everyone on the rocks above cheered. For three seconds of free fall, I felt like a superhero. Landing in that cold, mineral-rich water and surfacing to reggae music playing from someone's speaker — that's Jamaica in a single moment.
      </div>

      <p>Blue Hole is my favorite, honestly. Way less crowded than Dunn's River, more adventurous (cliff jumping from 5 to 25 feet, depending on your courage), and there's a Tarzan swing that launches you into the deepest pool. The local guides are characters — encouraging you, giving you ridiculous nicknames, making the whole thing feel like an adventure with friends rather than a tourist activity.</p>

      <p>Then Scotchies. Oh, Scotchies. There are locations in both Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, and either one will ruin you for any other jerk chicken you ever eat. The meat is slow-smoked over pimento wood in outdoor pits, the spice level is serious but balanced, and the festival (fried dumplings) are the perfect sweet counterpoint. Pair it with a Red Stripe or a homemade ginger beer, and you'll understand why this hole-in-the-wall joint is famous worldwide.</p>

      <p>If you have time after food coma recovery, river tubing on the White River is pure relaxation — floating down gentle rapids with a drink in hand while palm trees shade the banks. Or hit Doctor's Cave Beach in Montego Bay, the most famous stretch of sand in Jamaica with clear, calm water perfect for that post-adventure soak.</p>

    <!-- Three Cruise Ports Section -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Jamaica's Three Cruise Ports</h3>
      <p>Jamaica welcomes cruise ships at three distinct locations along the north coast, each offering different advantages for visitors:</p>

      <h4>Ocho Rios ("Ochi")</h4>
      <p>This bustling port handles the highest volume of cruise traffic throughout the year. The town center sits within comfortable walking distance of the pier, making it easy to explore shops, restaurants, and local markets on your own. Most visitors use Ocho Rios as their gateway to Jamaica's signature waterfall attractions, which lie just minutes away in the surrounding hills.</p>

      <h4>Falmouth</h4>
      <p>Royal Caribbean invested heavily in developing Falmouth's deep-water berth specifically to accommodate the massive Oasis-class and other mega-ships that cannot dock elsewhere on the island. The modern cruise terminal opened in recent years, complete with shopping pavilions and tourist amenities. Beyond the cruise facility, the authentic Georgian-era town center preserves centuries of Caribbean colonial history, offering a fascinating contrast to the contemporary port infrastructure.</p>

      <h4>Montego Bay</h4>
      <p>Known locally as "MoBay," this western port serves double duty as Jamaica's primary airport city and a major resort destination. The cruise terminal provides convenient access to the famous Doctor's Cave Beach, duty-free shopping districts, and the concentrated energy of Jamaica's tourism heartland. Many visitors choose to explore the resort strip or venture inland to plantation tours and adventure parks.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Dunn's River Falls Detailed Section -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Dunn's River Falls: Jamaica's Signature Experience</h3>
      <p>Among Jamaica's natural wonders, Dunn's River Falls stands as the undisputed crown jewel. This spectacular 600-foot cascade tumbles down naturally terraced limestone formations directly toward the Caribbean Sea, creating one of the few climbable waterfalls anywhere in the world. The falls flow continuously from mountain springs, creating a stunning white veil against the lush tropical vegetation that frames both sides.</p>

      <p>The journey begins at sea level, where visitors remove shoes and wade into the cool mountain water flowing over smooth rocks. Professional guides organize climbers into human chains, linking hands to form stable lines that ascend together through the rushing current. The terraced structure creates natural stepping zones where you can pause to catch your breath, snap photos, and feel the power of water surging around your legs. Natural pools punctuate the climb, offering opportunities for swimming and basking in the mineral-rich water before continuing upward.</p>

      <p>Plan to dedicate between one hour and ninety minutes for the complete climb, including multiple rest stops where guides share local knowledge and help position groups for memorable photos. The experience demands proper footwear — water shoes provide essential grip on the slippery limestone surfaces. The park rents suitable shoes for approximately seventeen dollars, though experienced waterfall climbers often bring their own proven pairs.</p>

      <p>For those seeking additional thrills beyond the falls themselves, the park offers seven ziplines and four suspension bridges that provide aerial perspectives of the cascading water and surrounding rainforest canopy. These adventure elements transform Dunn's River from a single waterfall climb into a full-day adventure park experience. After conquering the falls, visitors can relax on the nearby beach, where the freshwater meets the Caribbean in a perfect blend of mountain stream and ocean waves.</p>

      <p>Protecting your electronics matters here, as spray and splashes are constant companions throughout the ascent. Waterproof phone cases or dry bags keep your devices functional while capturing the adventure. Many visitors pack small dry pouches inside their pockets for cash and cards.</p>

      <p>Distance from ports varies significantly. Ocho Rios cruise passengers enjoy the advantage of proximity — just five minutes of travel separates the pier from the falls entrance. From Falmouth, the newly constructed highway reduces the journey to approximately ninety minutes, making the trip feasible even on shorter port days. The park opens early to accommodate cruise schedules, with morning arrivals typically experiencing smaller crowds and shorter wait times.</p>

    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Beyond the Falls: More Jamaica Adventures</h3>

      <h4>Martha Brae River Rafting</h4>
      <p>Just five minutes from Falmouth's cruise port, the Martha Brae River offers one of Jamaica's most serene experiences — a journey that feels like floating through a botanical garden. Your raft captain, standing at the stern of a hand-crafted thirty-foot bamboo raft, poles you silently downstream through three miles of tropical paradise. The gentle current does all the work while you recline on cushioned seats, trailing fingers in cool water, watching egrets fish along the banks and listening to nothing but birdsong and rustling palm fronds.</p>

      <p>The journey takes roughly an hour, moving at nature's pace through sections of dense jungle canopy that filter sunlight into golden streams, then emerging into open meadows where the sky spreads blue and infinite overhead. Many raft captains double as natural historians, pointing out tropical flowers, naming the birds that dart across the water, and sharing stories of the river's history. Some even serenade passengers with traditional Jamaican folk songs. This is Jamaica at its most peaceful — the antidote to every hectic waterfall climb and crowded beach.</p>

      <h4>Luminous Lagoon: Jamaica's Glowing Wonder</h4>
      <p>Wait until dark falls over Falmouth, and one of nature's most mesmerizing displays comes alive in the shallow bay waters. Millions upon millions of microscopic dinoflagellates — bioluminescent organisms invisible by day — transform the lagoon into liquid starlight. When your boat cuts through the water, greenish-blue trails glow in its wake like underwater lightning. Dip your hand in, and watch ghostly light drip from your fingers. Jump in for a swim, and your every movement creates luminous outlines that reveal fish darting beneath the surface in trails of eerie radiance.</p>

      <p>The phenomenon occurs naturally in only a few places worldwide, and the Luminous Lagoon near Falmouth provides one of the most reliable displays. Tour operators lead evening boat trips that include swimming opportunities in the glowing water — an experience that feels like diving into a galaxy. The dinoflagellates are harmless to humans; their bioluminescence is simply a defense mechanism that lights up when disturbed. Cameras struggle to capture the effect, making this one of those rare modern experiences that must be witnessed rather than photographed.</p>

      <h4>Good Hope Estate: Sugar Plantation to Adventure Park</h4>
      <p>Step back into the mid-1700s at Good Hope Estate, a magnificently restored sugar plantation that sprawls across 2,000 acres of Jamaica's interior highlands. The great house and surrounding buildings tell the complete story of Jamaica's sugar era — the wealth it generated, the architectural grandeur it financed, and the brutal labor system that sustained it. Period furnishings and detailed historical exhibits bring that complex past into sharp focus.</p>

      <p>But Good Hope has evolved beyond static museum. The same land that once grew sugar cane now hosts river tubing adventures down the Martha Brae, zipline courses through the property's extensive forest canopy, and ATV rides along mountain trails that reveal stunning vistas of the Cockpit Country. The restored buildings include a restaurant serving authentic Jamaican cuisine using traditional recipes and modern accommodations for those who want to extend their stay beyond a day visit. History, natural beauty, and adventure combine here in proportions that satisfy diverse interests.</p>

      <h4>Green Grotto Caves: Underground Jamaica</h4>
      <p>Descend into a hidden world that played surprising roles throughout Jamaica's turbulent history. These extensive limestone caverns, carved by water over millions of years, provided refuge for Spanish soldiers hiding from English invaders during the seventeenth-century battles for Caribbean dominance. Later, they sheltered smugglers, runaway slaves seeking freedom, and during World War II, rum stored for military use.</p>

      <p>Modern pathways with proper lighting now guide visitors through cathedral-sized chambers where stalactites hang like stone chandeliers and stalagmites rise from the cave floor in fantastic formations. The tour culminates at Grotto Lake, an underground body of water so clear it mirrors the ceiling perfectly, creating disorienting reflections. The constant 77-degree temperature inside provides blessed relief from Jamaica's tropical heat, while the geological formations and historical narratives combine to create one of the island's most distinctive attractions.</p>

      <h4>Horseback Ocean Riding</h4>
      <p>Few experiences match the surreal joy of riding horses directly into the Caribbean Sea, yet Jamaica offers exactly this unusual adventure. Guided rides begin on sandy beaches before continuing into the surf, where horses wade chest-deep through gentle waves. The combination of horseback riding and ocean swimming creates a distinctly Jamaican memory that surprises even experienced equestrians.</p>

      <h4>Mystic Mountain</h4>
      <p>This adventure park perched above Ocho Rios delivers adrenaline through multiple attractions centered on the famous bobsled ride. Inspired by Jamaica's Olympic bobsled team, the gravity-driven sleds race down through rainforest canopy on a controlled track where riders control their own speed. Zipline courses add aerial perspectives of the surrounding mountains and coastline.</p>

      <h4>Blue Hole</h4>
      <p>Sometimes called the Secret Falls or Island Gully Falls, this jungle waterfall complex attracts adventurous spirits seeking a more intimate encounter with Jamaica's natural beauty. Unlike the organized crowds at Dunn's River, Blue Hole maintains a wilder atmosphere where visitors cliff-jump into sapphire pools, swing from rope swings, and explore mineral-rich swimming holes away from mass tourism. Local guides lead the way through increasingly daring jumps ranging from modest five-foot drops to heart-pounding twenty-five-foot leaps.</p>

    <!-- Falmouth Historic Town Section -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Falmouth's Georgian Heritage</h3>
      <p>Walk past the modern cruise terminal into Falmouth's historic center, and you step back into 1790 — the year Edward Barrett carved this Georgian jewel from his plantation lands. Within decades, Falmouth became one of the Western Hemisphere's busiest ports, its streets named for British royalty and naval heroes: King Street, Queen Street, Rodney Street honoring Admiral Lord George Rodney, Wellington Street echoing England's Iron Duke.</p>

      <p>Here's a fact that stops visitors in their tracks: Falmouth installed the first piped water supply in the entire Western Hemisphere in 1799. While European cities still relied on wells and water carriers, Falmouth's Georgian mansions enjoyed running water flowing through a sophisticated municipal system. That pioneering spirit infused everything about this port town during its golden age.</p>

      <p>But Falmouth's history carries profound weight beyond architectural elegance. This town became a crucible of the abolition movement, its buildings serving as safe houses during slave revolts, its people fueling the moral fire that would eventually break the chains of slavery throughout the British Empire. The William Knibb Memorial Baptist Church stands as living testimony to that struggle — built by the missionary leader who devoted his life to abolition, preaching freedom and human dignity when such words carried the risk of death.</p>

      <p>Jamaica designated Falmouth a National Monument in 1996, protecting one of the Caribbean's finest concentrations of Georgian colonial architecture. The symmetrical facades, covered verandas, decorative fretwork, and proportioned windows tell stories of wealth built on sugar, commerce conducted across oceans, and eventually, liberation fought for in these very streets.</p>

      <h4>Historic Falmouth Attractions Worth Visiting</h4>
      <p>Walking tours of historic Falmouth reveal layers of history compressed into compact blocks. St. Peter's Anglican Church, consecrated in 1795, rises with Georgian solemnity near the town square, its bell tower marking time across two centuries. The Falmouth Courthouse and the nearby historic Falmouth Jail stand as reminders of British colonial law and order, their stones holding memories of trials, sentences, and the administration of justice during Jamaica's plantation era.</p>

      <p>Edward Barrett's town house — the founder's own residence — survives as architectural testimony to the wealth sugar generated. Nearby, John Tharp's former residence represents another chapter of that same story, the plantation owner's urban retreat from his vast agricultural holdings. These buildings don't hide their origins; they stand as frank historical evidence of the system that created them and the people who suffered under it.</p>

      <p>The Albert George Shopping and Historical Centre transforms historic preservation into modern utility, its restored buildings now housing shops and galleries while maintaining their Georgian character. The Albert George Market buzzes with energy as vendors sell Jamaican souvenirs, local treats, handcrafts, and the spirited negotiations that make Caribbean markets such vibrant experiences. Here, history becomes living culture rather than static monument.</p>

      <p>Organized walking tours led by knowledgeable local guides illuminate Falmouth's layered past, connecting architectural details to human stories of prosperity, oppression, resistance, and ultimately transformation. These walks typically last between one and two hours, covering the compact historic district at a contemplative pace that allows the town's significance to settle in your understanding.</p>

      <h3>Getting Around Jamaica</h3>
      <p>Falmouth has a modern cruise pier with a small shopping area walkable from the ship. The real Jamaica, though, requires wheels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From Falmouth to Dunn's River Falls:</strong> 45 minutes (taxi or private driver)</li>
        <li><strong>From Falmouth to Blue Hole:</strong> 50 minutes (near Ocho Rios, combine with Dunn's River)</li>
        <li><strong>From Falmouth to Scotchies (Ocho Rios):</strong> 40 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>From Falmouth to Montego Bay:</strong> 25 minutes</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Negotiate a full-day rate with a driver rather than paying per stop. Licensed taxi drivers have red plates and JUTA (Jamaica Union of Travellers Association) stickers.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Word of Warning -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

      <h4>Safety Guidelines for Cruise Visitors</h4>
      <p>Jamaica rewards smart travelers who exercise common-sense precautions. The golden rule centers on staying within organized tour groups or remaining in designated port areas when exploring independently. The cruise terminal zones in Falmouth, Ocho Rios, and Montego Bay maintain professional security and welcome atmospheres designed specifically for visiting passengers.</p>

      <p>Certain neighborhoods in Jamaica's cities face genuine challenges with crime and poverty. Independent wandering into unfamiliar areas away from tourist zones carries unnecessary risks. Book excursions through reputable operators, hire licensed transportation, and keep your adventures focused on the well-established attractions that cater to cruise visitors. The tourism industry professionals understand their role as ambassadors for their island and work hard to ensure positive experiences.</p>

      <p>Near the ports, you will encounter enthusiastic vendors eager to sell souvenirs, tours, or services. The sales approach can feel aggressive to visitors unaccustomed to Caribbean market culture. A polite but firm "no thank you" repeated as necessary works effectively. Avoid stopping to negotiate or engage in extended conversations unless you genuinely intend to purchase. The vendors respect clear boundaries delivered with courtesy.</p>

      <h4>Currency and Money Matters</h4>
      <p>United States dollars receive widespread acceptance throughout Jamaica's tourism infrastructure. Restaurants, shops, tour operators, and taxi drivers all readily handle American currency, eliminating the need for most visitors to exchange money. That said, dealing in Jamaican dollars often yields slightly better pricing for goods and services, as exchange rates favor local currency transactions.</p>

      <p>ATMs dispensing Jamaican dollars operate in all port areas, though fees can accumulate quickly for international withdrawals. Credit cards work reliably at established businesses, but cash remains king for smaller vendors, market stalls, and independent operators. Carry a mix of small bills to facilitate smooth transactions and avoid the perennial "no change available" complications.</p>

      <h4>Transportation Negotiations</h4>
      <p>Taxi fares in Jamaica operate largely on negotiation rather than meters, making upfront price agreements essential before entering any vehicle. Licensed taxi operators display red license plates and official Jamaica Union of Travellers Association (JUTA) credentials. These identifiers signal drivers who undergo training and background checks specifically to serve cruise passengers.</p>

      <p>Establish the complete fare for your intended route before departure, confirming whether the price covers your full party or applies per person. Ask whether the rate includes waiting time if you plan to have the driver remain at your destination. Getting these details clarified prevents uncomfortable disputes upon return to the ship.</p>

      <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
      <p>Jamaica's climate remains tropical year-round, but the November through March period delivers the most consistently pleasant conditions for cruise visitors. These months fall within the Caribbean dry season, bringing lower humidity, reduced rainfall, and comfortable temperatures ideal for waterfall climbing, beach time, and outdoor adventures. The Christmas and New Year holidays bring peak crowds to popular attractions.</p>

      <p>Summer months (June through October) coincide with hurricane season, bringing increased chances of rain and occasional tropical systems. Many cruise lines adjust itineraries or skip Jamaican ports entirely during severe weather. The shoulder months of April, May, and early November often provide excellent combinations of favorable weather and thinner tourist crowds.</p>

      <h4>Essential Items to Pack</h4>
      <p>The legendary Jamaican hospitality runs deep here — expect vendors to be enthusiastic and drivers to have strong opinions about the best jerk spots (they're usually right). "Soon come" timing is the island's gentle reminder to slow down, breathe in the sea air, and embrace irie vibes. Bring cash (USD accepted everywhere but local currency gets better deals), wear water shoes to the falls, and don't skip the festivals at Scotchies.</p>

    <!-- Jamaican Culture, Food & Music -->
    <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Tasting Jamaica: Food, Music, and Island Culture</h3>
      <p>Jamaica doesn't just feed you — it baptizes you in flavors you'll chase for the rest of your life. The island's culinary identity centers on jerk, that perfect marriage of fiery scotch bonnet peppers, warming allspice, and smoke from pimento wood that permeates meat slow-cooked over open pits. Jerk chicken arrives crispy-skinned and fall-apart tender, the heat building gradually until you're reaching for another Red Stripe to cool the fire. Scotchies remains the undisputed master, but roadside jerk stands across the island each guard their own secret spice blends.</p>

      <p>Patties — those golden, flaky pastry pockets filled with spiced beef, chicken, or vegetables — serve as Jamaica's national fast food, available from dedicated shops, gas stations, and vendors' carts. They're portable, affordable, and dangerously addictive. Eat them fresh and hot, when the pastry shatters at first bite and steam rises from the savory filling.</p>

      <p>But for the dish that makes Jamaicans most nostalgic, look to ackee and saltfish — the national breakfast that combines sautéed ackee fruit (which tastes remarkably like scrambled eggs despite being botanical) with salted codfish, onions, tomatoes, and scotch bonnet peppers. Served alongside fried dumplings, boiled green bananas, and breadfruit, this hearty plate fuels fishermen, farmers, and anyone wise enough to start their day the Jamaican way. Many restaurants near the ports serve it all day for visitors who arrive too late for proper breakfast timing.</p>

      <p>Festival — those slightly sweet fried dumplings that accompany jerk plates — deserve special mention. The cornmeal dough fries up crispy outside, fluffy inside, with just enough sugar to balance the heat from whatever jerk meat you've ordered. Locals dip them in the spicy pan drippings; tourists learn to do the same.</p>

      <h4>Reggae: The Heartbeat of Jamaica</h4>
      <p>Before you even clear customs at the cruise terminal, reggae's unmistakable riddim will find you. This is the music that gave the world Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, and Burning Spear — the sound that transformed Jamaican roots into global consciousness. That steady offbeat, the deep bass lines, the lyrics speaking of struggle, love, unity, and liberation — reggae doesn't just play in Jamaica; it pulses through the island like a second heartbeat.</p>

      <p>Every taxi ride becomes a mobile concert as drivers share their favorite tracks. Restaurant sound systems broadcast classic roots reggae between sets from modern dancehall artists who've taken the tradition in new directions. Beach bars keep the vibes irie from noon until last call. Even souvenir shops curate reggae playlists that make shopping feel like a celebration.</p>

      <p>The philosophy embedded in reggae — "One Love," the rejection of oppression, the embrace of natural living, the call for justice — these aren't just lyrical themes. They're lived values that shape Jamaican culture and welcome visitors into a worldview where human connection matters more than rushing from one scheduled activity to another. When a local tells you "irie, mon," they're not performing for tourists. They're inviting you into that mindset where everything's alright, where stress dissolves in saltwater and sunshine, where the rhythm carries you forward.</p>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Should I do Dunn's River Falls or Blue Hole?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Both if you can! They're near each other (both by Ocho Rios) and can be combined with a private driver. Dunn's River is iconic and family-friendly; Blue Hole is more adventurous with cliff jumping. If forced to choose one: Blue Hole for thrill-seekers, Dunn's River for the bucket-list photo.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Where's the best jerk chicken?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Scotchies. Full stop. Locations in Montego Bay and Ocho Rios. The jerk is authentic (pimento wood smoke, serious spice), and the festival dumplings are perfect. Get there before 2 PM as they can run out of popular items.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is Jamaica safe for cruise visitors?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Stick with licensed drivers (red plates, JUTA stickers), don't wander far from tourist areas alone, and you'll be fine. Falmouth's cruise area is modern and secure. The Jamaicans working in tourism are incredibly welcoming.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What should I bring to the waterfalls?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Water shoes (essential — rocks are slippery), waterproof phone case, towel, change of clothes for after. Lockers available at Dunn's River for valuables. Wear your swimsuit under clothes.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is the Luminous Lagoon worth a night tour?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Absolutely. It's one of the most unique natural phenomena you'll ever witness — swimming in water that glows with bioluminescence is surreal and unforgettable. Tours run after dark (usually 7-9 PM), so check if your ship will still be in port. Best on moonless nights when the glow is brightest.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What Jamaican food should I try beyond jerk chicken?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Don't miss ackee and saltfish (the national dish — tastes like savory scrambled eggs), beef patties (flaky pastry pockets perfect for snacking), and festival (sweet fried dumplings that come with jerk). Wash it down with fresh coconut water or homemade ginger beer. If you're adventurous, try curry goat.</p>
