      "markdown": "**Allura launched in 2025 as [Vista](/ships/oceania/vista.html)'s sister—confirming the Allura Class as Oceania's future direction.**\n\nThe specifications match Vista exactly: 1,200 guests, same dining venues, same public spaces, same upper-premium positioning. The design represents Oceania's careful expansion—growth that preserves rather than abandons brand identity.\n\nSecond ships in a class benefit from first-ship experience. Vista's inaugural season informed Allura's final touches. The operational refinements may be subtle but compound across the voyage.\n\nThe Allura Class naming signals intent—both ships evoke aspiration and beauty rather than generic cruise ship conventions. Oceania chose names that reflect their atmosphere.\n\nFor Allura Class choice: select based on itinerary and timing rather than expecting ship differences. Both vessels deliver identical experience. The choice becomes where you want to sail, not which ship you prefer.",

      "markdown": "**Choosing your first Oceania ship? Allura offers the newest expression of what made the brand distinctive.**\n\nOceania occupies unique market position—above mainstream premium lines, below ultra-luxury. The value proposition: culinary excellence, destination focus, elegant atmosphere at prices below Silversea or Seabourn.\n\nAllura delivers this formula with latest facilities. The ship feels new—because she is. The venues reflect current design trends. The technology runs current generation.\n\nCompared to R Class ships ([Regatta](/ships/oceania/regatta.html), [Insignia](/ships/oceania/insignia.html), [Nautica](/ships/oceania/nautica.html), [Sirena](/ships/oceania/sirena.html)), Allura offers larger staterooms, more dining options, expanded spa. The trade-off: less intimate atmosphere, larger passenger community.\n\nFor Oceania introduction: Allura provides excellent entry point. The newest ship showcases the brand's current vision. Whether you prefer this or seek R Class intimacy depends on your priorities.",

      "markdown": "**Oceania distinguishes itself through destination focus—itineraries that visit places larger ships cannot, with more time in ports that matter.**\n\nAllura's 1,200-guest capacity fits ports that mega-ships overwhelm. Historic Mediterranean harbors, smaller Caribbean islands, boutique destinations—the ship accesses what mass-market vessels skip.\n\nOceania itineraries typically feature fewer sea days than competitors. The focus remains destination discovery. Port schedules often extend into evening, enabling dinner ashore rather than forcing early return.\n\nThe brand attracts destination-focused travelers. Fellow passengers care about where they're going, not just ship amenities. Conversation centers on travel experiences, cultural observations, destination recommendations.\n\nFor destination priorities: Allura serves itineraries designed by travelers for travelers. The ship is transport to exceptional places, not destination unto itself. Oceania understands the difference.",
