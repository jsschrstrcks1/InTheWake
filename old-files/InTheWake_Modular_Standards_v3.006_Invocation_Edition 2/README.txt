📘 In the Wake — Modular Standards v3.006 Invocation Edition
Release Date: 2025-10-10
Maintainer: abondservant — a bondservant of Christ
Motto: “Do all to the glory of God.” — 1 Cor 10:31

This archive contains the authoritative, unified frontend and editorial standards for the In the Wake project.
It consolidates all prior 2.x and 3.0x branches into a single canonical edition, structured by module and annotated with invocation headers for reverence, provenance, and stewardship.

Each page built under these standards must be coded, styled, and written as an offering to God—carefully, faithfully, and with joy.
Every update to these standards shall be reread, prayed over, and verified before any public deployment.

Soli Deo Gloria.
