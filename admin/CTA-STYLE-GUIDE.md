# CTA Style Guide — In the Wake

## Philosophy

CTAs on In the Wake serve as **wayfinding**, not conversion pressure. We're fellow cruisers pointing you toward helpful resources, not salespeople trying to close a deal.

### Core Principles

1. **Helpful, not urgent** — "When you're ready" not "Don't miss out"
2. **Specific, not vague** — "See 47 dining menus" not "Discover amazing options"
3. **Calm, not panicked** — Trust that good content doesn't need hype
4. **Contextual, not intrusive** — CTAs belong where they make sense, not everywhere

---

## Voice Guidelines

### DO Use
- Straightforward language ("Run the numbers", "Take the quiz")
- Specific benefits ("Compare 28 Royal Caribbean ships")
- Gentle invitations ("When you're ready to plan...")
- Helpful framing ("Here's where to find...")
- Questions that orient ("Not sure which ship?")

### DON'T Use
- Urgency language ("Limited time!", "Act now!", "Don't miss out!")
- Emotional manipulation ("Your dream cruise awaits!")
- Vague promises ("Unlock the secrets", "Discover hidden gems")
- Excessive exclamation points (one per page maximum, if any)
- Superlatives without substance ("The BEST tips!", "Amazing deals!")
- FOMO tactics ("Everyone else is...")

## CTA Formats

### 1. Inline Text CTAs
Natural mentions within content that link to related resources.

**Good:**
> If you're still choosing between ships, the [Ship Quiz](/ships/quiz.html) takes about 2 minutes and narrows down the fleet based on your priorities.

**Bad:**
> Take our AMAZING Ship Quiz NOW to find your PERFECT cruise ship! You won't believe the results!

### 2. Section-End CTAs
Placed after a content section to guide next steps.

**Good:**
> **Ready to compare ships?** Browse the [ship database](/ships.html) or take the [2-minute quiz](/ships/quiz.html).

**Bad:**
> DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT checking out our incredible ship comparison tools!!!

### 3. Related Resources Blocks
Grid of 3-4 contextually relevant links (already implemented on tool pages).

**Format:**
```
Now that you've [completed action]...
- [Resource 1] — [brief benefit]
- [Resource 2] — [brief benefit]
- [Resource 3] — [brief benefit]
```

### 4. Contextual Callouts
Highlighted boxes for specific user needs.

**Good:**
> **Cruising solo?** We have a dedicated section with practical tips and real stories from solo travelers. [Read more →](/solo.html)

**Bad:**
> 🚨 ATTENTION SOLO CRUISERS! 🚨 Click here for EXCLUSIVE tips!!!

## Placement Guidelines

### Where CTAs Belong
- End of content sections (natural transition point)
- Related Resources blocks (after tool completion)
- Intent selector (homepage routing)
- Sidebar/rail (secondary, non-intrusive)
- Within content where contextually relevant

### Where CTAs Don't Belong
- Popups or modals (unless user-initiated)
- Fixed bars that follow scrolling
- Multiple times for the same destination on one page
- Interrupting content mid-paragraph
- Every single page element

---

## Testing & Iteration

### Measure
- Click-through rates on Related Resources
- Bounce rate changes (are people finding next steps?)
- Time on site (are CTAs helping exploration?)

### Don't Measure
- "Conversion rate" (we're not selling anything)
- Urgency-driven metrics (clicks from FOMO)

---

## Examples in Context

### Good: Drink Calculator Page
After the calculator results:
> **Now that you've run the numbers...**
> Continue planning with these related resources.
> - Restaurant Menus — See dining options & prices
> - Drink Package Guide — Deep dive into policies
> - Ship Database — Compare ships & classes

### Bad: Hypothetical Marketing Version
> 🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! You've calculated your drinks! 🎉
> But WAIT — there's MORE! Don't miss these INCREDIBLE resources:
> - AMAZING Restaurant Menus — You won't BELIEVE the options!
> - The ULTIMATE Drink Package Guide — Secrets REVEALED!
> - Ship Database — Find your DREAM ship TODAY!
