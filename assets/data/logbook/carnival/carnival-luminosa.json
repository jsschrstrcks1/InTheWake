      "markdown": "**Costa Luminosa became Carnival Luminosa — Spirit-class ship joining Spirit-class fleet.**\n\nThe 2022 transfer brought Luminosa from Costa to Carnival. Unlike Vista-class transfers, Luminosa joined existing Spirit-class sisters — Spirit, Pride, Legend, Miracle.\n\nSpirit-class transfers make operational sense. Crew training applies across class. Maintenance procedures match. The ship integrated with established systems.\n\nLuminosa's name means 'luminous' in Italian. Carnival retained the name, maintaining identity while changing brand. The light-themed vessel kept her radiant designation.\n\nMy wheelchair appreciates Spirit-class familiarity. Ships sharing class architecture share accessibility features. What works on Carnival Spirit works on Carnival Luminosa.\n\nThe transfer expanded Spirit-class presence. Five ships instead of four. The class gained capacity through brand transfer efficiency."
