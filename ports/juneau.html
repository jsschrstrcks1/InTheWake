      <h2>My Juneau Logbook</h2>

      <p>I've been lucky enough to visit Juneau multiple times on Royal Caribbean Alaska cruises between 2023 and 2025, and every single time it blows me away. There's something about sailing into the Gastineau Channel with those dramatic mountains dropping straight into the sea, eagles soaring overhead, and that crisp pine-scented air that makes you feel more alive than you've felt in months. Juneau is consistently one of the highest-rated ports across Cruise Critic, Reddit, and Royal's own feedback — often scoring 4.8–5 stars from thousands of cruisers — and I completely understand why.</p>

      <p>What I love most about Juneau is how it perfectly blends raw wilderness adventure with accessible city charm. This is Alaska's capital, but there are no roads in or out — you arrive by air or sea only, and that isolation gives it a frontier authenticity that Ketchikan and Skagway don't quite match. The downtown is walkable and surprisingly cosmopolitan, but you're never more than a few minutes from glaciers, bears, whales, and waterfalls. It feels like the heart of Alaska.</p>

      <p>What makes Juneau even more remarkable is its history and unique position in the American landscape. This is the only state capital in the entire country you cannot reach by road — no highways connect it to the outside world, only seaplanes and cruise ships can deliver you to its doorstep. Juneau became Alaska's capital in 1906, replacing the older Russian settlement of Sitka, but the modern city's story truly began in 1880 when prospectors Richard Harris and Joe Juneau struck gold at Gold Creek, sparking Alaska's first major gold rush. Thousands poured into these mountains chasing fortune, and the legacy of that era still echoes through old mining tunnels and museum exhibits downtown. But long before the gold-seekers arrived, this land belonged to the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples, whose rich cultures and deep knowledge of these waters stretch back thousands of years across Southeast Alaska's Inside Passage — that breathtaking labyrinth of fjords, islands, and channels carved between towering coastal mountains and the icy waters of the Pacific.</p>

      <p>The whale-watching tours are legendary, and they've earned that reputation — Juneau is widely regarded as one of the best places on Earth to see humpback whales in their summer feeding grounds. I've done the guaranteed-sighting excursions multiple times, and on my most memorable trip we encountered dozens of humpbacks bubble-net feeding right next to the boat. If you've never seen this behavior, it's mesmerizing — a group of whales works together to blow bubbles in a spiral that traps fish, then they lunge through the surface with their mouths wide open in coordinated precision. We also saw breaching, tail-slapping, and spy-hopping so close I could have reached out and touched them. The operators know these waters intimately. They know where the whales congregate. You will see whales.</p>

      <div class="poignant-highlight">
        <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> It was my third visit to Juneau, a gray afternoon with mist hanging low over the mountains. I'd taken a helicopter to Mendenhall Glacier and we landed on the ice itself for dog-sledding — yes, actual sled dogs on actual glacier ice in the middle of July. The huskies were absurdly happy, barking with excitement, and as the sled glided across that ancient blue ice with the mountains rising on every side and total silence except for the dogs' panting and the runners' swish, I felt something shift inside me. This wasn't a vacation moment. This was a "what am I doing with my life" moment. Alaska has a way of making everything else feel small, and standing on that glacier with nothing but wilderness in every direction, I understood why people come back here over and over until it becomes a kind of pilgrimage.
      </div>

      <p>Mendenhall Glacier is the headliner attraction, and it deserves the hype. The visitor center is excellent — great exhibits, rangers who genuinely want to share their knowledge, and huge windows framing the glacier and Nugget Falls. The hike to Nugget Falls is my favorite easy option: a well-maintained trail, about 30–45 minutes each way, leading to a massive waterfall pouring off the rocks with the glacier looming behind it. You can walk right up to the base and feel the icy mist on your face. It's spectacular and accessible to most fitness levels. For more adventure, the trails to East Glacier and West Glacier viewpoints are longer but worth every step.</p>

      <p>If your budget allows, the helicopter glacier landing is worth it. I'm not someone who usually splurges on big-ticket excursions, but flying over the Juneau Icefield and setting down on Mendenhall or Herbert Glacier for dog-sledding or a walking tour is genuinely transformational. You see crevasses and meltwater pools and the sheer scale of the ice in a way that's impossible from the shore. It's expensive, but this is Alaska — you might only come once.</p>

      <p>Back in town, the Mount Roberts Tramway gives you that instant wow-factor view over the city, channel, and cruise ships without any effort — just buy a ticket and ride up. At the top there are hiking trails, a raptor center, a nature theater, and the Timberline Bar & Grill where I've nursed a local beer while watching eagles circle below me. The downtown itself is charming in a rough-edged Alaskan way: art galleries, jewelry shops, and the famous Red Dog Saloon with its sawdust floors, live music, mounted animal heads, and "duck fart" shots that taste better than they sound. Tracy's King Crab Shack is mandatory — the crab bisque alone is worth rearranging your port day around, and the crab legs are as fresh as it gets.</p>

      <p>I've also done the salmon bakes and highly recommend them for an authentic Alaskan experience — all-you-can-eat fresh-caught salmon, halibut, and reindeer sausage cooked over open fires in the rainforest, with storytelling and local beer. The Alaska State Museum in the new heritage center is world-class if you want to understand Native Tlingit culture and Alaska's history. And honestly, just walking the streets and looking at the mountains is enough. The glacial peaks surrounding Juneau are so dramatic they don't look real.</p>

      <p>Juneau is Alaska condensed into one port day. You can whale watch and glacier hike and eat king crab and explore a gold-rush capital all before 5 PM. The aggregate reviews from thousands of cruisers put it at or near the top of every Alaska port ranking, and I've never met anyone who regretted prioritizing it. If you only do one Alaska cruise in your life and you only have one day to truly invest in, make it Juneau.</p>

    <!-- Navigation & Practical Info -->
    <article class="card">
      <section class="port-section">
      <h3>Getting Around Juneau</h3>
      <p>Juneau is one of the easiest Alaskan ports to navigate — it's an easy walking town. Most Royal Caribbean ships dock right downtown at the AJ Dock, Franklin Dock, or nearby berths — you walk off the gangway into the heart of the city in under 5 minutes.</p>

      <h4>Docking</h4>
      <p>Three main cruise terminals serve Juneau: <strong>Marine Park</strong>, <strong>Ferry Terminal</strong>, and <strong>S. Franklin Dock</strong> — all within easy walking distance to town. When 4+ ships dock simultaneously, vessels may anchor and tender passengers ashore. A new $54M floating berth on Douglas Island is scheduled to open in spring 2027.</p>

      <h4>Transportation Options</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Juneau is an easy walking town. Downtown shops, restaurants, tram, and museums are all 5–15 minutes on flat sidewalks from the cruise terminals <span class="distance-fun">approximately 6 football fields, 24 blue whales end-to-end, or 528 emperor penguins stacked skyward</span></li>
        <li><strong>Mendenhall Glacier Shuttle:</strong> 13 miles from downtown, approximately 1 hour by shuttle. Round-trip fares run $65–80. The drive takes 20–30 minutes through beautiful scenery.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available but very expensive. Expect $30–40 one way to Mendenhall Glacier.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Transit:</strong> Capital Transit bus service is available, but the closest glacier stop is still 2 miles away from the visitor center — budget-minded but not ideal for glacier visits.</li>
        <li><strong>Whale Watching Boats:</strong> 5-minute walk from pier to harbor departure points <span class="distance-fun">roughly 33 school buses, 16 blue whales end-to-end, or 352 emperor penguins forming an improbable tower</span></li>
        <li><strong>Helicopter Tours:</strong> Short transfer provided by operator</li>
        <li><strong>Airport:</strong> Juneau International Airport is 10 miles from downtown</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The visitor center right at the pier has free maps and friendly locals ready to point you in the right direction.</p>

      <h3>Depth Soundings Ashore</h3>
        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>

      <h4>Weather & What to Bring</h4>
      <p>"It rains a lot here" — Juneau sits in a temperate rainforest, and that famous liquid sunshine is part of what keeps everything so vibrantly green, the waterfalls roaring, and the glaciers feeding. Pack a light waterproof jacket and embrace those surprise rainbows that pop out over the mountains after a passing shower — they turn an ordinary walk into a postcard-perfect moment you'll never forget. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Book weather-dependent excursions (helicopter tours, glacier landings) on arrival rather than in advance when possible, to maximize your chances of clear skies.</p>

      <h4>Money & Tipping</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> US dollars. ATMs are everywhere throughout downtown.</li>
        <li><strong>Tipping Guidelines:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Restaurants: 15–20%</li>
            <li>Taxis: 10–15%</li>
            <li>Tour guides: $5–10 per person</li>
            <li>Bartenders: $1 per drink</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Practical Information</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WiFi:</strong> Free WiFi at Juneau Public Library (292 Marine Way). Open 11am–8pm Mon–Thu, noon–5pm Fri–Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> Dial 911</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key Attractions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mendenhall Glacier</strong> — 1 hour by shuttle, one of Alaska's most iconic sights</li>
        <li><strong>Mount Roberts Tramway</strong> — Ascend from 27ft to 2,000ft in just 6 minutes. Features trails, observatory, nature center, restaurant, bar, theater, and gift shops. All-day pass: $50</li>
        <li><strong>Whale Watching</strong> — Humpbacks, orcas, sea lions, and eagles. Most operators guarantee sightings.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracy Arm Fjord & Juneau Icefield</strong> — Stunning glacial scenery</li>
        <li><strong>Admiralty Island</strong> — Famous for brown bear viewing</li>
        <li><strong>Adventure Activities</strong> — Dog sledding, kayaking, rafting, hiking, glacier hiking, fishing</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Popular Excursions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wings Airways</strong> floatplane to Taku Lodge</li>
        <li><strong>Helicopter glacier landing tours</strong> — Land on the icefield for an unforgettable experience</li>
        <li><strong>Glacier Bay day trips</strong> — 37 miles away, full-day excursions available</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shopping</h4>
      <p>Downtown Juneau offers specialty shops featuring Native design jewelry, carved silver bracelets with totemic designs, authentic totem poles, and Tlingit artwork. These make meaningful souvenirs that support local artisans.</p>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always book your helicopter or whale watching excursions early — they sell out months ahead for good reason.</p>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How do I get to Mendenhall Glacier?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Mendenhall Glacier is 13 miles from downtown. Shuttle buses run constantly from the pier ($35–45 round-trip), or take a taxi for $30–40 one way. The drive is 20–30 minutes through beautiful scenery.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Are whale sightings guaranteed?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Most reputable operators offer guaranteed sightings or a refund. Humpback whales are extremely common in Juneau waters during cruise season (May–September). On many tours you'll see 10+ whales.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is the helicopter glacier tour worth the cost?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">If your budget allows, absolutely yes. Flying over the Juneau Icefield and landing on a glacier for dog-sledding or a walking tour is genuinely transformational. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most people.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.5rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">What should I eat in Juneau?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Tracy's King Crab Shack is legendary — the crab bisque and legs are outstanding. The salmon bakes offer all-you-can-eat fresh-caught fish. And the Red Dog Saloon is a fun, quirky stop for drinks and atmosphere.</p>

        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Juneau is Alaska's capital and adventure heart — Mendenhall Glacier, legendary whale watching, and stunning fjord scenery make it consistently the highest-rated Alaska port among cruisers, scoring 4.8–5 stars across thousands of reviews.
