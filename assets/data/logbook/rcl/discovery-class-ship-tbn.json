      "markdown": "**The name \"Discovery Class\" signals intent. While specifications await confirmation, the naming suggests Royal Caribbean may be exploring expedition or destination-focused cruising.**\n\nRoyal Caribbean's existing fleet prioritizes ship-as-destination experiences. [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) offers more onboard entertainment than most ports can match. [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) provides neighborhood variety that rivals small cities.\n\nDiscovery suggests different priorities. Discovery implies exploration, destination focus, experiences found through traveling rather than staying aboard. The cruise industry has seen growing interest in expedition cruising\u2014smaller ships accessing remote destinations\u2014and Royal Caribbean may be applying their scale and operational expertise to this segment.\n\nAlternatively, Discovery Class could bring traditional cruising to new itineraries: longer voyages, unusual ports, destination depth over ship entertainment.\n\nFor travelers watching this development: Discovery Class may serve guests who love Royal Caribbean's hospitality but seek destination-focused experiences. The name itself promises exploration.",

      "markdown": "**If you've achieved Crown & Anchor status and wonder where Royal Caribbean can still take you\u2014Discovery Class may provide the answer.**\n\nMega-ships face fundamental limitations. [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) cannot transit the Panama Canal. [Oasis class](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) ships cannot dock at smaller ports. The very scale that creates variety limits where these ships can sail.\n\nDiscovery Class likely addresses this gap. A smaller, more maneuverable vessel class could access ports that mega-ships bypass. Alaska's smaller harbors. Mediterranean villages. Expedition destinations in the Arctic or Antarctic.\n\nYour Crown & Anchor benefits would presumably apply\u2014Royal Caribbean maintains loyalty program continuity across the fleet. But the experience would differ: fewer onboard options, more destination focus, itineraries that trade entertainment for exploration.\n\nFor loyal guests who've sailed everywhere mega-ships reach: Discovery Class may open territories you thought required leaving the Royal Caribbean family. The discovery could be literal.\n\n**The lesson:** Experience teaches discernment. The best ships don't require comparison\u2014they end the search.",
