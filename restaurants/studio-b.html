      <h3>Studio B Review: Ice Skating at Sea — It Actually Works</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> I'll admit I was skeptical. Ice skating on a cruise ship sounded like a gimmick. But curiosity won, and I'm glad it did. Studio B delivers on its promise — yes, you can actually ice skate in the middle of the ocean, and it's genuinely fun.</p>

      <h4>Open Skating</h4>
      <p>I hadn't skated in probably 15 years, so I was nervous. The staff were incredibly helpful — they sized my skates properly and pointed me toward the rail to get my bearings. The rink isn't huge, but it's real ice and plenty big enough for recreational skating. After a few laps holding the rail, muscle memory kicked in and I was skating freely. The novelty of being on ice while the ocean passed by outside was surreal.</p>

      <h4>The Ice Show</h4>
      <p>That evening we caught the ice show, and I was impressed by the quality. These aren't amateur performers — the skaters execute complex jumps and spins with precision. The costumes were elaborate, the music was fun, and the choreography was tight. It's not Olympic-level, but it's professional entertainment that rivals anything you'd see at a mall rink show.</p>

      <h4>Family Experience</h4>
      <p>We brought our 8-year-old, who had only skated twice before. The staff gave her a skating aid (a plastic penguin-shaped support) that she could push around the rink. She loved it — went from terrified to confident in about 20 minutes. This is great family programming.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Studio B exceeded my expectations. <strong>Rating: 4.3/5.</strong> Try at least one skating session, especially on sea days when other activities are limited. The ice shows are worth seeing too. It's one of those unique cruise experiences that you can't get anywhere else — literally skating on ice while sailing through warm Caribbean waters.</p>
