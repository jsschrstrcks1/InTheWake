      <h3>Richard's Rooftop Review: The Best Bar on the Ship (If You Can Get In)</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Richard's Rooftop is the exclusive, adults-only (even more so than the rest of the adults-only ship) sundeck and cocktail lounge perched at the top of every Virgin Voyages ship. Access is restricted to RockStar Suite guests and those who purchase a day pass, making it the closest thing to a VIP experience on the fleet. The space features a private pool, hot tub, dedicated bar, and lounge seating with unobstructed ocean views. Bar Tab applies; day passes (when available) are an additional charge.</p>

      <h4>Drinks &amp; Service</h4>
      <p>The cocktail quality here is noticeably higher than the standard ship bars — the bartenders have the time and space to craft proper cocktails rather than churn through high-volume orders. The aperol spritz is the daytime signature and it is perfectly balanced — the right bitter-to-sweet ratio with quality prosecco. The paloma (tequila, grapefruit, lime, soda) is crisp and refreshing. The champagne service is a level above — actual champagne rather than sparkling wine, poured with ceremony. The espresso martini benefits from the lower volume — it is made with care rather than speed. Where it falls short: the premium positioning does not extend to the cocktail menu itself — the drinks are the same menu as the main bars, just better executed. There are no Richard's Rooftop exclusive cocktails, which feels like a missed opportunity for a premium venue. Wine by the glass is limited.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>This is where Richard's Rooftop truly excels. The staff-to-guest ratio is dramatically better than anywhere else on the ship. Servers bring drinks to your lounger without being flagged down. They remember your name and your order. The service style is attentive but not hovering — it channels the energy of a high-end beach club rather than a cruise ship bar. Towels are provided, sunscreen is offered, and the overall feeling is of being genuinely taken care of. This is the service standard that the entire ship aspires to but only this venue achieves.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>The view alone justifies the visit — unobstructed 180-degree ocean views from the highest accessible point on the ship. The design is clean and modern: white loungers, natural wood, and a calm that contrasts sharply with the pool-deck energy below. The crowd is smaller, quieter, and generally older (RockStar Suite guests skew toward the premium end of the demographic). The private pool and hot tub rarely feel crowded. Music is present but at conversation-friendly levels. Where it falls short: access restrictions mean most guests will never experience this venue. The day pass pricing can feel steep for what is essentially a nicer pool deck with better service. On cooler or overcast days, the outdoor-only setup is less appealing. The food menu is limited to light bites and snacks.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 4.2/5.</strong> Richard's Rooftop is the best bar experience on Virgin Voyages — superb service, well-made cocktails, stunning views, and a calm exclusivity that justifies its premium positioning. It falls short on cocktail menu creativity (same menu as below, just better made), food options (minimal), and the fundamental access barrier that keeps most guests out. If you are in a RockStar Suite, spend every afternoon here. <em>Tip:</em> ask about day passes at Sailor Services early in the voyage — availability is limited and they sell out, especially on sea days.</p>
