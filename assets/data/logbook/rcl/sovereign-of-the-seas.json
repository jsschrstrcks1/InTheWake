Five-story atrium with glass elevators. Two-deck dining room. Broadway-style theater. Multiple pools and hot tubs. These are standard now; in 1988, they were revolutionary.\n\nSovereign introduced features that became industry standards: the multi-deck atrium lobby, the tiered theater with unobstructed sightlines, dedicated kids' facilities, multiple specialty dining options beyond the main dining room.\n\nShe sailed primarily three- and four-night Bahamas loops from Miami, introducing millions of first-time cruisers to the industry. For many passengers, Sovereign *was* their first cruise\u2014the ship that proved cruising wasn't just for retirees or the wealthy.\n\n**The facts:**\n- Entered service: January 16, 1988\n- Gross tonnage: 73,192 GT\n- Capacity: 2,276 passengers (double occupancy)\n- Length: 880 feet\n- Pioneered: Multi-deck atrium, tiered theater design\n- Primary routes: Short Bahamas cruises from Miami\n- Retired: 2008 (sold, became Pullmantur Sovereign)\n\nSovereign proved the mega-ship concept worked.

      "markdown": "**Common praise from Sovereign passengers (documented in reviews and forums):**\n\n\"My first cruise ever. 1991, three nights to Nassau and back. I was hooked.\"\n\n\"The atrium was stunning\u2014five stories of glass and brass. Nothing else like it at the time.\"\n\n\"Short cruises from Miami were perfect for families on a budget. Long weekend, kids loved it, didn't break the bank.\"\n\n\"She wasn't fancy by today's standards, but she was solid. Good food, friendly crew, dependable.\"\n\n\"The dining room stretched two decks. You'd sit on the upper level and watch the lower level below. Felt grand.\"\n\n**Documented achievements:**\n- Introduced over 2 million passengers to cruising during her 20-year Royal Caribbean career\n- Maintained high satisfaction scores despite being the oldest mega-ship in the fleet by 2008\n- Known for reliable three- and four-night Bahamas itineraries that fit working families' schedules\n- Crew retention was notably high\u2014many crew members stayed on Sovereign for years\n\n**Industry impact:**\nSovereign's success led directly to [Monarch](/ships/rcl/monarch-of-the-seas.html) and [Majesty of the Seas](/ships/rcl/majesty-of-the-seas.html) (her sister ships), which further proved the mega-ship concept. By the mid-1990s, Royal Caribbean had committed to building even larger ships\u2014[Voyager class](/ships/rcl/voyager-of-the-seas.html) wouldn't exist without Sovereign's proof of concept.",
