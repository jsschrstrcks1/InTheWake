    check:
      type: "grep"
      pattern: "@media \\(prefers-reduced-motion"
    description: "Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations"
    rationale: "Users with vestibular disorders need reduced motion"
    example: |
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        * {
          animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
          transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
