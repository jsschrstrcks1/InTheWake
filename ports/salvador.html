        <h1>Salvador: Where Drums Echo Through Colonial Streets</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Salvador doesn't whisper its history — it drums it through cobblestone streets, paints it in yellow and blue and pink across colonial facades, spins it in the acrobatic dance of capoeira. This is Brazil's first capital, founded in 1549 when Portugal was carving an empire from the Atlantic coast. But it's also Brazil's most African city, shaped by centuries of enslaved people who brought their gods, their rhythms, their resilience across the Middle Passage. The result is a city like nowhere else on Earth — Portuguese baroque churches filled with enough gold to ransom kings, standing beside terreiros where Candomblé priests honor Yoruba orishas, all wrapped in the smell of dendê oil and the sound of berimbau strings.</p>

          <p>The cruise terminal sits in the Lower City, the working waterfront where commerce happens. But the soul of Salvador lives in the Upper City, reached by taxi or — far more memorably — by the Elevador Lacerda, an Art Deco elevator from the 1930s that lifts you 72 meters in thirty seconds. At the top: Pelourinho, the UNESCO World Heritage heart of the city. The name means "whipping post," a brutal reminder that this was the largest slave market in the Americas. But walk these streets today and what you find is life — musicians playing pagode on street corners, artists selling paintings from doorways, the smell of acarajé frying in giant pots, children kicking soccer balls across triangular plazas.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Watching a capoeira roda in Largo do Pelourinho. Two performers moved in the center of a circle, their bodies flowing between dance and combat — kicks spinning inches from faces, hands touching the ground in cartwheels that defied physics. Around them, musicians played berimbau, atabaque drums, and pandeiro, singing call-and-response in Portuguese and Yoruba. This wasn't a show for tourists. This was cultural memory made physical — a martial art disguised as dance so enslaved people could train without their captors knowing. Five hundred years later, it's still here, still defiant, still beautiful.
          </div>

          <p>Salvador has over 300 churches, but if you see only one, make it the Church of São Francisco. The exterior is restrained Portuguese baroque. The interior is an explosion of gold leaf — every surface carved, gilded, painted with such detail you could spend hours reading the stories told in wood and precious metal. It's overwhelming, almost hallucinatory. The wealth that built this came from sugar and slavery, a fact the church doesn't hide. Beauty and brutality, wrapped together in ways Salvador forces you to hold in your mind at once.</p>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pelourinho Historic District</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage Site — the colonial heart of Salvador with colorful Portuguese architecture, cobblestone streets, triangular plazas, live music, and capoeira performances. Largo do Pelourinho features the city museum and Casa Jorge Amado (famous Brazilian author). Free to wander. 3-4 hours minimum to absorb the atmosphere. Wear comfortable shoes for hills and cobblestones.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Church of São Francisco</h4>
          <p>Portuguese baroque masterpiece with interior covered in intricate gold leaf — one of Brazil's most opulent churches. Every surface tells a story in carved, gilded wood. Adjacent Igreja da Ordem Terceira features stunning facade. Entry ~R$15 ($3). 1 hour. Modest dress required. Photography restricted inside. The visual overwhelm is intentional and extraordinary.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Rosário dos Pretos</h4>
          <p>"Church of the Black Rosary" built by enslaved Africans over 92 years (1704-1796), constructed during their few free hours. Simple exterior, powerful history. Interior honors African heritage alongside Catholic tradition. Free entry (donations welcome). 30 minutes. The story this building tells is essential to understanding Salvador.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Elevador Lacerda</h4>
          <p>Iconic Art Deco elevator connecting Lower and Upper cities since 1873 (current structure from 1930). 72-meter ascent in 30 seconds, panoramic views of All Saints Bay. Fare ~R$0.15 (pennies). Operates every few minutes. This is how you arrive in Pelourinho — emerging from the elevator into the plaza above is pure theater.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mercado Modelo</h4>
          <p>Historic market near cruise terminal with 250+ shops selling handmade crafts, lace, musical instruments, religious items, artwork. Afro-Brazilian culture on full display. Capoeira demonstrations. Upstairs restaurants serve Bahian food. Free entry. 1-2 hours. Bargaining expected. Walking distance from ship.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Forte de Santo Antônio da Barra</h4>
          <p>Bahia's oldest fort (1583) housing South America's oldest lighthouse. Now Nautical Museum with Portuguese colonization artifacts. Views of All Saints Bay and city. Entry ~R$15 ($3). 1 hour. Located at Barra Beach neighborhood. Combine with beach time if schedule allows.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Capoeira Roda</h4>
          <p>Afro-Brazilian martial art combining dance, acrobatics, and music. Free performances in Pelourinho plazas (especially Largo do Pelourinho). Tuesday Night Street Parties (Terça da Benção) feature drums, dancing, food. Participating schools also offer quick intro lessons (~R$50). The music and movement are hypnotic — this is cultural resistance made art.</p>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Mercado Modelo walkable from terminal. Pelourinho requires uphill walk or Elevador Lacerda. Historic center itself is walkable but hilly with cobblestones.</li>
            <li><strong>Elevador Lacerda:</strong> The classic way to reach Upper City from terminal area — 30-second ride for ~R$0.15. Operates frequently during daylight hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at terminal; negotiate or insist on meter. Expect ~R$20-30 to Pelourinho. Uber operates in Salvador and often more reliable.</li>
            <li><strong>Organized Tours:</strong> Ship excursions cover Pelourinho, churches, and cultural sites with guides and transportation. Independent touring very doable for confident travelers.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Note:</strong> Stay in tourist areas (Pelourinho, Barra). Keep valuables secure. Don't display expensive jewelry/cameras unnecessarily. Salvador is generally safe in tourist zones but use normal city caution.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Acarajé:</strong> The iconic Bahian street food — black-eyed pea fritters split and filled with vatapá (shrimp paste), caruru (okra), and dried shrimp. Fried in dendê (palm oil). Sold by Baianas in traditional white dress. Spicy, rich, unforgettable.</li>
            <li><strong>Moqueca Baiana:</strong> Fish or seafood stew cooked in clay pot with coconut milk, dendê oil, tomatoes, onions, peppers. Served with rice and farofa (toasted cassava flour). Lighter than it sounds, deeply flavorful.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocada:</strong> Sweet coconut candy — white or black (with rapadura/brown sugar). Sold in markets and by street vendors. Simple, sweet, addictive.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Tropical Fruits:</strong> Mangoes, passion fruit (maracujá), cashew fruit, açaí. Juice stands everywhere offer fresh blends.</li>
            <li><strong>Cachaça:</strong> Brazilian sugarcane spirit — base of caipirinha cocktail. Local brands worth trying. Sip straight or in traditional lime cocktail.</li>
            <li><strong>Bahian Buffet (Comida a Kilo):</strong> Pay-by-weight restaurants offer chance to sample multiple dishes — moqueca, feijoada, vatapá, bobó de camarão. Budget-friendly way to explore cuisine.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Take the Elevador Lacerda up to Pelourinho at least once — the 30-second ride and dramatic arrival is quintessential Salvador.</li>
            <li>Tuesday evenings in Pelourinho feature Terça da Benção street parties (if ship stays late) — drums, dancing, food, music. Free cultural immersion.</li>
            <li>Churches require modest dress (covered shoulders/knees). Bring light scarf or wear pants if planning church visits.</li>
            <li>Portuguese phrasebook helpful — "Obrigado/a" (thank you), "Quanto custa?" (how much?), "Onde fica...?" (where is...?).</li>
            <li>Acarajé vendors cluster in Pelourinho and near Elevador Lacerda — look for Baianas in traditional white clothing. Point to what you want; ask "picante?" (spicy?) if concerned about heat.</li>
            <li>São Francisco Church photography is restricted inside — absorb it with your eyes. The gold leaf in person is worth more than any photo.</li>
            <li>Capoeira performances in plazas are free but performers appreciate tips. R$5-10 is generous and supports cultural tradition.</li>
            <li>Mercado Modelo vendors expect bargaining — offer 60-70% of asking price and negotiate up. Good-natured haggling is part of the experience.</li>
            <li>ATMs inside Mercado Modelo and in Pelourinho. Bring some cash for small purchases, street food, tips.</li>
          </ul>
