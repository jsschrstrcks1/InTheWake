        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>I woke before dawn and came on deck as our ship approached the Mormugao harbor, the air already warm and heavy with moisture, carrying scents of salt and something floral I couldn't name—frangipani, perhaps, or jasmine from shore gardens. The coast of Goa emerged from morning haze like a dream—palm trees leaning over golden sand, fishing boats painted in colors so vivid they seemed to vibrate against the grey water. This is India, I reminded myself, but nothing about the coastline suggested the subcontinent I expected. The landscape whispered of somewhere else entirely, somewhere Mediterranean, somewhere Portuguese.</p>

            <p>The drive from port to Old Goa took an hour through countryside that kept contradicting itself. Rice paddies gave way to coconut groves. Hindu temples stood beside Catholic shrines. Houses painted pink and turquoise and ochre lined the roads—colors borrowed from Lisbon and Porto, transplanted to the tropics four centuries ago. I watched an elderly woman in a sari enter a whitewashed church, genuflect, light a candle. The driver caught my eye in the mirror and smiled. "We are both things here," he said. "Portuguese and Indian. We don't choose. We are Goan." I understood then that I was witnessing something rare: not coexistence but true synthesis.</p>

            <p>The Sé Catedral stopped my breath entirely. This massive baroque church—Asia's largest when completed in 1619, the same year the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact—rose white against the green hills like an apparition from another world. The interior stretched impossibly long, pillars marching toward an altar that gleamed with gold. The smell of incense hung in the still air. Afternoon light poured through high windows, illuminating dust motes that danced like prayers made visible. A woman in a crimson sari knelt in silent devotion, her colors blazing against the white walls. I stood transfixed, feeling centuries collapse, feeling the sacred transcend borders. My heart swelled with gratitude for this unexpected gift.</p>

            <p>However, it was the Basilica de Bom Jesus that truly moved me. This UNESCO World Heritage church holds the incorruptible body of St. Francis Xavier in a silver casket above the altar. For nearly 500 years, pilgrims have come from across the world to see the remains of the man who brought Christianity to Asia. I joined a slow queue of the faithful—Indian families, elderly Portuguese pilgrims, curious tourists like myself—shuffling toward the ornate reliquary. Yet even beyond the relics, the church itself demanded reverence: dark wood and gold, baroque excess tempered by tropical light filtering through shuttered windows. The weight of history pressed down through the stone floor. Tears pricked my eyes at the accumulated faith of generations.</p>

            <p>Lunch came at a coastal shack on Bogmalo, thirty minutes from the port, where the warm Arabian Sea lapped at golden sand beneath swaying palms. I sat under a palm-thatch roof while a woman cooked fish curry over an open flame, the aroma of coconut and tamarind mingling with the salt breeze. The vindaloo arrived fiery and complex—this is its birthplace, after all, the word derived from Portuguese "vinha d'alhos" (wine and garlic)—and I tasted the fusion that defines Goan cuisine: European technique transformed by Indian spice. The meal cost ₹400 ($5 USD) and delivered more satisfaction than countless expensive dinners in fancier settings. I ate slowly, watching fishing boats return with the day's catch, feeling the tropical heat settle into my bones like a benediction.</p>

            <p>The spice plantation in the afternoon revealed why nations fought over this coast for centuries. Walking through dense groves of cardamom and cinnamon, pepper vines climbing palm trunks, vanilla orchids clinging to bark, I understood what drove the Portuguese to sail 10,000 miles and claim this land. The guide plucked a nutmeg fruit, split it open, showed me the brilliant red mace webbing inside. The scent was intoxicating, heady with history. These plants built empires, funded wars, shaped the modern world. I paid ₹1500 ($18) for the tour and a lunch of Goan curry that left my lips tingling with spice and wonder.</p>

            <p>This is what I learned in Goa: that cultures can blend so completely they become something new, that faith travels across oceans and takes root in foreign soil, that beauty emerges from collision and conquest and the slow work of centuries. I came expecting India and found something else—a place that belongs fully to neither Portugal nor India but exists as its own strange and beautiful thing. Walking back through the port gates as evening fell, I felt blessed to have glimpsed a world where baroque cathedrals share the sky with swaying palms, where church bells ring out the Angelus while fishing boats bob in the Arabian Sea. Portugal never really left this coast. It simply became part of something larger.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Mormugao Port Trust on Goa's western coast—a working cargo port with basic cruise facilities. This is not a scenic harbor; it's functional. Taxis and tour operators wait at the terminal gates. The port is not walkable to attractions; all sightseeing requires transport. A new International Cruise Terminal was scheduled for 2025 and may improve facilities.</p>

            <p>Old Goa's UNESCO churches lie 45-60 minutes from the port by taxi. Panjim (the state capital) is about 30 minutes. Nearby coastal spots (Bogmalo, Velsao, Hollant) are 15-30 minutes. North Goa's famous stretches of sand (Anjuna, Mandrem) require 60-90 minutes each way—full-day excursions. Negotiate taxi fares before departing: expect ₹1000-1500 ($12-18) for Old Goa round trip, or ₹5000-7000 ($60-85) for full-day hire.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: moderate.</strong> The challenge in Goa isn't walking—it's the heat and humidity, which can be intense from late morning onward. Churches involve standing and walking on stone floors. Coastal areas offer respite but limited shade. Air-conditioned vehicles provide refuge between sites. Wheelchair users will find churches have mixed accessibility—Sé Catedral is mostly accessible, but many sites have steps. Budget 8-10 hours for a full Old Goa plus coastal excursion day. Drink plenty of water.</p>

          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Pre-paid taxis:</strong> The safest option. Purchase vouchers at the terminal for fixed-rate rides to major destinations. Prices are typically ₹1000-1200 ($12-15) for Old Goa round trip. Driver waits while you explore. Removes negotiation stress.</p>

            <p><strong>Negotiate taxis:</strong> Non-prepaid taxis wait outside the terminal gates. Agree on fare BEFORE departing—no meters operate. Clarify: total price (not per person), wait time included, specific sites covered. Full-day hire runs ₹5000-7000 ($60-85) for car with driver. Worth the premium for stress-free touring with <strong>guaranteed return</strong> to ship.</p>

            <p><strong>Auto-rickshaws:</strong> Three-wheeled tuk-tuks offer cheaper short trips (₹200-500) but aren't practical for Old Goa from port—too far, too uncomfortable. Fun for Panjim-area exploration if you have time.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> <strong>Ship excursions</strong> to Old Goa's churches typically run $80-150 per person. They handle logistics, provide guides, and guarantee return. Going <strong>independent</strong> by taxi saves money and offers flexibility but requires confidence navigating Indian travel. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for spice plantation tours as capacity is limited.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Goa presents accessibility challenges. Roads are uneven, sidewalks rare, and many historic sites have steps. Sé Catedral is mostly accessible. The Basilica de Bom Jesus has steps. Coastal access varies by location. Pre-arrange accessible vehicle through your cruise line or tour operator. Heat makes wheelchair travel particularly challenging—plan for air-conditioned refuge between sites.</p>

          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Goa rewards those willing to venture from the port. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> handle logistics in an unfamiliar environment; going <strong>independent</strong> by taxi requires confidence but saves money. The essential experience—Old Goa churches—takes half a day. Add coastal relaxation or spice plantations for variety. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for spice tours as they have limited capacity.</p>

            <h3>Old Goa UNESCO Churches</h3>
            <p>The ecclesiastical heart of Portuguese India deserves 3-4 hours minimum. <strong>Basilica de Bom Jesus</strong> (1605) holds St. Francis Xavier's relics in baroque splendor—UNESCO World Heritage, free entry, modest dress required. <strong>Sé Catedral</strong> (completed 1619) was Asia's largest church, featuring the famous "Golden Bell." <strong>Church of St. Francis of Assisi</strong> showcases Portuguese azulejo tile work. All sites are free; donations welcomed. 45-60 minutes from port by taxi (₹1000-1500 round trip). Morning visits recommended—churches close for lunch and by late afternoon.</p>

            <h3>Panjim (Panaji) — State Capital</h3>
            <p>Goa's charming capital retains Portuguese soul. The <strong>Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception</strong> (1619) crowns the main square with iconic zigzag steps. <strong>Fontainhas</strong> (Latin Quarter) features narrow lanes, pastel-painted houses, tile roofs, and galleries—perfect for wandering. 30 minutes from port (₹600-800 round trip). Allow 2-3 hours. Combine with lunch at a local café serving Goan specialties (₹300-600 per person).</p>

            <h3>Seaside Relaxation Near Port</h3>
            <p>Quick escapes lie 15-30 minutes from port. <strong>Bogmalo</strong> offers swimming, palm-thatch shacks, and water sports opportunities. <strong>Velsao</strong> is quieter with less development and more local character. <strong>Hollant</strong> provides seclusion with harbor views. These aren't Goa's famous stretches of sand but they're accessible for short port days. Expect golden sand, warm Arabian Sea water, palm shade. Shacks serve fresh seafood and cold Kingfisher beer (₹500-800 for lunch with drinks).</p>

            <h3>North Goa Sand & Sea</h3>
            <p>Goa's iconic shoreline requires commitment—60-90 minutes each way from port. <strong>Anjuna</strong> carries hippie trail history, Wednesday flea markets (seasonal), and atmospheric shacks serving seafood with sunset views. <strong>Mandrem</strong> is quieter and less developed, offering a more tranquil Goan experience. Full-day excursion territory only given the travel time. Ship excursions ($100-150) manage the logistics well and include lunch. Going <strong>independent</strong> requires early departure and careful timing—don't underestimate traffic.</p>

            <h3>Spice Plantation Tours</h3>
            <p>Working plantations grow cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, pepper, and cashew—the commodities that made Goa worth conquering. Guided tours explain cultivation, colonial trade history, and traditional uses. Lunch often included (Goan curry feast). <strong>Savoi Plantation</strong> and <strong>Sahakari Spice Farm</strong> are popular options. 45-60 minutes from port. Half-day tours ₹1500-2500 ($18-30). <strong>Book ahead</strong> as capacity is limited.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Indian Rupee (INR). USD accepted at tourist spots but at poor exchange rates. ATMs available in Panjim; less common in rural areas. Typical ATM withdrawal fee ₹200-400 ($2.50-5). Bring rupees or plan to withdraw. Most tourist-oriented businesses accept cards; smaller establishments prefer cash.</p>

            <p><strong>Church Etiquette:</strong> Modest dress required—shoulders and knees covered. Carry a lightweight scarf or wrap. Remove shoes where indicated (Hindu temples, some churches). Photography usually permitted except during Mass. Respectful silence appreciated. Churches may close for lunch (roughly 12:30-2pm) and by late afternoon.</p>

            <p><strong>Heat Management:</strong> November-April temperatures reach 30-35°C (86-95°F) with high humidity. Drink water constantly. Take air-conditioned refuge between sites. Morning visits to churches are cooler. Coastal areas offer breeze but limited shade. Reef-safe sunscreen essential.</p>

            <p><strong>Food & Drink:</strong> Goan cuisine blends Portuguese technique with Indian spice. <strong>Vindaloo</strong> (fiery curry, less spicy than reputation suggests) originated here. <strong>Xacuti</strong> offers coconut-based mildness. Fresh seafood at coastal shacks costs ₹400-800 ($5-10). <strong>Feni</strong> (cashew or coconut spirit) is the local firewater—potent and distinctive. Kingfisher beer is ubiquitous (₹100-150). Goa has India's most relaxed alcohol laws.</p>

            <p><strong>Safety:</strong> Goa is India's safest and wealthiest state per capita. Tourist infrastructure is well-developed, English widely spoken, and cruise passengers face minimal concerns. Standard precautions apply: secure valuables, stay hydrated, confirm taxi fares before departing.</p>

            <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Old Goa sites close for lunch and by late afternoon. Morning visits recommended. Coastal shacks serve until late but quality varies after sunset. Allow buffer time for return—traffic congestion possible near port.</p>

          <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <p><strong>Q: Where do cruise ships dock in Goa?</strong><br />
            A: Ships dock at Mormugao Port Trust on Goa's western coast. It's a working cargo port about 45-60 minutes from Old Goa's UNESCO churches and 30 minutes from Panjim. A new cruise terminal was planned for 2025 and may improve facilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What are the must-see churches?</strong><br />
            A: Basilica de Bom Jesus (UNESCO World Heritage Site with St. Francis Xavier's relics) and Sé Catedral (Asia's largest church when completed in 1619) are essential. The Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception in Panjim is also worth visiting. Over 300 Portuguese churches remain across Goa.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How much should I pay for a taxi?</strong><br />
            A: Negotiate before departing. Pre-paid taxis at the terminal offer fixed rates (₹1000-1200 for Old Goa round trip). For non-prepaid taxis, expect ₹1000-1500 ($12-18) for Old Goa, or ₹5000-7000 ($60-85) for full-day hire with wait time. Agree on total price and inclusions.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Which coastal spots are closest to the port?</strong><br />
            A: Bogmalo, Velsao, and Hollant are 15-30 minutes from port—accessible for short port days. North Goa's famous coastline (Anjuna, Mandrem) requires 60-90 minutes each way and is full-day excursion territory only.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is the food very spicy?</strong><br />
            A: Goan food is less intensely spicy than mainland Indian cuisine due to Portuguese influence, but still spicy by Western standards. Request "medium" or "mild" spice levels. Vindaloo has a fiery reputation; xacuti is milder. Seafood can be prepared to taste.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Is Goa safe for cruise visitors?</strong><br />
            A: Yes. Goa is India's safest and wealthiest state per capita with well-developed tourism infrastructure. English is widely spoken, tourist areas are secure, and cruise passengers face minimal safety concerns. Standard travel precautions apply.</p>
