# Invocation Header — v3.006

This module reproduces the full “In the Wake — Frontend Standards v3.002 (Changelog)” without alteration.
It remains canonical for frontend behavior (absolute-URL normalizer, service-worker guard, floating share-bar, and accessibility utilities).

v3.006 adds only:
- Hidden HTML invocation comment requirement (see 00-core/HIDDEN_INVOCATION_COMMENT.html)
- Structured-data compliance for share metadata (OG/Twitter alignment)
- JSON-LD compliance for ItemList.position and itemReviewed schema validation

All other rules remain intact. No text or semantics were changed.
