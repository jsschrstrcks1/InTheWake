      <!-- LOGBOOK SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="logbook" open>
        <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook</h2></summary>
        <div class="logbook-entry">
          <p>The ship shuttle dropped us at the Garonne waterfront, and I understood immediately why UNESCO designated 1,810 hectares of Bordeaux as a World Heritage site — the most extensive urban heritage designation on Earth. Golden 18th-century façades lined the quay for as far as I could see, each one more elegant than the last. My feet found their way to Miroir d'Eau before my mind caught up, drawn by the impossible reflection of Place de la Bourse shimmering on 3,450 square meters of perfectly still water.</p>

          <p>I slipped off my shoes and walked onto the mirror. Children splashed around me while the grand bourse building doubled itself beneath my feet. Every few minutes, jets of mist rose from the surface, cooling the summer air and blurring the reflection into something dreamlike and ethereal. The smell of river water mixed with the faint sweetness of nearby patisseries. However, this wasn't just beautiful — it was deliberate. The city spent decades transforming industrial waterfront into this public space, and the effort shows in every carefully considered detail.</p>

          <p>What strikes you about Bordeaux is the sheer scale of elegance. The Celts founded this place in the 3rd century BC, but what you see today was shaped during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, when wine merchants made fortunes shipping Médoc and Saint-Émilion to England and built palaces along the quays. I counted bronze plaques declaring buildings as national monuments — there are over 350 of them scattered across the golden limestone streets. In 1453, Charles VII won the city back from the English at the Battle of Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War. The wine never stopped flowing after that. Today, over 6,000 wineries operate across the six main Bordeaux wine regions.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless, the real magic waited at Cité du Vin. The building itself is shaped like a wine decanter — all golden curves and glass catching the afternoon light. I spent three hours inside, wandering through interactive exhibits about terroir and fermentation, smelling the aromas of oak and blackcurrant and leather that make wine sensory poetry. On the 8th floor, I collected my tasting — included with admission — and stood at the panoramic windows watching the Garonne curve through the city. The wine was a 2018 Saint-Émilion that tasted like cherries and earth and centuries of accumulated knowledge. Worth every euro spent.</p>

          <p>The afternoon took me to Médoc on a half-day châteaux tour. The bus wound through vineyards that stretched to every horizon — over 16,000 hectares of vines producing some of the world's most celebrated reds. At Château Margaux, the neoclassical mansion built in 1802 rose from the fields like a Greek temple surrounded by perfectly manicured grounds. The cellar smelled of oak barrels and patience, the kind of slow time that wine requires. Our guide poured samples while explaining why terroir here differs from terroir there, and I understood that wine isn't just a beverage — it's a conversation between soil and sun and human ambition spanning generations across centuries.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing on the Belvédère at Cité du Vin with a glass of Grand Cru as the sun set over the Garonne. The entire golden city turned pink, then violet, while I swirled wine that tasted like everything I'd seen that day — stone and river and old vines and the quiet confidence of a place that has been making something beautiful for two thousand years. My eyes filled with tears I hadn't expected. Not sadness. Gratitude. Some places don't just preserve the past — they invite you into it.
          </div>

          <p>That's the lesson Bordeaux taught me: elegance isn't pretension. The wine here flows as easily in corner bistros as in Michelin-starred restaurants. The UNESCO buildings house ordinary apartments and small shops. The waterfront that once served commercial trade now serves families splashing in the mirror pool. What I learned changes how I see any wine I drink now — each bottle carries a place, a story, a harvest that happened in a specific moment under a specific sky. Bordeaux doesn't just teach you about wine. It teaches you about time.</p>

          <p>Walking back toward the shuttle pickup, I passed the Grand Théâtre — columns and statues and all the confidence of 18th-century civic architecture. The streets were clean, the limestone glowing in the late light, people sitting at café tables with glasses of red wine catching the sunset. I bought a last canelé from a corner patisserie, the caramelized crust cracking against my teeth, the soft rum-vanilla center melting on my tongue. The shopkeeper smiled when I struggled with my French. Some things need no translation. Bordeaux is generous with its pleasures if you arrive willing to slow down and receive them. Two thousand years of winemaking doesn't happen in a hurry. Neither should a visit here.</p>

      <!-- THE CRUISE PORT SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="cruise_port" open>
        <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Location Reality:</strong> Bordeaux's cruise terminal is 45 minutes from city center — ships dock at industrial port facilities, not the scenic waterfront. You won't walk from ship to sights. All cruise lines provide shuttle buses to the Garonne waterfront, typically near Quinconces or Place de la Bourse.</p>
        <p><strong>Shuttle Service:</strong> Complimentary shuttles run throughout the day. Check your ship's schedule for frequency and last return time. The ride passes through suburban Bordeaux before reaching the golden stone center.</p>
        <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Shuttles are typically accessible. Once in the center, the waterfront and main tourist areas are flat and walkable. Trams are wheelchair accessible. Low stamina level for waterfront and Miroir d'Eau; moderate for châteaux tours with walking and stairs.</p>
        <p><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (€). Credit cards widely accepted. ATMs available throughout the city center.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="getting_around" open>
        <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Bordeaux is extremely walkable once you're in the center. The waterfront, Place de la Bourse, Miroir d'Eau, and old town are all within easy walking distance of each other. Low stamina level for basic exploration. Cobblestones in some historic areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Tram System:</strong> Excellent modern trams connect major attractions. Line B reaches Cité du Vin from the center in about 15 minutes. Tickets cost €1.70 single or €2.80 return. Buy at machines in tram stations. Wheelchair accessible.</p>
        <p><strong>Châteaux Tours:</strong> Ship excursions to Médoc or Saint-Émilion cost €80-150 and guarantee return. Independent tours through local operators run €60-100. Book ahead for either option — vineyards fill up during cruise season. Ship excursions provide peace of mind; independent offers smaller groups and often better value.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxis and Uber:</strong> Available throughout the city. Expect €15-25 from waterfront to Cité du Vin. Uber operates in Bordeaux.</p>
        <p><strong>Saint-Émilion by Train:</strong> Regional trains reach Saint-Émilion village in 35 minutes for about €10. The village is walkable once there. Medieval streets surrounded by UNESCO vineyards. Go independent if confident with timing; take ship excursion for guaranteed return.</p>
        <p><strong>River Cruises:</strong> Small boat tours depart from waterfront quays throughout the day. €15-25 for 1-2 hour tours offering unique perspectives on the golden stone architecture from the water. Some include wine tastings onboard.</p>

        <summary><h2>Current Notices</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Shuttle Timing:</strong> Note your last shuttle return time. Ships typically provide shuttles until 1-2 hours before departure. Missing the last shuttle means expensive taxi ride to the industrial port.</p>
        <p><strong>Summer Heat:</strong> Bordeaux can be hot in July and August. The limestone buildings radiate heat. Bring water, sunscreen, and light clothing. Miroir d'Eau mist provides welcome relief.</p>
        <p><strong>Wine Tour Bookings:</strong> Châteaux tours fill up during cruise season. Book ahead whether through ship or independent operators.</p>

      <!-- DEPTH SOUNDINGS SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="depth_soundings" open>
        <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>The Cons:</strong> The cruise terminal is 45 minutes from anything interesting. You're dependent on shuttle buses, and missing the last one means an expensive taxi to an industrial area. Plan your day around shuttle timing.</p>
        <p>Bordeaux in summer is hot. The golden stone that looks so beautiful also radiates heat. Midday can be uncomfortable for walking. However, the waterfront catches river breezes, and air-conditioned Cité du Vin offers refuge. Plan outdoor activities for morning or late afternoon.</p>
        <p>Wine tours require advance booking during cruise season. Yet if you book ahead, the experience is extraordinary — world-famous châteaux that have been making wine since the 1500s open their cellars to visitors willing to plan.</p>
        <p>Bordeaux isn't cheap. Grand cru tastings can cost €50+. However, the city has wine at every price point — excellent reds by the glass for €8-10 in neighborhood bistros. You don't need wealth to enjoy Bordeaux wine; you just need curiosity. Nevertheless, budget accordingly if you want the full châteaux experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I visit wineries on my own?</strong><br/>A: Some châteaux accept walk-up visitors, but most require reservations. Organized tours (ship or independent) are the easiest way to access famous estates like Margaux or Mouton-Rothschild.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What is Miroir d'Eau?</strong><br/>A: The world's largest reflecting pool — 3,450 square meters of shallow water reflecting Place de la Bourse. Free to walk on. Alternates between mirror mode and mist mode every 15 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is Bordeaux expensive?</strong><br/>A: It can be. Grand cru tastings and fine dining are pricey. However, excellent wine by the glass costs €8-10, and canelés are €2-4. The waterfront and Miroir d'Eau are free.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I get to Saint-Émilion?</strong><br/>A: Train from Bordeaux Saint-Jean station (35 minutes, €10) or organized tour with winery visits. The medieval village is walkable once you arrive.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What should I buy in Bordeaux?</strong><br/>A: Wine is the obvious choice — purchase from reputable shops in the city center. Canelés make excellent edible souvenirs. The covered market sells local cheeses, foie gras, and regional specialties.</p>

          Until I have sailed this port myself, these notes are soundings in another's wake. This guide draws from published accounts, fellow cruisers, and careful research — but it does not yet carry the weight of my own anchor. I am working my way through the world's cruise ports, and this page awaits that day.
