      "markdown": "**Statendam proved S-Class possible. Maasdam proved it could improve.**\n\n[Maasdam](/ships/holland-america-line/maasdam.html) arrived in 1993 as the second S-Class ship, incorporating refinements from Statendam's early months. The differences were subtle but meaningful—improved flow, refined details, lessons learned.\n\nShe served Holland America for nearly three decades, longer than some passengers' entire cruising careers. Maasdam was there when they discovered cruising, and there when they celebrated milestone voyages.\n\nThe S-Class proportions aged gracefully. Even near retirement, Maasdam felt right—not dated, just classic.\n\n**The longevity:** Maasdam demonstrated what good design achieves. The sister ship that served and served.\n\nThose who sailed Maasdam across decades remember her evolution. The ship that aged into elegance.",

      "markdown": "**The Caribbean from Maasdam felt different from the mega-ships that followed.**\n\n[Maasdam](/ships/holland-america-line/maasdam.html) sailed Caribbean itineraries at S-Class scale—about 1,266 passengers rather than thousands. Ports absorbed us gracefully. Beaches never felt invaded. The Caribbean remained Caribbean.\n\nReturn to ship brought HAL's classic programming. The main dining room served beautifully. The entertainment satisfied without overwhelming. The experience complemented tropical simplicity.\n\nWe could walk St. Thomas without dodging mega-ship crowds. We could snorkel without competition. The Caribbean Maasdam showed us still existed.\n\n**The approach:** Maasdam delivered Caribbean properly. The intimate scale that beaches deserve.\n\nThose who found Caribbean through Maasdam remember the balance. Paradise without overcrowding.",

Her final sailings drew passengers who'd loved her for years—returning to say farewell to a ship that had meant so much.\n\nThe crew understood the sentiment. The atmosphere mixed celebration with melancholy. We photographed spaces we'd come to love. We memorized views we'd soon lose access to.\n\nS-Class ships have all departed now. Maasdam was among the last. An era ended when she sailed away.\n\n**The goodbye:** Maasdam's farewell voyages honored what she'd meant. The ship that earned emotional departure.\n\nThose who sailed Maasdam's final season remember the feeling. The goodbye that mattered.",
