          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The sun hit us like a welcome slap the moment we stepped off the gangway. Fortaleza earns its nickname—"Sunshine Capital"—honestly, with over 2,800 hours of sun annually drenching this city of 2.7 million in relentless golden light. The taxi driver grinned when I asked for Praia do Futuro, said "Thursday—lagosta day" in heavily accented English, and we rattled through streets where palm trees swayed and salsa poured from open windows. The smell of the sea mixed with grilled meat and something sweet—cashew, I'd later learn, since Ceará is Brazil's cashew heartland.</p>

            <p>Praia do Futuro stretched before us like a postcard that had somehow come to life. Wide golden sand, turquoise Atlantic water, and dozens of barracas—those wonderful Brazilian institutions that are part beach club, part restaurant, part second home. We chose one with palm-thatch umbrellas and plastic chairs planted right in the sand, ordered cold Skol beer and agua de coco hacked fresh from coconuts, and watched the beach come alive. Families arrived in waves, grandmothers setting up camp under umbrellas while children charged the surf. Musicians tuned instruments on a small stage. The waiter said lagosta would be ready in an hour.</p>

            <p>When the lobster arrived, I understood why people make the pilgrimage. A whole grilled lobster, split and butterflied, still sizzling from the grill, dripping butter onto a plate crowded with rice, beans, farofa, and vinaigrette. The price—equivalent to maybe sixteen American dollars—seemed impossible. Back home, this would cost five times as much. I cracked the shell, pulled out meat so fresh it almost tasted alive, and felt something loosen in my chest. This wasn't a tourist experience carefully packaged for consumption. This was Fortaleza being itself, and somehow we had been welcomed to the table.</p>

            <p>My wife noticed the jangadas first. Those traditional wooden sailing rafts—essentially logs lashed together with a triangular sail—have carried fishermen into Atlantic waters for three hundred years. We watched one crew haul their jangada onto the beach, their catch already sold before they landed. The wood gleamed wet in the afternoon light, salt-weathered and worn smooth by countless hands over countless years. A weathered fisherman saw us staring and gestured toward the boat, miming an invitation. We climbed aboard, felt the rough wood under our bare feet, saw the simple rigging that has survived unchanged while the world modernized around it. The sound of water lapping against the hull mixed with distant forró music from the barracas.</p>

            <p>He said something in Portuguese we couldn't understand, but his smile needed no translation. Pride. This was his inheritance, passed down through generations. He showed us the sail, the tiller, the way the logs were lashed together with techniques that predate written records. His hands moved over the craft with the intimate familiarity of someone who had spent decades learning its secrets. When he helped us climb back down to the sand, he pressed a small seashell into my wife's palm—a gift offered without words, requiring none. We stood there as his crew prepared to launch again for the evening catch, watching the triangular sail catch the offshore breeze.</p>

            <p>The forró band started playing as the sun dropped toward the horizon. That accordion-driven music that sounds like celebration even when the lyrics are sad, that makes your feet move even when you're determined to stay in your chair. An elderly couple danced in the sand, their movements precise and practiced from decades of partnership—a lifetime of love visible in every synchronized step. My wife took my hand. We danced too, badly, laughing at ourselves and at the strangeness of finding ourselves here, on this beach at the edge of Brazil, surrounded by a language we didn't speak but somehow understanding everything that mattered. The sun painted the Atlantic copper and gold and the lobster lingered on our tongues. For a moment I felt tears prick my eyes—not sadness but something closer to gratitude for these random gifts that travel hands you when you least expect them. The children were still chasing waves. The fishermen were launching for the evening catch. And we were exactly where we needed to be.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> That fisherman's smile as he showed us his jangada. He had nothing to sell us, no angle, no tourist pitch. He simply wanted to share his pride in a craft that has survived three centuries because it works, because it carries his family's traditions, because some things deserve to continue. My heart swelled looking at that simple wooden boat. I thought about what endures and what fades, and felt blessed to have glimpsed something real. Fortaleza gave us sun and lobster and music, but that fisherman's smile—that was the gift I carried home.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Porto do Mucuripe cruise terminal, approximately 6km east of the city center in the port district. The terminal has basic facilities—restrooms, small shops, taxi stand—but nothing elaborate. Ships dock directly at the pier (no tendering required). Taxis queue at the terminal, and Uber works well in Fortaleza for transparent pricing. The beach district of Meireles is about 10 minutes away, while Praia do Futuro (the best beach) is 15-20 minutes.</p>

            <p>Currency is Brazilian Real (BRL). Current exchange rate is approximately $1 USD = 5 BRL. Credit cards are accepted at tourist establishments and barracas, but cash is useful for smaller vendors and tips. ATMs are widely available in the city but not at the beach—bring cash for your beach day. Fortaleza is remarkably affordable by cruise standards. A full lobster meal with drinks runs approximately R$120-180 ($25-35 USD) per person. Taxi from port to Praia do Futuro costs approximately R$30-40 ($6-8 USD).</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low to moderate.</strong> Beach visits require minimal exertion—you can park yourself at a barraca all day with food and drinks brought to you. Beach Park involves walking and climbing waterslide towers (moderate stamina required). The historic center involves moderate walking on urban streets. Wheelchair access is limited at beaches; barracas have sand approaches. Beach Park has some accessible facilities. Language barrier is real—Portuguese is essential for meaningful interaction, though tourist areas have some English. Basic Portuguese phrases go a long way.</p>

          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis and Uber:</strong> The practical options for cruise visitors. Uber works well and provides transparent pricing—download the app before arrival. Official taxis queue at the terminal; negotiate fares before departing. To Praia do Futuro: R$30-40 ($6-8 USD). To Beach Park: R$80-120 ($16-24 USD) each way. Keep car doors locked in traffic as a general precaution.</p>

            <p><strong>Ship excursions:</strong> Offer <strong>guaranteed return</strong> and handle logistics, particularly valuable for Beach Park where transport costs add up. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($80-150) typically include entrance and transport. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Beach Park packages if you want hassle-free experience. For Praia do Futuro, <strong>independent</strong> travel via taxi/Uber is easy and much cheaper.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Limited utility for cruise visitors. The port area itself is industrial and not walkable to attractions. Once at Praia do Futuro, everything clusters along the beach—barracas, vendors, entertainment. The historic center is walkable once you arrive by taxi, with the main attractions within a few blocks of each other. Sidewalks can be uneven; bring sturdy walking shoes.</p>

            <p><strong>Beach Park logistics:</strong> Located 30-40 minutes north in Porto das Dunas. Taxi costs R$80-120 each way (not cheap for solo travelers). <strong>Ship excursions</strong> often work out cheaper when you factor in transport. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for entrance tickets online at beachpark.com.br for small discount. Plan to spend half-day minimum (5-6 hours typical). Return taxi can be arranged through the park.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Limited infrastructure overall. Beaches have sand approaches that challenge wheelchairs. Barracas are rustic with uneven surfaces. Beach Park has some accessible facilities—inquire when booking. Taxis accommodate wheelchairs with advance notice. The historic center has better paved surfaces but cobblestones in some areas. Generally, Fortaleza requires planning for mobility-impaired visitors.</p>

            <p>Fortaleza offers two distinct paths: beach relaxation with authentic Brazilian culture, or waterpark thrills at Beach Park. Most cruise calls (8-10 hours) allow time for one major experience. <strong>Independent</strong> travel works well for Praia do Futuro; <strong>ship excursions</strong> make sense for Beach Park when you factor transport costs. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for Beach Park to guarantee entrance during peak times.</p>

            <h3>Praia do Futuro Beach Day</h3>
            <p>Fortaleza's best beach, 15-20 minutes from port. Wide golden sand, clean Atlantic water, excellent barraca infrastructure with loungers, umbrellas, showers, bathrooms, and fresh seafood. Choose a barraca and commit for the day—they provide services in exchange for food/drink orders (R$30-50 minimum per person courteous). Thursday is traditional lobster day with biggest crowds and freshest catch. Grilled whole lobster R$80-120 ($16-25 USD). <strong>Independent</strong> travel via taxi/Uber straightforward and cheap. Low stamina—beach relaxation. Allow 4-6 hours. Bring sunscreen, cash, and swimwear worn under clothes.</p>

            <h3>Beach Park Waterpark</h3>
            <p>One of Latin America's largest waterparks, 30-40 minutes north in Porto das Dunas. The legendary Insano slide is 41 meters tall with near-vertical descent reaching 105 km/h. Dozens of slides, lazy rivers, wave pools, and beach access. World-class facility. Entrance approximately R$280-350 ($55-70 USD). <strong>Ship excursions</strong> ($100-150) include transport and often work out cheaper than independent taxis. <strong>Book ahead</strong> at beachpark.com.br for small discount. Moderate stamina—walking and climbing required. Allow half-day minimum (5-6 hours). Food available inside but pricey. Worth it for waterpark enthusiasts, especially families.</p>

            <h3>Centro Histórico (Historic Center)</h3>
            <p>Colonial heart around Praça do Ferreira. Catedral Metropolitana is a modernist marvel seating 5,000. Theatro José de Alencar showcases Art Nouveau architecture. Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Assunção is the 1649 Dutch fort that gave the city its name. Mercado Central offers handicrafts, cashews, hammocks, lace. Taxi from port R$25-35 ($5-7 USD). <strong>Independent</strong> visit easy. Museum entry approximately R$10 ($2 USD). Low to moderate stamina—urban walking. Allow 3-4 hours. Morning visits cooler. Good alternative if weather turns cloudy.</p>

            <h3>Jangada Sailing Experience</h3>
            <p>Traditional wooden sailing raft rides at Praia do Futuro or Mucuripe beach. Local fishermen take small groups for 30-60 minute sails along the coast. Experience a craft used for three centuries. Not luxurious—you sit on logs or rough benches—but authentic and memorable. Approximately R$50-100 ($10-20 USD) per person. <strong>Independent</strong> booking at beach barracas. Best morning or late afternoon when wind is steady. Low stamina but requires boarding rough craft. Not for mobility-impaired visitors. Expect to get wet.</p>

            <h3>Dragão do Mar Cultural Center</h3>
            <p>Modern complex near Praia de Iracema with museums, theaters, planetarium, and cafes. Museum of Ceará Culture showcases regional traditions. Contemporary Art Museum has rotating exhibitions. Air-conditioned respite from heat. Museum entry R$10-20 ($2-4 USD). Walking distance from Iracema beach, 15 minutes from port by taxi. <strong>Independent</strong> visit straightforward. Low stamina. Allow 2-3 hours. Good option if seeking indoor activities or rain alternative.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>Thursday lobster tradition:</strong> Ceará's coastline provides prime lobster fishing territory, and Fortaleza has developed Thursday as the traditional lobster day at Praia do Futuro barracas. The custom dates back decades when fishermen returned mid-week with the freshest catch. Now it's a beloved local ritual—families, friends, and visitors gather at barracas to feast on grilled lobster at prices that seem impossible to outsiders. A whole lobster for $16-25 USD buys what would cost $80-100 in North America. The quality is extraordinary because the supply chain is short: boat to barraca to grill to plate.</p>

            <p><strong>Jangada legacy:</strong> These traditional wooden sailing rafts represent three centuries of Northeastern Brazilian fishing tradition. Essentially logs lashed together with a triangular sail, jangadas seem impossibly primitive yet prove ideally suited for their purpose. They're cheap to build, nimble in shallow water, and carry generations of accumulated knowledge. UNESCO has recognized jangada building as cultural patrimony. The craft survive not as museum pieces but as working boats, still launching from Fortaleza's beaches daily. Watching a jangada crew at work connects you to maritime traditions that predate modern Brazil.</p>

            <p><strong>Cashew capital:</strong> Ceará is Brazil's cashew heartland, and Fortaleza offers the chance to experience the fruit in all its forms. Most people only know the nut, but the cashew apple—that strange, pear-shaped fruit to which the nut attaches—is eaten fresh, juiced, or fermented. The flavor is astringent and acidic, an acquired taste, but refreshing chilled. Cajuína is clarified cashew juice, amber-colored and slightly sweet. Mercado Central sells roasted, raw, and candied cashews at prices far below what you'd pay at home. Buy some for the ship—they make excellent late-night snacks.</p>

            <p><strong>Barraca customs:</strong> These beach club establishments follow unwritten rules worth knowing. Choose one barraca and stay—hopping between them is considered poor form since they provide services (loungers, umbrellas, bathrooms, showers) in exchange for food and drink purchases. Minimum consumption of R$30-50 per person is the unspoken expectation. Waiters remember orders without writing anything down. Tipping is appreciated but not obligatory—round up or leave 10%. The barraca becomes your home base for the day, a distinctly Brazilian approach to beach life that feels like joining an extended family gathering.</p>
