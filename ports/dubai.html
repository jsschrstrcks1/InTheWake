          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The Burj Khalifa appeared first as a needle threading through morning haze, impossibly thin and impossibly tall, growing more improbable with each mile our ship sailed toward port. By the time we docked at Mina Rashid, the world's tallest building had company—an entire skyline of glass and steel towers that hadn't existed when I was born, built on sand and ambition and oil wealth transformed into vertical statements of what humans can accomplish when money meets imagination. My wife and I stood at the rail taking it in, caught between admiration for the engineering and unease about what it all meant. Dubai demands that response. It won't let you remain neutral.</p>

            <p>We took a taxi from the terminal through streets so clean they looked pressure-washed hourly, past construction cranes that seemed to outnumber birds, and arrived at Dubai Mall—not because we wanted to buy anything but because the Burj Khalifa observation deck lives there. The scale of the place defied comprehension. An aquarium large enough to house whale sharks occupied one wall. An indoor waterfall cascaded past diving sculptures. Perfume from luxury stores mixed with the scent of a thousand food stalls until the air itself felt expensive. I felt overwhelmed before we even found the elevator to the 124th floor, my senses saturated by the deliberate excess of it all.</p>

            <p>But then we rose. The At the Top observation deck delivered exactly what I hadn't dared to expect—views that stretched to the curve of the Earth, the Palm Jumeirah floating like a fantasy island in the Persian Gulf, container ships reduced to toys in the harbor. Standing 555 meters above the desert floor, I felt genuinely small in a way that brought unexpected comfort. The city's ambition suddenly seemed less oppressive from up here, more like the natural expression of a people determined to matter, to be seen, to leave something behind. My wife squeezed my hand. We stayed longer than planned, watching the afternoon light shift across a landscape that didn't exist sixty years ago.</p>

            <p>The Gold Souk provided antidote to the mall's sterile perfection. We took the metro to Al Ras station, then walked through narrow covered passages where gold gleamed from every window—tons of it, enough to ransom kingdoms, displayed with casual abundance that felt almost reckless. The air smelled of spices from the neighboring Spice Souk, warm and earthy and old, the kind of smell that predates air conditioning and survives despite it. Merchants called out greetings. A tea seller pressed cups into our hands. For the first time all day, I felt the human texture beneath the gleaming surface—the traders who had worked this creek for generations before oil changed everything, still selling, still bargaining, still living the rhythm their grandparents knew.</p>

            <p>An abra cost one dirham—about thirty cents—to cross Dubai Creek from Deira to Bur Dubai. We crowded onto the wooden boat with locals heading home, the city's towers reflecting in water that had carried traders since before Dubai had a name. The diesel engine chugged. Warm wind carried sounds of the creek—dhows unloading cargo, car horns from the corniche, call to prayer from a nearby mosque drifting over the water. In those five minutes, floating between old Dubai and new, I felt something shift in my understanding of this place. It wasn't just excess and ambition. It was also continuity, the ancient human enterprise of buying and selling and moving goods, dressed now in glass and steel but rooted in the same sand where pearl divers once launched boats.</p>

            <p>We ended in Al Fahidi, the preserved historic quarter, walking through narrow lanes between wind-tower houses restored with care and imagination. Art galleries occupied old courtyards. A coffeehouse served cardamom-laced drinks in the shade of walls built when Dubai was a fishing village. My wife found a small antique shop where the owner—Syrian, decades in Dubai—told stories of the city's transformation while we sipped tea he refused to let us pay for. Tears surprised me as we walked back toward the creek. Not sadness—recognition of something profound. This man had found refuge here, built a life, raised children who called Dubai home. The city of excess was also a city of immigrants, strivers, dreamers from everywhere, building something together even if I couldn't quite define what.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Crossing the creek at sunset on that one-dirham abra, dhows silhouetted against glass towers, the call to prayer floating over water that had carried boats for a thousand years. Looking back, Dubai taught me that old and new don't have to be enemies, that ambition can be rooted even when it reaches impossibly high, and that somewhere in the space between pearl divers and observation decks, there's a city worth understanding if you look past the headlines about artificial islands and indoor ski slopes.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Ships dock at Mina Rashid Cruise Terminal (Port Rashid), one of the world's most modern cruise facilities with six dedicated berths and capacity for the largest vessels afloat. Located in Bur Dubai near the historic creek, the terminal places you between old Dubai and new—the Gold Souk and Al Fahidi quarter within taxi reach, the Burj Khalifa and modern downtown fifteen minutes by car. Terminal facilities include air-conditioned waiting areas, duty-free options, currency exchange, and direct taxi queues. Taxis are plentiful, metered, and fair; Uber operates throughout Dubai.</p>

            <p>The city sprawls across the desert, so strategic planning matters. Key distances from the terminal: Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall (15-20 minutes by taxi), Gold Souk (10 minutes), Palm Jumeirah (30 minutes), Dubai Marina (30-35 minutes). The Dubai Metro provides excellent connections once you reach a station—Union station serves the old town, Burj Khalifa station the downtown core—but reaching the metro from the port requires a taxi first. Currency is UAE Dirham (AED); credit cards accepted virtually everywhere. November through April offers pleasant weather; summer heat makes outdoor exploration extremely difficult.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: varies by activity.</strong> Indoor attractions (Dubai Mall, observation decks, malls) work for all fitness levels—extensive air conditioning makes heat irrelevant inside. Souk exploration requires moderate walking on uneven surfaces with limited air conditioning; low to moderate stamina. Desert safaris involve vehicle-based touring with manageable walking; moderate stamina. Beach time requires heat tolerance. Wheelchair users find modern Dubai highly accessible with excellent infrastructure, elevators, and adapted facilities; older areas like the souks present significant challenges with uneven floors and crowded passages.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Taxis:</strong> The most practical option for cruise visitors. Metered, air-conditioned, and widely available at the terminal and throughout the city. Expect to pay 30-50 AED ($8-14) from port to Burj Khalifa area, 40-60 AED ($11-16) to Dubai Marina, 15-25 AED ($4-7) to Gold Souk. Taxis accept cash and cards. Uber operates throughout Dubai and often offers better rates than street taxis.</p>

            <p><strong>Dubai Metro:</strong> Clean, modern, air-conditioned, and remarkably affordable (3-8 AED per ride depending on zones). Red line connects major attractions including Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall station. However, no metro station serves the cruise terminal directly—you'll need a taxi to Union station (old town) or any other entry point. Metro cards (Nol cards) available at stations; single-journey tickets also sold. Women-and-children cars available on each train. Operating hours 5am-midnight (later on weekends).</p>

            <p><strong>Abra water taxis:</strong> Crossing Dubai Creek costs just 1 AED (about $0.27)—the cheapest and most atmospheric transport in the city. Wooden boats run constantly between Deira and Bur Dubai stations on the creek. No schedule; boats depart when full (usually within minutes). Perfect for reaching the Gold Souk from the old town side. A quintessential Dubai experience that predates everything modern.</p>

            <p><strong>Walking:</strong> Feasible within specific zones—Dubai Mall complex, Al Fahidi district, souk areas—but not between them. Distances are vast; summer heat makes outdoor walking genuinely dangerous. Pedestrian infrastructure excellent in modern areas, limited in old town. Always carry water during cooler months; avoid outdoor walking entirely in summer.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Modern Dubai offers excellent wheelchair access—malls, metros, observation decks all fully adapted with elevators and accessible facilities. The cruise terminal provides wheelchair assistance. Older areas (souks, Al Fahidi) present significant barriers: uneven surfaces, narrow passages, limited ramps. Beach areas accessible at some resorts. Desert safari vehicles cannot accommodate standard wheelchairs. Contact venues in advance for specific needs.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Dubai rewards both <strong>ship excursion</strong> booking and <strong>independent</strong> exploration. Ship tours guarantee <strong>guaranteed return</strong> timing and often include skip-the-line access at attractions—valuable for Burj Khalifa during peak season. <strong>Book ahead</strong> online for popular sites: At the Top observation deck sells out days in advance, especially for sunset times. Independent visitors can see more for less but must manage timing carefully given distances.</p>

            <h3>Burj Khalifa At the Top</h3>
            <p>World's tallest building (828 meters, 163 floors) offers observation decks at levels 124-125 (At the Top, 555m) and 148 (At the Top SKY, 585m). The lower deck delivers extraordinary views at reasonable prices; the higher deck adds premium lounge and butler service. Sunset times most magical but hardest to book. Allow 2-3 hours including Dubai Mall transit and queuing. Book online at least 1-2 weeks ahead; walk-up tickets cost significantly more when available. At the Top costs 149-199 AED ($40-55) advance, 399 AED ($109) walk-up. SKY costs 379-533 AED ($103-145). Ship excursions ($90-150) bundle transport and skip-the-line access. Low stamina once inside—elevators do the work. Fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

            <h3>Gold Souk and Spice Souk</h3>
            <p>The Gold Souk in Deira houses hundreds of shops displaying tons of gold jewelry in covered passageways. Prices depend on daily gold rates plus workmanship; bargaining expected and welcomed. The adjacent Spice Souk offers saffron, frankincense, dried fruits, and Persian specialties. Best visited morning or evening when heat is manageable. Take metro to Al Ras station or taxi from terminal (15 AED). Allow 2-3 hours to explore both souks. Free to wander; purchases your choice. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration ideal. Moderate stamina—extensive walking on uneven surfaces. Limited accessibility; wheelchair users will struggle with crowds and surfaces.</p>

            <h3>Al Fahidi Historic Quarter</h3>
            <p>Restored 19th-century neighborhood of wind-tower houses converted to galleries, coffeehouses, and small museums. The most intimate glimpse of Dubai before oil. Dubai Museum occupies Al Fahidi Fort (oldest building in Dubai, 1787). Narrow lanes perfect for wandering; cafes offer respite with views of wooden architecture. Walking distance from the abra station (Bur Dubai side). Allow 2 hours. Museum admission 3 AED ($0.80). <strong>Independent</strong> exploration works perfectly. Low to moderate stamina—flat but uneven surfaces. Limited accessibility in narrow lanes; Dubai Museum has steps.</p>

            <h3>Palm Jumeirah</h3>
            <p>The artificial archipelago shaped like a palm tree hosts luxury resorts, restaurants, and the famous Atlantis hotel. Non-guests can visit Atlantis aquarium (The Lost Chambers, 130 AED / $35), dine at celebrity chef restaurants, or simply drive the frond for the experience. The Palm Jumeirah Monorail connects to the mainland and offers views. Beach access at several hotels for fees ($50-100). Allow half-day minimum. Ship excursions ($70-120) combine Palm with other stops. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for restaurant reservations and aquarium during peak season. Low to moderate stamina depending on activities. Generally accessible; some beaches have adapted facilities.</p>

            <h3>Desert Safari</h3>
            <p>Half-day excursions (usually 3pm-9pm) include dune bashing in 4x4 vehicles, camel rides, sunset views, belly dancing, and BBQ dinner under stars at desert camps. The classic Dubai experience beyond the urban core. Ship excursions ($100-180) guarantee timing; <strong>independent</strong> operators offer similar experiences ($50-100) with less timing certainty. <strong>Book ahead</strong> required. Allow 6-8 hours. Not recommended for pregnant women, those with back problems, or young children. Moderate stamina. Standard vehicles not wheelchair accessible; specialized safaris available by advance arrangement.</p>

            <h3>Dubai Aquarium</h3>
            <p>Located in Dubai Mall, the aquarium houses 33,000+ animals in a massive viewing tank. The base experience (viewing tunnel) costs 169 AED ($46); packages add behind-the-scenes tours, shark encounters, and glass-bottom boat rides ($70-150). Combine with Burj Khalifa for a full day at Dubai Mall. Easy <strong>independent</strong> access; ship excursions often bundle both attractions. Allow 1-2 hours. Low stamina. Fully wheelchair accessible.</p>

          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>From pearls to petroleum:</strong> Dubai Creek served as a pearl-diving and trading center for centuries before oil was discovered in 1966. The ruling Maktoum family invested petroleum revenues into infrastructure, tourism, and financial services, deliberately diversifying before the oil ran out. Today petroleum accounts for less than 5% of Dubai's economy—a transformation achieved in a single generation through strategic vision and foreign investment.</p>

            <p><strong>The Burj Khalifa:</strong> Construction took six years (2004-2010) and employed over 12,000 workers at peak. The 828-meter tower uses a bundled tube design to resist wind forces; the Y-shaped footprint provides stability. Its spire adds 200+ meters to the structural height. The building holds records for highest occupied floor, longest elevator travel, and highest outdoor observation deck. Maintenance requires permanent window-washing units; cleaning the entire exterior takes 3-4 months.</p>

            <p><strong>Palm Jumeirah engineering:</strong> Built between 2001-2008, the artificial island required 120 million cubic meters of sand and rock, enough to fill the Empire State Building 2,000 times. No concrete was used for the base—just dredged sand shaped by GPS-guided barges. The outer crescent breakwater protects against waves. Controversy surrounds environmental impacts on marine life and sediment patterns, though developers claim the island now supports new coral ecosystems.</p>

            <p><strong>Expatriate city:</strong> Only 15% of Dubai's population are Emirati citizens; the remaining 85% are expatriates from India, Pakistan, Philippines, Bangladesh, and worldwide. This demographic reality shapes daily life—restaurants serve cuisines from every continent, English serves as common language, and the city's labor force builds the very towers that define the skyline. Conversations about workers' rights and living conditions remain ongoing and complex.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is Dubai expensive for cruise passengers?</summary>
              <p>Dubai offers options across all budgets. The metro is affordable (under $2 per ride), souks offer genuine bargains, and food courts provide reasonable meals. High-end attractions (Burj Khalifa, Atlantis, celebrity restaurants) can be expensive but aren't required. Taxis are metered and fair. Budget travelers can enjoy Dubai; it just requires planning.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do I need to cover up in Dubai?</summary>
              <p>Modest dress (shoulders and knees covered) is appropriate in souks, older neighborhoods, and public spaces. Malls and modern areas are more relaxed. Swimwear is fine at beaches and hotel pools only. During Ramadan, extra modesty and respect for fasting are expected. The dress code is cultural courtesy rather than strict law in tourist areas.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Should I book the Burj Khalifa in advance?</summary>
              <p>Yes—observation deck tickets sell out, especially sunset times. Book online at least 1-2 weeks ahead for popular times. Walk-up tickets cost significantly more when available. Ship excursions often include skip-the-line access. Don't leave this to chance; the experience is worth planning for.</p>

          <p class="author-note"><em>These soundings in another's wake reflect one family's experience. Dubai resists easy judgment—excess and ambition and genuine hospitality all mixed together in a city that didn't exist sixty years ago. The abra crossing at sunset, call to prayer drifting over ancient creek with modern towers watching, taught me that new and old can coexist when people decide they will.</em></p>

          <p>Modern megacity of superlatives: world's tallest building, artificial islands, vast malls. But also ancient trading souks and creek crossings by wooden boat. Ship excursions help manage distances; metro efficient once you reach it.</p>
