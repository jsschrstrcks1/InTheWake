      <h3>Adventure Dunes Review: Fun Family Activity with Ocean Views</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> Mini golf at sea is one of those quintessential cruise activities that's easy to overlook but surprisingly enjoyable. Adventure Dunes provided our family with a fun competitive outing on sea days, and the ocean backdrop makes it a unique experience you can't get at your local putt-putt course.</p>

      <h4>The Course</h4>
      <p>The 9-hole course features creative obstacles including bridges, tunnels, and themed elements. While not as elaborate as a shore-side mini golf attraction, it's well-maintained and offers enough variety to be engaging. The artificial turf plays consistently, and most holes are achievable for players of all skill levels. A few challenging holes keep it interesting for adults while remaining accessible for kids.</p>

      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>We played twice during our cruise—once on a sea day morning (moderate wait of about 10 minutes) and once late afternoon (no wait). The views are the real highlight: putting while surrounded by ocean on a beautiful day is genuinely special. Our kids (ages 7 and 10) loved it and asked to return multiple times. The staff was friendly and efficient with equipment distribution.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Adventure Dunes is a pleasant complimentary activity that's perfect for filling time between other activities or shows. Don't expect a world-class mini golf experience, but do expect a fun, family-friendly outing with unbeatable views. <strong>Rating: 4.0/5.</strong> Recommended for families and anyone who enjoys casual outdoor activities.</p>
