In Athens, I climbed the Acropolis he'd described countless times. In Rome, I touched stones his words had brought alive.\n\nThe ancient world comforted grief differently than modern places.

The Parthenon didn't care about my tears; it had seen worse for twenty-five centuries.\n\n'He would have loved this,' I whispered at Delphi.\n\nBut he had loved it\u2014through books, through teaching, through years of preparation.
