She took Century's innovations and refined them. The lessons from a year of operations informed every enhancement.\n\nThe Orion Restaurant built on Grand Restaurant's success. The spa expanded what Century introduced. Galaxy wasn't just sister ship—she was improved sister ship.\n\nFor two decades, Galaxy represented Celebrity excellence. The Alaska sailings that became legendary. The Mediterranean voyages attracting repeat passengers. The ship that proved Century Class could sustain.\n\n**The truth:** Galaxy refined Century's revolution. Her departure from the fleet removed a ship that proved the concept could endure.\n\nThose who sailed Galaxy remember her as Century's accomplished sibling.
