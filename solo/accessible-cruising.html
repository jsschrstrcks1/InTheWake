        <p class="dek" itemprop="description">Five psychological principles for wheelchair users, chronic illness, autism, deaf travelers, and all disabled cruisers—from preparation to belonging.</p>
      </header>

      <div itemprop="articleBody">

<p>Cruising can be one of the most freeing ways to see the world—steady decks, predictable routines, familiar staff, and a floating home gently carrying you from port to port. But for travelers with disabilities of any kind—mobility, sensory, developmental, chronic illness, or invisible conditions—freedom doesn't just happen. It grows from preparation, clarity, and confidence.</p>

<p>These five principles apply across nearly every disability and every cruise line. Whether you use a wheelchair, navigate autism, travel while deaf or hard of hearing, or live with a condition others never see—these truths remain steady beneath your feet.</p>

<hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid var(--foam);margin:2rem 0">

<h2 id="principle-1">1. Know YOUR Specific Needs — Not the Generic Word "Accessible"</h2>

<p>Cruise lines love the word "accessible."<br>
Travelers quickly learn it can mean almost anything.</p>

<p>What matters is not the label, but the fit.</p>

<p>Ask yourself early:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I need to function comfortably?</li>
<li>Where do I struggle most on land?</li>
<li>What absolutely must be in place for this to be a good trip?</li>
<li>What can I compromise on, and what can I not?</li>
</ul>

<p>"Accessible stateroom" may not mean a power-operated door.<br>
"Quiet dining" may still have background noise.<br>
"Assistance available" may mean help—just not at the moment you expect it.</p>

<p>Naming your real needs gives you power.<br>
It lets the crew understand you, equips you to ask clearly, and protects you from disappointment.<br>
This isn't selfish. It's stewardship of your own wellbeing.</p>

<hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid var(--foam);margin:2rem 0">

<h2 id="principle-2">2. Advocate Early… and Specifically</h2>

<p>Cruise lines handle thousands of guests. Specificity cuts through the noise.</p>

<p>Good advocacy looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I need a roll-in shower, not just grab bars."</li>
<li>"I need a table with minimal foot traffic due to sensory overwhelm."</li>
<li>"I need communication to be written rather than verbal."</li>
<li>"I need help transferring into a tender at X port."</li>
<li>"I need a place to lie down mid-day due to fatigue."</li>
</ul>

<p>Advocating early isn't being difficult.<br>
It's giving the ship time to prepare—so you're not scrambling once onboard.</p>

<p>Clarity is kindness: to yourself, and to the people trying to help you.</p>

<h3 id="booking-cabin">Booking the Right Cabin: Timing and Details Matter</h3>

<p>Accessible staterooms are limited—usually 2-4 per ship, sometimes fewer.<br>
First come, first served.<br>
If you wait too long, they're gone.</p>

<p><strong>Book 6-12 months ahead</strong> if you can, especially for popular sailings or holidays.</p>

<p>But "accessible" isn't one thing.<br>
Cruise lines typically offer two categories:</p>

<p><strong>Wheelchair Accessible:</strong><br>
Roll-in shower, wider doorways (usually 32+ inches), grab bars, lower counters, visual doorbells/alarms, and enough turning radius for a manual or power chair.</p>

<p><strong>Ambulatory Accessible:</strong><br>
Grab bars in the bathroom, sometimes a tub with a seat, but narrower doors and tighter spaces. This works if you walk with difficulty but don't use a full-time mobility device.</p>

<p>Know which one you need. Ask specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exact door width?</li>
<li>Bed height (some are low, some are hospital-high)?</li>
<li>Distance from accessible cabin to elevators?</li>
<li>Balcony <a href="/accessibility.html">accessibility</a> (step? threshold height?)?</li>
<li>Connecting rooms available if traveling with a caregiver or family?</li>
</ul>

<p>Call the cruise line's <a href="/accessibility.html">accessibility</a> desk directly—not just a <a href="https://maulsbytravel.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel agent</a>.<br>
Write down the name of who you spoke with and the date.<br>
Get confirmations in writing via email.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">What Documentation You'll Actually Need</h3>

<p>Cruise lines don't require mountains of paperwork for most disabilities.<br>
But some situations do need documentation—and having it prevents problems later.</p>

<p><strong>Medications:</strong><br>
Bring prescriptions in their original containers.<br>
Carry a doctor's letter if you're bringing syringes, large quantities, or controlled substances.<br>
Keep them in your carry-on, not checked luggage.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Equipment:</strong><br>
If you're bringing a CPAP, oxygen concentrator, wheelchair, or scooter, notify the cruise line at booking.</p>

<p>For wheelchairs and scooters, they'll ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions (length, width, turning radius)</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Battery type (lithium batteries have restrictions—some ships limit size/wattage)</li>
<li>Charging needs (you may need to arrange accessible outlets in your cabin)</li>
</ul>

<p>For oxygen or respiratory equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most ships require pre-approval from their medical team</li>
<li>Some provide oxygen (for a fee); some require you to arrange delivery at ports</li>
<li>Bring equipment specs and your doctor's prescription</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Service Dogs:</strong><br>
Full section below—but briefly: vaccination records, certification, and relief area coordination.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong><br>
If you have a pre-existing condition, standard travel insurance may not cover cancellations or medical events.<br>
Look for policies that explicitly cover pre-existing conditions—and read the fine print about what "pre-existing" means to that company.</p>

<p>This isn't paranoia. It's preparation that leads to peace.</p>

<hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid var(--foam);margin:2rem 0">

<h2 id="principle-3">3. Independence With Support — Not Isolation, Not Over-Assistance</h2>

<p>You are allowed to ask for help.<br>
You are also allowed to decline it.</p>

<p>Healthy accessible travel holds these two things in tension:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dignity of independence</li>
<li>The freedom of receiving support when you choose it</li>
</ul>

<p>But independence doesn't mean fighting unnecessary battles.</p>

<p>Elevators, for example, are one of the hardest parts of ship life. People rush forward without realizing they've stepped in front of someone waiting in a wheelchair or scooter. Most aren't being unkind—they're excited, distracted, or simply unaware. But it still takes a toll.</p>

<p>This is where "independence with support" becomes essential. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a nearby passenger to hold space for you</li>
<li>Wait for the next elevator without guilt</li>
<li>Use aft or forward elevator banks that are often less crowded</li>
<li>Request a travel companion or crew member to assist during peak times</li>
</ul>

<p>And on boarding or in certain ports, many cruise lines offer embarkation and port assistance—trained staff who push you across the gangway, navigate the crowds, and often move you near the head of the line. It's not dependence; it's wise use of the help offered.</p>

<p>You get to choose where independence serves you and where support sustains you.</p>

<h3 id="onboard-life">Onboard Life: Dining, Entertainment, and Daily Rhythms</h3>

<p>Once you're aboard, accessible travel shifts from planning to living.<br>
And the daily rhythms of ship life have their own accommodations—some automatic, some worth requesting.</p>

<p><strong>Dining:</strong><br>
Main dining rooms usually have both booth seating and open tables.<br>
If you use a wheelchair, request table seating (booths don't work).<br>
If you have sensory needs, request a corner table or one away from high-traffic areas.<br>
If you have dietary restrictions, notify the dining team on embarkation day—they'll flag your table and work with you throughout the cruise.</p>

<p>Most ships also offer flexible dining, specialty restaurants, and room service.<br>
All are valid options if the <a href="/restaurants/mdr.html">main dining room</a> feels overwhelming.</p>

<p><strong>Theater and Entertainment:</strong><br>
Theaters have designated wheelchair spaces—usually along the sides or back.<br>
Arrive early on popular show nights; accessible seating is limited and first-come.<br>
If you're Deaf or hard of hearing, some ships offer captioned performances or assistive listening devices (ask Guest Services).</p>

<p><strong>Pools and Fitness:</strong><br>
Many newer ships have pool lifts for transferring from a wheelchair into the water.<br>
Not all do—call ahead and ask specifically.<br>
Some gyms have adaptive equipment; others don't. If fitness matters to you, research the ship's facilities before booking.</p>

<p><strong>Youth Programs:</strong><br>
If you're traveling with a child who has special needs—autism, ADHD, mobility challenges, medical conditions—notify the youth staff on embarkation day.<br>
Explain your child's needs, triggers, strengths, and communication style.<br>
Most counselors are willing to accommodate, but they can't read minds.<br>
Clear communication protects your child and sets everyone up for success.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Facilities:</strong><br>
Every ship has a medical center staffed 24/7.<br>
It's not a hospital—it's more like an urgent care clinic.<br>
They can handle minor injuries, illnesses, medication refills in emergencies, and stabilization for serious issues until you reach port.</p>

<p>If you have a complex chronic condition, know the ship's medical limitations and research hospitals in port cities before sailing.</p>

<div class="sunflower-callout">
<h3>The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Program (Optional Tool for Invisible Disabilities)</h3>

<p>Some disabilities can be seen at a glance. Others are carried quietly—autism, anxiety, chronic pain, brain injury, heart conditions, sensory processing disorders, or cognitive decline. For travelers who prefer a discreet way to signal that they may need patience or additional support, the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower program can be a helpful tool.</p>

<p>Royal Caribbean does not distribute sunflower lanyards on the ship.<br>
But they do recognize the symbol, and many of the ports and airports you'll pass through participate as well.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a lanyard before you travel, usually from a participating airport or port.</li>
<li>Wearing it quietly signals that you may need extra time, clearer communication, or a calmer approach.</li>
<li>Inform Royal Caribbean during booking so they can prepare accommodations if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is never required.<br>
It is simply one more way to travel with peace instead of pressure.</p>

<p>For some, the lanyard brings relief.<br>
For others, it's unnecessary.<br>
Both choices are valid.</p>
</div>

<hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid var(--foam);margin:2rem 0">

<h2 id="principle-4">4. Barriers Exist — Plan for Them Without Fear</h2>

<p>Even the best ships have limits, and naming them honestly doesn't diminish the joy of travel—it equips you to experience it with peace.</p>

<p>Common barriers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-drag carpeting that makes manual wheelchairs harder to push</li>
<li>Crowded elevators where people unintentionally surge ahead</li>
<li>Formal-night hallways packed with foot traffic and photo lines</li>
<li>Final-night luggage lining the corridors, turning movement into a slalom</li>
<li>Tenders that may not be wheelchair-safe</li>
<li>Noise levels that shift suddenly</li>
<li>Long pier distances in certain ports</li>
</ul>

<p>But for almost every barrier, there's a strategy or support option:</p>

<p><strong>High-drag carpet &amp; congested hallways:</strong></p>

<p>Plan for slower travel times. The carpeting feels great underfoot, but it's heavy resistance for wheels. This becomes most noticeable on formal nights when hallways are busy, and on the last night when luggage fills the corridors. If possible, let a companion help—or ask crew for assistance on longer stretches. Using the opposite side of the deck can also provide clearer pathways.</p>

<p><strong>Elevator congestion:</strong></p>

<p>Use forward or aft elevator banks. If someone cuts ahead, a gentle "There's a wheelchair waiting" is often enough to snap others back into awareness. Most people adjust instantly once they realize.</p>

<p><strong>Port accessibility:</strong></p>

<p>Many cruise ports offer wheelchair-accessible trams or shuttles that run the length of the pier. And most lines provide port assistance—crew who push wheelchairs down the gangway and guide you through the initial bottlenecks. This saves enormous physical and emotional energy.</p>

<p><strong>Long distances on shore:</strong></p>

<p>Some ports publish accessible maps; others offer accessible taxis or hired push-assist services. Planning these early turns potential frustration into smooth, predictable movement.</p>

<p>Recognizing barriers isn't pessimism.<br>
It's preparation—and preparation leads to peace.</p>

<h3 id="shore-excursions">Shore Excursions: When to Go, When to Stay</h3>

<p>This is where <a href="/accessibility.html">accessible cruising</a> gets complicated.</p>

<p>Cruise lines offer "accessible" shore excursions.<br>
But "accessible" varies wildly depending on the port, the tour operator, and the type of disability.</p>

<p><strong>Before booking any excursion, ask specific questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the bus/van wheelchair accessible? (Ramp? Lift? How wide is the aisle?)</li>
<li>Are there stairs at any stops? Cobblestones? Gravel paths?</li>
<li>How long is the walking portion? Flat terrain or hills?</li>
<li>Are bathrooms accessible along the route?</li>
<li>Can the tour accommodate sensory needs (quieter groups, breaks, flexibility)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't assume "accessible" means what you need.<br>
One traveler's accessible might be another traveler's impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Tendering Ports:</strong><br>
Some ports require "tendering"—taking a small boat from the ship to shore.<br>
Tendering often isn't wheelchair-accessible, especially in rough seas.<br>
The ship will usually notify you ahead of time if a port requires tendering and may advise you to stay aboard.<br>
This isn't failure. It's honest assessment of safety.</p>

<p><strong>Independent Exploration:</strong><br>
Some wheelchair users prefer to explore ports independently rather than book tours.<br>
This works well in accessible cities (Barcelona, <a href="/ports/sydney.html">Sydney</a>, Seattle).<br>
It's harder in older European cities with cobblestones and hills (<a href="/ports/santorini.html">Santorini</a>, Dubrovnik, Tallinn).</p>

<p>Research the port ahead of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the port publish accessibility maps?</li>
<li>Are there accessible taxis or rideshare services?</li>
<li>What's the distance from pier to town?</li>
<li>Are there wheelchair-friendly attractions nearby?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Staying Aboard:</strong><br>
Some of the best cruise days are spent on an empty ship while everyone else is ashore.<br>
Quiet pools. Open dining. Spacious decks. Rest.<br>
If a port isn't accessible or the excursion sounds exhausting—stay on the ship without guilt.<br>
You're not "wasting" the port. You're honoring your body's needs.</p>

<h3 id="specific-disabilities">Specific Disabilities, Specific Strategies</h3>

<p>Every disability brings its own challenges and rhythms.<br>
Here's what to know for the most common accessibility needs:</p>

<p><strong>Wheelchair Users:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Battery restrictions:</strong> Lithium-ion batteries over a certain wattage may not be allowed (check your cruise line's policy). Bring documentation showing battery type and wattage.</li>
<li><strong>Charging:</strong> Accessible cabins usually have outlets near the floor, but confirm ahead of time. Some travelers bring extension cords for flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Older ships:</strong> Vision and <a href="/ships.html#radiance-class">Radiance class</a> ships have narrower hallways and doorways than newer builds. Not impossible, but tighter. Oasis and newer classes are significantly more spacious.</li>
<li><strong>Theater and show seating:</strong> Wheelchair spaces are limited. Arrive early for popular performances.</li>
<li><strong>Tendering:</strong> Many tender boats aren't wheelchair-accessible. Expect to stay aboard at some ports.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deaf and Hard of Hearing:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Visual alerts:</strong> Accessible cabins have visual doorbells and phone alerts (flashing lights). Confirm this when booking.</li>
<li><strong>Captioned entertainment:</strong> Some ships offer captioned movies or assistive listening devices for shows. Ask Guest Services on embarkation day.</li>
<li><strong>Crew communication:</strong> Most crew members speak English, but accents and noise levels can make lipreading difficult. Carrying a small notepad or using your phone's text app helps.</li>
<li><strong>Port communication:</strong> Research whether your destination has accessible taxis or tour operators who understand Deaf communication needs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Autism and Neurodivergent Travelers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sensory-friendly spaces:</strong> The <a href="/restaurants/solarium-bistro.html">Solarium</a> (adults-only, quieter, glass-enclosed) and library are the calmest spots on most ships. Learn where they are on embarkation day.</li>
<li><strong>Routine maintenance:</strong> Ships thrive on routine—same dining times, same daily schedule. Use this to your advantage. Predictability reduces anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Overstimulation:</strong> Formal nights, sail-away parties, and embarkation/disembarkation days are the loudest, most chaotic. Plan for retreat time before and after.</li>
<li><strong>Youth programs:</strong> If your child is autistic, talk to the youth staff about sensory triggers, meltdown warning signs, and calming strategies. Bring comfort items from home.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chronic Illness (Cancer, Dialysis, Fatigue Conditions):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medical facilities:</strong> Ship medical centers can handle minor issues but aren't equipped for chemotherapy, dialysis, or complex chronic care. If you need ongoing treatment, research dialysis centers in port cities ahead of time.</li>
<li><strong>Energy management:</strong> Cruise days are long. Build in rest. You don't have to do every activity. Midday naps in your cabin aren't laziness—they're wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary needs:</strong> If you have specific nutritional requirements (low-sodium, diabetic-friendly, etc.), notify dining staff on day one. They'll work with you.</li>
<li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> Critical for chronic illness. Get coverage that includes medical evacuation if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Service Dogs:</strong></p>

<p>Service dogs are welcome on cruise ships, but preparation is key.</p>

<p><strong>Before you sail:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notify the cruise line at booking. They'll note your reservation.</li>
<li>Provide vaccination records and service dog certification.</li>
<li>Ask where relief areas are located on the ship (usually a designated deck area with artificial grass or gravel).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Onboard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relief areas are cleaned regularly, but you're responsible for cleanup after your dog.</li>
<li>Bring waste bags, cleaning supplies, and any food/medication your dog needs for the full voyage.</li>
<li>Some crew members may not be familiar with service dog etiquette—gentle education helps.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some countries have strict animal import laws. Your dog may not be allowed off the ship in certain ports (especially Caribbean islands and some Asian countries).</li>
<li>Research each port's regulations ahead of time to avoid surprises.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-wake">A Moment in My Own Wake</h3>

<p>Earlier this year I traveled with my dad shortly after his knee replacement. We'd been joking for weeks that the surgeon meant to give him the "Five-Million-Dollar Man" knee, but the good one was out of stock, so he ended up with the Dollar Tree version instead. Humor kept the mood light—but the truth was, he could walk, just not far, and embarkation looked daunting for both of us.</p>

<p>So we called ahead to arrange assistance.</p>

<p>The moment we arrived at the port, a crew member was already waiting—calm, prepared, and kind. They offered a wheelchair with no fuss or spotlight, then guided us through security and up the gangway at a pace that honored his comfort. Not once did they make him feel fragile. Not once did they make me feel like we were slowing anyone down.</p>

<p>No weird looks.<br>
No judgment.<br>
Just dignity and grace.</p>

<p>Within minutes my dad was onboard, settled, and smiling in a way I hadn't seen in months. It wasn't just the help—it was the way it was offered: quietly, naturally, as if caring for people in all stages of life is simply what you do.</p>

<p>That moment stays with me because it captures what accessible cruising can be at its best: not a spotlight on limitation, but a quiet honoring of humanity.</p>

<hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid var(--foam);margin:2rem 0">

<h2 id="principle-5">5. You Belong Here — Reject Every Trace of Ableism</h2>

<p>Some travelers feel like they're "in the way."<br>
Some shrink back when stares come.<br>
Some worry their needs are "too much."</p>

<p>Read this slowly:<br>
You belong here. We all do.<br>
From the autistic child overwhelmed by sound and motion,<br>
to the soldier still recovering from the harsh realities of their service,<br>
and everyone in between—<br>
you. belong. here. too.</p>

<p>Not because the ship is fulfilling a legal obligation,<br>
but because the sea was made to be enjoyed by all people.</p>

<p>Scripture says we're fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14)—all of us, in every body, with every limitation. Your mobility device is not an inconvenience. Your sensory needs are not a nuisance. Your chronic illness is not an imposition. Your limitations do not make you less of a traveler.</p>

<p>On a ship full of different bodies, different rhythms, and different challenges—you are not the odd one out. You are part of the tapestry of the voyage. Your presence adds depth, humanity, and compassion to the community onboard.</p>

<p>Ableism shrinks people.<br>
Dignity restores them.<br>
Choose dignity—every single time.</p>

<h3 id="what-didnt-work">What Didn't Work (Honest Talk)</h3>

<p>Accessible cruising isn't perfect.<br>
Even with preparation, some things fall short.</p>

<p><strong>Ships with poor accessibility:</strong><br>
Older ships (pre-2000s) weren't built with modern accessibility standards. Narrower hallways, fewer accessible cabins, older elevators. If accessibility is critical, book newer ships (<a href="/ships.html#oasis-class">Oasis class</a> and later).</p>

<p><strong>Excursions that promised access but failed:</strong><br>
Tour operators sometimes overstate accessibility. A "wheelchair-friendly" tour might have one surprise staircase or a gravel path that's impassable. Always ask detailed questions before booking—and be ready to advocate or request a refund if the reality doesn't match the promise.</p>

<p><strong>Crew gaps in disability awareness:</strong><br>
Most crew members are kind and willing. But not all understand invisible disabilities, neurodivergence, or chronic illness. You may need to educate as you go. This shouldn't be your job—but sometimes it is.</p>

<p><strong>When to advocate vs. when to accept limitations:</strong><br>
Some barriers are fixable with advocacy (a better table location, extra help at embarkation).<br>
Others are structural limits of the ship or port (no pool lift, tendering not wheelchair-accessible).<br>
Learning which is which saves energy and frustration.</p>

<p>Honest assessment doesn't diminish the joy of cruising.<br>
It protects you from unrealistic expectations and equips you to travel with eyes wide open.</p>

<h3 id="testimonials">What Worked: Real Stories from Accessible Travelers</h3>

<p>From the logbooks aboard ships we've followed, here are moments that mattered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wheelchair user who ice-danced</strong> (<a href="/ships/rcl/navigator-of-the-seas.html">Navigator of the Seas</a>):<br>
<em>"The rink staff didn't flinch when I asked if I could try. They brought me a sled, positioned my wheels at the edge, and helped me transfer. For ten minutes I glided across ice—free in a way my body hasn't been in years."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Autistic adult who sailed solo</strong> (<a href="/ships/rcl/grandeur-of-the-seas.html">Grandeur of the Seas</a>):<br>
<em>"The crew noticed my patterns and accommodated without asking. The <a href="/restaurants/windjammer.html">Windjammer</a> staff started preparing my usual breakfast before I arrived. The stateroom attendant learned I needed my cabin cleaned at exactly 2pm. Predictability = calm."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Post-stroke traveler finding strength</strong> (<a href="/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html">Brilliance of the Seas</a>):<br>
<em>"Physical therapy had been grueling, humiliating. But watching Alaska slide past through those massive glass panels, I wanted to walk. Not because doctors demanded it—because creation called me. By week's end, I walked the full promenade loop."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deaf family who felt included</strong> (<a href="/ships/rcl/navigator-of-the-seas.html">Navigator of the Seas</a>):<br>
<em>"For once, we weren't explaining ourselves constantly. The ship had visual alerts. The dining staff learned basic signs. Our kids played without communication being a barrier."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These aren't exceptions.<br>
They're what happens when preparation meets compassion.</p>

<h2 id="closing">In the Wake of Your Journey</h2>

<p>Accessible cruising isn't about pretending barriers don't exist.<br>
It's about naming reality honestly, preparing intentionally, and stepping aboard with confidence.</p>

<p>You have the right to rest.<br>
The right to joy.<br>
The right to experiences that nourish your soul.<br>
The right to inhabit the world—even the wide, blue world beyond the shoreline.</p>

<p>And as you sail, remember this:<br>
You don't have to do it alone.<br>
The ship has room for you.<br>
The journey has room for you.<br>
And the sea—wide and welcoming—has room for you too.</p>
