      "core_insight": "Radiance's glass-wall design creates an intimate, ocean-connected experience on a mid-sized ship",
      "markdown": "**The first thing you notice about Radiance is the glass.**\n\nFloor-to-ceiling windows line the promenades, glass elevators climb the outside of the ship, and even the [dining rooms](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) feel connected to the sea. It's a ship designed for travelers who want to watch the water, not just be on it.\n\nAt about 2,466 guests (double occupancy), Radiance feels mid-sized — big enough for variety, small enough that you won't get lost finding your cabin or the dining room. The layout is straightforward: decks stack vertically, no confusing neighborhood zones or hidden venues.\n\nIf you've sailed mega-ships like [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) or [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html), Radiance will feel intimate. If you're coming from smaller ships, it still offers [Royal Caribbean's](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) signature entertainment and dining variety without overwhelming you."

      "core_insight": "Radiance excels at ocean-forward design and straightforward navigation without overwhelming crowds",
      "markdown": "**Ocean-forward design.** The glass walls aren't just aesthetic — they make the ship feel open and connected to your surroundings. [Alaska sailings](/ports.html) especially benefit from this.\n\n**Mid-size navigation.** You can walk from bow to stern in a few minutes. Elevators are rarely crowded. The [Windjammer buffet](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card) has actual breathing room.\n\n**Classic Royal Caribbean reliability.** Main dining room, [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html), solid entertainment, familiar layout. If you've sailed [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) before, Radiance won't surprise you — but it won't disappoint either.\n\n**Global itineraries.** Radiance has sailed everywhere: Alaska, Caribbean, Australia, Asia. It's a ship built for repositioning cruises and longer voyages."

      "core_insight": "Radiance is a 2001 ship offering classic reliability over cutting-edge amenities — choose it for itinerary, not thrills",
      "markdown": "**This is a 2001 ship.** Radiance entered service before neighborhood layouts, FlowRider surf simulators, or robot bartenders. It's been refurbished, but don't expect cutting-edge tech or the newest venues.\n\n**Smaller dining variety.** You'll find the essentials ([main dining room](/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas.html#dining-card), Windjammer, [Chops Grille](/restaurants.html), specialty options), but not the 20+ venue spread of [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html) or [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html).\n\n**Quieter vibe.** Families sail Radiance, but the ship attracts more couples and [solo travelers](/solo.html) than kid-heavy mega-ships. Sea days feel calm, not chaotic.\n\n**Itinerary over amenities.** If you're choosing Radiance, you're probably choosing it for *where* it goes ([Alaska](/ports.html), Australia, unique ports) rather than onboard thrills."

      "core_insight": "Radiance suits travelers who prioritize scenic itineraries, quieter ships, and ocean views over mega-ship amenities",
      "markdown": "**You'll probably love Radiance if:**\n- You want panoramic ocean views and glass-wall design\n- You prefer [mid-sized ships](/ships.html) you can navigate easily\n- You're sailing scenic routes (Alaska, Australia, repositioning)\n- You value calm sea days over non-stop activities\n- You've sailed [Royal Caribbean](/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean.html) before and trust their reliability\n\n**You might prefer another ship if:**\n- You want cutting-edge tech and newest venues (try [Quantum](/ships/rcl/quantum-of-the-seas.html), [Oasis](/ships/rcl/oasis-of-the-seas.html), or [Icon class](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html))\n- You need [20+ dining options](/restaurants.html) and endless activities\n- You're traveling with kids who want waterslides and robot bartenders\n- You prefer neighborhood layouts to traditional deck stacking\n\n**The honest truth:** Radiance isn't flashy, but it's dependable. Pick it for where it goes and who it attracts — travelers who'd rather watch glaciers than surf simulators. See [sister ships](/ships/rcl/brilliance-of-the-seas.html) like Brilliance, [Serenade](/ships/rcl/serenade-of-the-seas.html), and [Jewel](/ships/rcl/jewel-of-the-seas.html) for similar vibes."
