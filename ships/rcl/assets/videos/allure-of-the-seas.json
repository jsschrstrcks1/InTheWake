LEARN MORE ABOUT STAR CLASS https://youtu.be/8cmZHX1MWpk  Royal Caribbean | Symphony of the Seas  It’s one of the world’s largest cruise ships, and it’s filled with family-friendly adventures to match.  What do you get when you combine one of the biggest ships in the world with some of the boldest thrills at sea? A gravity defying, status-quo denying, electrifying expedition onboard Symphony of the Seas that will set a new standard for family vacations. From first-at-sea feats to the favorites you know and love, you’ll find so many ways to make memories onboard.  BIG TIME THRILLS This is not your average family getaway — this is so much more. Loaded with thrills and unforgettable experiences for all ages, plus revolutionary spaces just for kids and plenty of date-night options for adults.  ULTIMATE ABYSS There's no turning back once you take the plunge 10 stories into the mysteries of the deep on the tallest slide at sea. No reservations required.  THE PERFECT STORM Grab a buddy and plunge down three stories of twisting, turning thrills to the bottom of the Typhoon℠, Cyclone℠ and Supercell℠ slides. The conditions are just right — for The Perfect Storm℠.  ZIP LINING Strap in and go for a ride nine decks above the Boardwalk® on the Zip Line. Don't look down.  TURN FAMILY TIME INTO ADVENTURE TIME Whether you’re traveling with toddlers, tweens or the whole extended adventure squad, you’ll never run out of things to do onboard Symphony of the Seas. From the mind-bending puzzle experience onboard, Escape the Rubicon, to the first-ever ten story plunge on the tallest slide at sea, Ultimate Abyss, there are so many onboard activities designed to ramp up your adrenaline and so many spaces to soak up the sunshine in between destinations and ports.   PLEASE YOUR PALATE When it comes to food on this ship, each course is cause for celebration. Whatever you’re in the mood for, a romantic date-night at 150 Central Park, or pint-sized snacks for little ones at Mini Bites, you’ll find something onboard to hit the spot.  YOUR TASTEBUDS WILL THANK YOU Pile your plate high with flavors as exciting as all the action onboard. We’re talking exotic Asian-inspired eats and sushi at Izumi. Tuscan favorites served family-style at Jamie’s Italian by Jamie Oliver. And dishes so far out of the box they’ll have you questioning reality at Wonderland Imaginative Cuisine.  IZUMI Say “Konnichiwa” to a reimagined favorite. Sushi, sashimi and more, all made-to-order with intense flavors, the best ingredients and impeccable presentation. Now that’s fresh.  JAMIE'S ITALIAN BY JAMIE OLIVER At Jamie's Italian by Jamie Oliver, you’ll enjoy Tuscan-inspired dishes like the crowd-pleasing Famous Plank and pastas made in-house — all crafted by one of Britain’s most famous chefs.  WONDERLAND Our Wonderland chefs twist their culinary kaleidoscopes, inventing elaborate dreamscapes of never-before-seen fare. The story begins as you \"brush\" the menu and find your element— Sun, Ice, Fire, Water, Earth and Dreams.  SWAGGED OUT SIPS This is not your average bar scene. On Symphony of the Seas every experience is elevated. Robots craft cocktails at the Bionic Bar, and wow-worthy views accompany each drink at the gently ascending Rising Tide Bar. If you’re pining for a pint, you’ll find all your favorite brews at the lively Boot & Bonnet Pub. It’s time to take that bar hop to the next level.",

AHH INSPIRING Emerge renewed, relaxed and rejuvenated at the Vitality Spa. Professional spa products from acclaimed brands such as Elemis, bliss, La Thérapie and Ionithermie bring the most advanced services to the sea. Massages, wraps, facials and acupuncture, or choose medi-spa treatments to smooth wrinkles, lift and tone.   SUN, SERENITY & SIPS Relaxation can be thirsty work. While you're soaking up the vibe at the adults-only Solarium, grab a refreshment from the Solarium Bar, where friendly bartenders serve wine, beer, cocktails and chilled tropical drinks perfect for sipping beneath your poolside umbrella.  RAISE THE BAR You could call it a wet elevator. It’s also the coolest way to move between Central Park and the Royal Promenade onboard all Oasis Class ships.
