        <h1>Hvar: Where Ancient Greeks Still Tend the Fields</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>They call Hvar the Queen of the Dalmatian Islands, and queens don't need to prove themselves. The island knows what it is — the sunniest place in Croatia, crowned with more UNESCO World Heritage sites than any other island on Earth, scented with the world's finest lavender, blessed with 2,724 hours of sunshine annually. When you step off the ship in Hvar Town, the Adriatic sparkles like someone scattered a million diamonds across turquoise silk, and the fortress on the hill watches over it all like it has for five centuries.</p>

          <p>The main square stops me every time. St. Stephen's Cathedral anchors one end with its Renaissance bell tower, cafés spill across Venetian marble that's been polished by footsteps since the 1400s, and palm trees sway like they're keeping time with centuries of conversations. This is where Europe's first public theater opened in 1612 — not in London or Paris, but here on this sun-blessed island where seafarers and nobles gathered to watch plays in a building that still stands today. Hvar has always understood that beauty and culture aren't luxuries; they're necessities.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing in Stari Grad Plain at golden hour, running my hand along a stone wall built by Greek colonists in 384 BC. Twenty-four centuries. The same walls that divided these fields when Plato was still teaching in Athens. The same crops — grapes, olives — that those Greeks planted, still growing, still harvested. I watched an elderly farmer tend vines that grew in soil worked by ancestors who spoke ancient Hellenic dialects. Time collapsed. The land remembers everything.
          </div>

          <p>Climb to Fortica — the Spanish Fortress perched above the town. The walk takes twenty minutes up stone steps lined with rosemary and sage that release their fragrance when you brush past. At the top, the view explains why every empire wanted this island: the entire Adriatic coast spreads before you, the Pakleni Islands float like green jewels in sapphire water, and Hvar Town cascades down the hillside in a tumble of terracotta roofs and white stone. I could see cruise ships at anchor, fishing boats heading out, ferries shuttling between islands. This is what dominion looks like when geography is your inheritance.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Hvar Town port (larger ships); Stari Grad (smaller vessels) — both put you near major attractions</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to Town Center:</strong> Hvar Town port directly at main square; Stari Grad 2 km walk to old town</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> Some ships tender depending on port traffic; smaller ships dock at pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Euro (EUR) — Croatia adopted euro January 2023; ATMs available in Hvar Town</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Croatian (English widely spoken in tourist areas; Italian understood by many)</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Right side; narrow medieval streets in town centers; car rental available but walking preferred</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> June-July for lavender blooms; May-June and September for weather; summer very sunny and warm</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Hvar Town Main Square (Trg Svetog Stjepana)</h4>
          <p>Croatia's largest and most beautiful town square — Renaissance architecture, St. Stephen's Cathedral with 16th-century bell tower, marble pavement, waterfront cafés. Arsenal building houses Europe's first public theater (1612). Free to walk; cathedral entry ~20 kuna. Direct from port. 1-2 hours exploring, longer for café sitting. This is where Hvar's soul lives.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fortica (Spanish Fortress)</h4>
          <p>16th-century hilltop fortress overlooking Hvar Town and Pakleni Islands. Panoramic 360-degree views of Adriatic, defensive walls, small museum. 20-minute uphill walk on stone steps (wear good shoes). ~60 kuna entry. Morning or late afternoon for best light. The view alone justifies the climb — this is postcard Croatia realized.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Stari Grad Plain (Ager)</h4>
          <p>UNESCO World Heritage Site — ancient Greek agricultural landscape from 384 BC. Original stone walls, field divisions, olive groves, vineyards still in use. Best explored by bike or guided tour (~€30-40). The oldest agricultural landscape in continuous use in the Mediterranean. Watching modern farmers work 2,400-year-old fields is profoundly moving.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Tvrdalj Castle (Petar Hektorović House)</h4>
          <p>16th-century fortified summer residence of Croatian Renaissance poet Petar Hektorović. Fishpond with inscribed Latin verses, Renaissance garden, defensive towers, literary museum. In Stari Grad old town. ~40 kuna entry. 45-minute visit. Intimate glimpse of Renaissance life — you can still read the poet's inscriptions carved into stone around the fishpond.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pakleni Islands</h4>
          <p>Archipelago of 21 islands off Hvar's southwest coast. Ferry trips (15 min, ~€10-15 return) to beaches, coves, beach clubs. Palmižana offers restaurants and botanical gardens; Stipanska known for clothing-optional sunbathing. Crystal-clear water, pine forests, secluded bays. Half-day minimum. The Adriatic's answer to paradise.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Lavender Fields & Local Markets</h4>
          <p>Hvar produces world's highest quality lavender. Fields bloom June-July across island's interior — purple waves stretching to the horizon. Markets in Hvar Town sell lavender oil, soap, honey, sachets. Best fields require taxi or tour (half-day ~€50). Even when not blooming, scent lingers everywhere. If you visit in summer, this is Hvar's signature experience.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Hvar Town entirely walkable — main square at port, fortress 20 min uphill. Pedestrian-only streets in old town. Wear comfortable shoes (cobblestones, steps).</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port; fixed prices to main destinations. Hvar Town to Stari Grad ~€20-25. Agree on fare before departure.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Taxi:</strong> Ferries to Pakleni Islands (15 min, ~€10-15 return). Depart from harbor near main square. Frequent service in summer.</li>
            <li><strong>Bike Rental:</strong> Excellent option for Stari Grad Plain and island exploration (~€15-20/day). Mostly flat terrain near coast; hilly interior.</li>
            <li><strong>Scooter/Car Rental:</strong> Available but unnecessary for cruise day. Roads narrow in towns; parking limited. Walking and water taxis cover main attractions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hvar Cakes (Paprenjaci):</strong> Traditional spiced cookies with black pepper, honey, saffron, coriander, and white wine. Unique sweet-savory flavor. Sold in bakeries throughout town.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Adriatic Seafood:</strong> Grilled fish (brancin/sea bass, orada/sea bream), octopus salad, black risotto with cuttlefish ink, buzara (shellfish stew). Waterfront restaurants specialize.</li>
            <li><strong>Gregada:</strong> Traditional Dalmatian fish stew — white fish, potatoes, onions, white wine, olive oil. Simple, delicious, local.</li>
            <li><strong>Organic Produce:</strong> Vegetables, fruits, olive oil from Stari Grad Plain's 2,400-year-old farms. Markets sell tomatoes, figs, honey that taste like sunshine.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Wines:</strong> Plavac Mali (red), Bogdanuša (white) — indigenous Croatian varieties. Hvar's wine tradition dates to ancient Greeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Lavender Honey:</strong> Produced from island's lavender fields. Floral, aromatic, unlike any other honey. Take a jar home.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lavender season (June-July) is spectacular but crowded. May and September offer perfect weather with fewer tourists.</li>
            <li>Fortica opens early (8 AM) — climb before cruise ship crowds arrive for nearly private panoramic views.</li>
            <li>Hvar Town has vibrant nightlife — if your ship overnights, experience why celebrities and royalty choose this island after dark.</li>
            <li>Croatia adopted the euro in 2023 — no more kuna conversions. ATMs available but bring euros for markets and small vendors.</li>
            <li>St. Stephen's Cathedral bell tower is climbable — tight spiral stairs but view rivals Fortica from different perspective.</li>
            <li>Water is drinkable but heavily chlorinated. Locals drink it; sensitive stomachs may prefer bottled.</li>
            <li>Small ship cruises along Dalmatian coast are increasingly popular — Hvar is often the highlight port.</li>
            <li>Pakleni Islands ferries fill quickly in peak summer — go early or book return time when you arrive.</li>
          </ul>
