      <h3>The Pizza Place Review: Solid Late-Night Slices, Not Much More</h3>

      <p><em>Introduction.</em> The Pizza Place is Virgin Voyages' dedicated pizza counter — a casual, walk-up venue serving personal-sized pizzas with a rotating selection of toppings. All pizza is complimentary (included in fare). The dough is made fresh onboard and pizzas are fired in a proper pizza oven, which elevates this above the steam-table pizza you might expect. The Pizza Place serves from lunch through late night, making it the go-to destination for 1 AM post-party fuel. No reservations needed.</p>

      <h4>Food &amp; Drinks</h4>
      <p>The margherita is the benchmark — thin crust, San Marzano-style sauce, proper mozzarella, and fresh basil. It is genuinely good pizza for a cruise ship and better than what most competing lines offer. The pepperoni is a crowd-pleaser with a good crispy edge. The mushroom and truffle oil pizza (when available) is the most creative option and has a loyal following. The dough quality is the real differentiator — properly fermented, with a nice char from the pizza oven. Where it falls short: the pizzas are small (personal-sized) and you may need two to feel full, which means two trips through the line. The topping selection is limited and does not change during the voyage. The cheese pizza is bland compared to the margherita. Non-pizza items (salads, garlic knots) are afterthoughts. The late-night quality can slip — the last pizzas of the evening sometimes sit a few minutes too long and the crust loses its crisp.</p>

      <h4>Service</h4>
      <p>Counter service is fast — pizzas come out of the oven every few minutes, so you rarely wait more than 5-10 minutes. The crew working the counter are efficient and cheerful. You order, they slice, you eat. The simplicity of the service model is a feature, not a bug. During late-night hours, the line can extend significantly, but it moves quickly.</p>

      <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>Casual and utilitarian — The Pizza Place is designed for grab-and-go rather than dining. Counter seating and a few small tables are available, but most guests take their pizza elsewhere (pool deck, cabin, lounge). The space is clean and well-lit but not designed to be a destination. Where it falls short: there is almost no ambiance. This is a counter, not a pizzeria. The seating is minimal and not particularly comfortable. The location (near the pool deck on most ships) means it shares the ambient noise and energy of the outdoor areas.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5.</strong> The Pizza Place delivers what it promises — good, free pizza with a quality crust and proper oven cooking. The margherita and pepperoni are genuinely solid, and the late-night availability is a welcome feature. It falls short on topping variety, portion size (small personal pizzas), atmosphere (nonexistent), and occasional quality dips during late-night service. <em>Tip:</em> order the margherita, eat it immediately while the crust is still crisp, and do not bother with the salad or garlic knots — they are not worth the line time.</p>
