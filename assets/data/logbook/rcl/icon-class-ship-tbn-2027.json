      "markdown": "**Royal Caribbean's third Icon-class vessel represents continued innovation within the proven Icon formula—expect the eight-neighborhood design with fresh signature elements.**\n\nThe Icon class established new benchmarks: LNG propulsion for environmental efficiency, the AquaDome's transforming entertainment venue, Category 6 as the ultimate waterpark, and neighborhoods designed for distinct guest experiences from Thrill Island to the Hideaway.\n\n[Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) launched in 2024 with Empire Supper Club as its signature dining experience. [Star of the Seas](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html) followed with Lincoln Park Supper Club, maintaining the theatrical dining concept while creating different ambiance.\n\nThis 2027 vessel continues that pattern. Expect the core Icon innovations—neighborhoods, AquaDome, Category 6, Surfside family zone—alongside new signature venues that distinguish her from her sisters.\n\nFor travelers watching Icon-class development: the formula works. The question isn't whether the ship delivers—it's which signature experiences appeal most to you.",

      "markdown": "**Booking an unnamed ship requires trust in the class concept. Icon class has earned that trust—and early bookings often reward it.**\n\nWhen [Icon of the Seas](/ships/rcl/icon-of-the-seas.html) opened for booking before her name was announced, early bookers secured inaugural sailings that later commanded premium pricing. The pattern repeated with [Star of the Seas](/ships/rcl/star-of-the-seas.html).\n\nFor the 2027 Icon-class vessel, the calculus is similar. If you know you want Icon-class features—the neighborhoods, the AquaDome, Category 6, the scale—early booking may offer advantages in pricing and cabin selection.\n\nThe risk is minimal if you're flexible on specific signature venues. The core experience remains consistent: eight neighborhoods, LNG environmental technology, approximately 7,600 guests at maximum capacity, Caribbean itineraries from a Florida homeport.\n\nFor travelers confident in Icon class: watch for booking announcements. Early access often proves worthwhile. The ship's name matters less than the class's proven delivery.",
