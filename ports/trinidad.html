            <div class="logbook-entry__content">
              <p>
                The steel pan was invented here, forged from oil drums when
                colonizers banned drums—trying to silence the rhythm that
                wouldn't be silenced. Standing in a panyard watching a band
                rehearse for Panorama, I understood that Trinidad's
                contribution to world culture isn't just Carnival. It's the
                idea that oppression can be transformed into art, that you can
                beat metal into music, and that celebration is itself a form
                of resistance.
              </p>
              <p class="logbook-entry__highlight">
                In Caroni Swamp at dusk, the boat drifted silently through
                mangrove channels while the guide whispered to watch the trees.
                Then they came—scarlet ibises by the hundred, flames against
                the green, settling into their roosts like the forest catching
                fire. When I finally looked up, the sky had turned pink and
                gold, and I realized I'd been holding my breath for five
                minutes.

            <h2>The Cruise Port</h2>
            <p>
              Cruise ships dock at the Port of Spain cruise terminal, located in
              the harbor area of Trinidad's capital city. The terminal offers
              basic facilities and is within walking distance of downtown and
              Queen's Park Savannah, the world's largest roundabout and the
              city's cultural heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike most Caribbean ports, Trinidad is not primarily a tourist
              destination—it's a working, vibrant nation with its own identity.
              The oil-rich economy means locals aren't dependent on cruise
              tourism, which can make for refreshingly authentic interactions.
              You're a guest, not a customer.

          <section class="port-section" id="culture">
            <h2>Carnival Culture</h2>
            <p>
              Trinidad Carnival (February/March, dates vary) is widely
              considered the mother of all Caribbean carnivals and one of the
              world's greatest street festivals. Even outside Carnival season,
              the culture permeates everything.
            </p>
            <h3>Year-Round Experiences</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Panyard Visits</strong>: Steel bands rehearse year-round.
                Some panyards welcome visitors, especially as Panorama (the
                national steel pan competition) approaches.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Calypso & Soca</strong>: Live music is everywhere. The
                Queen's Park Savannah area has venues featuring local artists.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mas Camp Tours</strong>: Costume-making workshops
                (mas camps) can be visited to see the artistry behind Carnival
                costumes.
              </li>

          <section class="port-section" id="attractions">
            <h2>Top Attractions</h2>

            <h3>Maracas Bay</h3>
            <p>
              Trinidad's most famous beach lies about 45 minutes north of Port
              of Spain over the scenic Northern Range. The palm-lined bay
              features excellent swimming and the legendary "shark and bake"
              vendors. Richard's is the most famous, but debate rages about
              which stall is truly best. Get there early—cruise ship crowds
              arrive by late morning.
            </p>

            <h3>Caroni Swamp</h3>
            <p>
              This mangrove wetland is home to the national bird: the scarlet
              ibis. Sunset boat tours are magical, as thousands of brilliant
              red birds return to roost. Tours typically depart around 4pm.
              Reserve in advance if possible—this is a must-do for nature
              lovers.
            </p>

            <h3>Queen's Park Savannah</h3>
            <p>
              The world's largest traffic circle (3.7km around) is also Port of
              Spain's park, jogging track, and social center. The Magnificent
              Seven—seven ornate colonial mansions on the western edge—showcase
              varied architectural styles. The National Museum and Royal
              Botanical Gardens are adjacent.
            </p>

            <h3>Asa Wright Nature Centre</h3>
            <p>
              World-famous birdwatching destination in the Northern Range
              rainforest. The verandah feeders attract tanagers, honeycreepers,
              and dozens of tropical species. Allow half a day for the drive
              and visit.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="port-section" id="food">
            <h2>Trinidadian Cuisine</h2>
            <p>
              Trinidad's food reflects its African, Indian, Chinese, and
              European influences. This is arguably the Caribbean's best food
              destination.
            </p>
            <h3>Must-Try Dishes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Doubles</strong>: Two pieces of fried bread (bara) with
                curried chickpeas. The quintessential street breakfast.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shark and Bake</strong>: Fried shark in fresh fried
                bread. Maracas Bay is the classic location.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Roti</strong>: Curry wrapped in dhalpuri or paratha
                roti. Chicken, goat, shrimp, or vegetable options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pelau</strong>: One-pot dish of rice, pigeon peas, and
                meat with caramelized sugar base.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Callaloo</strong>: Okra and dasheen leaf stew, often
                with crab.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pholourie</strong>: Fried split-pea dough balls with
                mango chutney. Perfect snack.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Drinks</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Carib/Stag</strong>: Local beers, perfect in the heat.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rum Punch</strong>: Trinidad's Angostura produces
                world-famous rum and bitters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mauby</strong>: Traditional bark-based beverage, an
                acquired taste.

          <section class="port-section" id="practical">
            <h2>Practical Information</h2>
            <h3>Getting Around</h3>
            <p>
              Taxis and tour operators are available at the cruise terminal.
              Agree on fares in advance. Maxi taxis (shared minibuses) are the
              local public transport but can be confusing for visitors. For
              attractions outside the city, organized tours or private
              transportation is recommended.
            </p>

            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>
              Trinidad and Tobago Dollar (TTD) is the local currency.
              Approximately 6.8 TTD = 1 USD (2025). US dollars are accepted at
              tourist venues but local currency gets better prices. ATMs widely
              available.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Port of Spain requires more caution than typical Caribbean ports.
              Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics. Stay in tourist
              areas and use official taxis. Laventille, Sea Lots, and Beetham
              areas should be avoided. The crime rate, while higher than some
              islands, shouldn't deter visitors who take sensible precautions.
            </p>

            <h3>Cultural Tips</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Trinidadians are direct communicators—don't mistake frankness
                for rudeness.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Liming" (hanging out) is a national pastime. Relax into the
                pace.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dress modestly when visiting religious sites (Hindu temples,
                mosques, churches).
              </li>

                <p>
                  Shark and bake is Trinidad's iconic beach food: fried shark
                  served in fresh fried bread (bake) with various condiments
                  like tamarind sauce, pepper sauce, and coleslaw. Richard's at
                  Maracas Bay is the most famous vendor.

                <p>
                  Yes, the Caroni Swamp boat tour at sunset is famous for
                  scarlet ibis viewing. Thousands of these bright red birds
                  return to roost in the mangroves each evening. Tours depart
                  around 4pm to catch sunset.

                <summary>Is Trinidad safe for cruise visitors?</summary>
                <p>
                  Trinidad requires more caution than typical Caribbean
                  destinations. Stick to tourist areas, use official taxis, and
                  avoid displaying valuables. Most cruise visitors have safe,
                  enjoyable experiences with basic precautions.
