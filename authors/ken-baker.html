      <h1>Ken Baker</h1>

      <p class="subtitle">Founder & Editor — In the Wake</p>

      <section class="author-bio">
        <h2>About Ken</h2>
        <p>Ken Baker is a traveler, pastor, and storyteller with over 50 cruises sailed across the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Alaska, and beyond. He founded In the Wake to share practical cruise planning tools, honest ship reviews, and faith-scented reflections for smoother sailings.</p>
        <p>After years of helping friends and church members plan their first cruises, Ken realized the same questions kept surfacing: Which ship is right for me? How do I navigate a port day? What should I actually pack? In the Wake was born from those conversations — a logbook of everything he wished someone had told him before his first sailing.</p>
        <p>Ken approaches cruising as both analyst and pilgrim. He loves digging into deck plans and comparing beverage package values, but he's equally drawn to the quiet moments — watching the sunrise from a balcony, photographing light on water, or sitting in the ship's chapel before the crowds wake. Travel, for Ken, is always about more than logistics; it's about encountering beauty and returning home changed.</p>

      <section class="author-philosophy">
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p><em>"The calmest seas are found in another's wake."</em></p>
        <p>Every page on this site is crafted with care, offered as worship to God, in gratitude for the beautiful things He has created for us to enjoy. Ken believes travel is a form of wonder — and that sharing what we've learned helps others sail with less anxiety and more anticipation.</p>
        <p>In the Wake exists to be the resource Ken wished he had: honest, thorough, and independent of cruise line marketing. No ads. No sponsored content. Just one cruiser's logbook, freely shared.</p>
