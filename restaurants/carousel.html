                        <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The Boardwalk carousel is a free, hand-carved merry-go-round in the heart of the Boardwalk neighborhood on Oasis and Icon Class ships. Open to all ages with no reservation needed. Especially magical at night when the lights illuminate—a perfect photo opportunity and nostalgic experience for the whole family.</p>
                    </div>

                    <section class="overview" id="overview">
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Rising from the center of the Boardwalk neighborhood, the carousel is one of Royal Caribbean's most photographed attractions. This isn't a mass-produced carnival ride—it's a genuine hand-carved carousel featuring beautifully detailed wooden horses and animals, each one unique and crafted by skilled artisans.</p>

                        <p>The carousel evokes the charm of early 20th-century seaside boardwalks, complete with ornate decorations, mirrors, and thousands of twinkling lights. During the day, it's a delightful diversion for families. At night, when the lights come alive against the open sky, it transforms into something truly magical.</p>

                        <h3>Design & Craftsmanship</h3>
                        <p>Each carousel animal is hand-carved from wood and hand-painted with intricate details. The horses feature traditional "jumper" and "stander" positions—some rising and falling as the carousel turns, others standing still for those who prefer a gentler ride. Beyond horses, you'll find other whimsical animals depending on the ship.</p>

                        <h3>The Boardwalk Setting</h3>
                        <p>The carousel sits in the open-air Boardwalk, a neighborhood unique to Oasis and Icon Class ships. Surrounded by Johnny Rockets, the candy shop, and various entertainment venues, it creates an authentic boardwalk atmosphere. The AquaTheater sits at the aft end, and the zip line soars overhead—it's the heart of family entertainment at sea.</p>
