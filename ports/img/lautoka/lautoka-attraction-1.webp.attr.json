  "description": "Statfold Barn Railway - diesel passes steam: The locomotive on the right is Lautoka No. 11 built by Hudswell Clarke of Leeds in 1912 as works No. 972. It was used by the Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd on Fiji and later converted to diesel power for a tourist railway. It was repatriated in 2011 in a very sorry state but was back in steam in 2014. On this occasion it was offering 'driver for a fiver' trips. Passing to the left is a passenger train behind a Plymouth 4wDM American built diesel industrial locomotive.",
