  "description": "<p>Handwritten on verso: Fort William H. Seward, about a mile from Haines at the upper end of the Inside Passage. Later named Chilkoot Barracks. \nPH Coll 413.Album 2.20a</p>\n<p>The name of the fort, Fort William H. Seward, honored the man who had negotiated the purchase of Alaska from the Russians, but the peninsula in Northwest Alaska on which Nome was located had already been named for him, as well as the city of Seward on the Kenai Peninsula. This caused confusion in the Post Office and other agencies for many years until the Post was renamed Chilkoot Barracks in 1922. (After the purchase of the fort in 1947 it was renamed \u201cPort Chilkoot.\u201d It resumed its original name when it was declared a Historic Landmark in 1972.)</p>\n<ul><li>Subjects (LCSH): Port Chilkoot (Haines, Alaska)</li></ul>",
