          <summary><h2>Captain's Logbook: Grand Turk</h2></summary>
        <div class="logbook-entry">

        <p class="author-disclaimer"><em>I visited Grand Turk in 2024 — my second visit to this tiny island paradise. These notes reflect my own wake through the turquoise waters of Turks &amp; Caicos.</em></p>

        <p>I stepped off the ship into a wall of Caribbean heat and immediately kicked off my flip-flops. Grand Turk is a sliver of paradise just 7 miles long and barely 1.5 miles wide — one of 40 islands scattered across the Turks & Caicos, though it's the only one with a cruise port. It's been the seat of government since 1766, and somehow the whole island still feels delightfully undiscovered despite being the second-most populated island in the territory.</p>

        <figure class="logbook-image float-right">
          <img fetchpriority="high" src="/ports/img/grand-turk/grand-turk-1.webp" alt="Grand Turk harbor view with cruise ships and turquoise water" loading="eager"/>

        </figure>

        <p>I walked straight past Carnival's $50 million Grand Turk Cruise Center (opened in 2006 with a 3,000-foot pier) and its sprawling lagoon-style pool, Ron Jon's Surf Shop, and the world's largest Margaritaville. If that's your scene, you're in heaven. But I turned left and walked 10 minutes to Governor's Beach instead — and found what I came for.</p>

        <p>Governor's Beach is what happens when nature decides to show off: zero crowds, powder-white sand so fine it squeaks underfoot, and water in seven impossible shades of blue. I claimed a patch of paradise, rented snorkel gear from a beachside shack ($15), and swam straight out to the drop-off. Grand Turk sits surrounded by one of the world's largest coral reefs, and the famous Grand Turk Wall — the world's third-deepest trench — starts just a kilometer offshore. The wall begins at a gentle 25–40 feet, then plunges 7,000 feet into the abyss.</p>

        <p>I floated above it feeling deliciously small while a spotted eagle ray (wingspan at least 5 feet) glided past like a stealth bomber. Schools of horse-eye jacks swirled around me in silver tornadoes. Green sea turtles paddled by without a care. I even saw a reef shark (4–5 feet) cruising the deep blue — far below and totally uninterested in humans. The visibility was absurd — easily 100 feet. I could see the sandy bottom 40 feet below me like looking through glass.</p>

        <figure class="logbook-image float-left">
          <img src="/ports/img/grand-turk/grand-turk-2.webp" alt="Grand Turk waterfront with colorful buildings and palm trees" loading="lazy"/>
          <figcaption>Grand Turk scenery — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a> (CC BY-SA)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>My afternoon was spent doing absolutely nothing except floating on pool noodles and eating conch two ways: cracked (fried) and ceviche-style with orange slices. The conch salad ($12) was so fresh it practically jumped back into the sea — tangy lime, sweet orange, fiery Scotch bonnet peppers, all tossed together by a local vendor who's been making it for thirty years. The taste of that fresh conch still lingers in my memory. I washed it down with Turk's Head beer ($5) while a cruise ship (not mine) sailed past on the horizon looking like a toy.</p>

        <p>Later, I wandered into Cockburn Town — the historic capital lined with 18th–20th century colonial homes painted in sherbet colors. The national museum is worth a peek if you're curious about the island's salt-raking past, which dominated this place for three centuries. By the Revolutionary War, the industry was so vital that George Washington himself requested Grand Turk salt for his troops. Wild donkeys still roam the island, descendants of pack animals that once hauled salt to waiting ships.</p>

        <p>I also stumbled across Splashdown Grand Turk, a quirky little museum celebrating the island's astonishing connection to American spaceflight — complete with 3,500 square feet of exhibits and a 20-foot replica of the Atlas rocket. This is where John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, returned to solid ground on February 20, 1962. The scent of old photographs and space memorabilia filled my lungs as I read about Glenn's historic orbit. Standing where an astronaut first touched Earth after circling our planet felt surreal.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> I was lying on my back in waist-deep water so clear it felt like flying, staring up at a single frigatebird soaring thousands of feet above in a cloudless blue sky. The world was perfectly silent except for the gentle lapping of waves. My eyes filled with unexpected tears — not from sadness, but from the overwhelming beauty of that ordinary moment. My heart swelled with gratitude for being alive, for being here, in water so turquoise it seemed impossible. Some moments need no photograph. They simply embed themselves in your soul and stay forever.
        </div>

        <p class="logbook-reflection"><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Grand Turk taught me that paradise doesn't require complexity. A perfect beach, clear water, fresh conch, and time to simply be — that's enough. The island's simplicity is its greatest gift. I left with renewed appreciation for places that haven't been over-developed, where you can still walk 10 minutes from a cruise ship and find yourself alone on a pristine beach with sea turtles swimming past. Some destinations try too hard. Grand Turk just exists, beautiful and unhurried, exactly as it should be.</p>

      <!-- CRUISE PORT SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="cruise_port" open>
        <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
        <p>Grand Turk's <strong>Cruise Center</strong> opened in 2006 as a $50 million Carnival project with a 3,000-foot pier that can handle the largest cruise ships afloat. You'll step directly off the gangway into a purpose-built resort complex complete with a massive lagoon-style pool (the largest in the Caribbean cruise industry), the world's biggest Margaritaville restaurant, a Jimmy Buffett-themed store, Ron Jon Surf Shop, and multiple restaurants and bars.</p>
        <p>The Cruise Center Beach runs the length of the complex — convenient but crowded when ships are in. For a more serene experience, walk 10 minutes south to Governor's Beach where you'll find pristine sand and far fewer people. The terrain is completely flat and suitable for wheelchairs and mobility devices. Currency is US dollars (this is a British Overseas Territory but the dollar is standard). Free Wi-Fi is available at many cruise center venues.</p>
      </details>

      <!-- GETTING AROUND SECTION -->
      <details class="port-section" id="getting_around" open>
        <summary><h2>Getting Around Grand Turk</h2></summary>
        <p>The beauty of Grand Turk is that you barely need wheels. The Cruise Center Beach is literally steps from the ship. Governor's Beach is a 10-minute walk south along the shore — about the time it takes to apply sunscreen while walking. Cockburn Town is about 15 minutes on foot or a $5 taxi ride. Everything is walkable for those with moderate mobility.</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Walking:</strong> The island is just 7 miles long — most attractions are within a 30-minute walk from the port. Flat terrain and paved roads make it accessible for wheelchairs and mobility scooters.</li>
          <li><strong>Golf cart rentals:</strong> $60-80/day opens up the whole island. Buzz up to the lighthouse, explore hidden coves, and find the perfect photo spot. Multiple rental agencies near the cruise center.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Plentiful at the port with fixed posted rates — no haggling required. Drivers double as tour guides. A full island tour runs about $25/person.</li>
          <li><strong>Beach shuttle:</strong> Free shuttle runs from cruise center to Governor's Beach if the walk is too far.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For accessibility, the flat terrain accommodates wheelchairs throughout. Beach wheelchairs are sometimes available at the cruise center — ask at guest services. The cruise center itself is fully accessible with ramps and accessible restrooms.</p>

A 10-minute walk south from the port. Lounge chairs and umbrellas available for rent ($10-15). Snorkel gear rentals ($15) let you explore the reef right offshore.</p>
        <p><strong>Pillory Beach</strong> offers excellent snorkeling and even fewer people — a quiet escape for those who want true solitude. The reef is accessible right from shore.</p>
        <p><strong>Cruise Center Beach</strong> runs along the entire port complex. Convenient but crowded. Pool, bars, and restaurants right at hand.</p>

        <h3>Water Activities</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Snorkeling the Grand Turk Wall:</strong> The famous wall starts about a kilometer offshore. Confident swimmers with good fins can reach it from Governor's Beach in 20-30 minutes. Visibility regularly exceeds 100 feet. You can book snorkel trips through your ship excursion desk for guaranteed return to the vessel, or independently with local operators at the beach ($40-60).</li>
          <li><strong>Scuba diving:</strong> Certified divers should book ahead — the wall is legendary with turtles, sharks, eagle rays, and pristine coral. Multiple dive operators at the cruise center offer half-day trips ($80-120).</li>
          <li><strong>Gibbs Cay stingray excursion:</strong> A short boat ride to a tiny uninhabited island where dozens of friendly southern brown stingrays swim right up to you in knee-deep water. Book through ship excursion or independent operators ($50-70). One of the most memorable experiences in the Caribbean.</li>
          <li><strong>Kayaking:</strong> Rentals available at the cruise center for exploring the calm waters around the island.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Land Excursions</h3>
        <p><strong>Island tour by golf cart or taxi:</strong> See the lighthouse, salt pans, wild donkeys, and historic Cockburn Town. Self-guided with a golf cart ($60-80/day) or with a local driver-guide ($25/person for 2 hours).</p>
        <p><strong>Splashdown Grand Turk Museum:</strong> Celebrates the island's connection to NASA's Mercury program. John Glenn's first step on land after orbiting Earth was right here. Free admission, 3,500 square feet of exhibits, 20-foot Atlas rocket replica.</p>
        <p><strong>Cockburn Town walking tour:</strong> Colonial architecture, national museum, and the spot where Columbus possibly made first landfall in 1492.</p>

        <p><em>Note: Popular excursions like Gibbs Cay fill quickly. Book ahead through your cruise line or independent operators for the best availability. Ship excursions offer guaranteed return to vessel if you're concerned about timing.</em></p>

        <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Practical tips before you step off the ship.</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Sun exposure:</strong> The sun reflects off that white sand like a mirror — even cloud cover can burn you in 30 minutes. Reapply sunscreen religiously. Bring a hat and UV-protective shirt.</li>
          <li><strong>Currency:</strong> U.S. dollars accepted everywhere despite being a British Overseas Territory. Credit cards work at the cruise center; bring cash for beach vendors.</li>
          <li><strong>Water:</strong> Bring a refillable water bottle. Stay hydrated in the tropical heat. Fresh water is available at the cruise center.</li>
          <li><strong>Beach gear:</strong> Snorkel rentals at Governor's Beach run $15. Lounge chairs and umbrellas $10-15. You can also bring your own from the ship.</li>
          <li><strong>Current awareness:</strong> If snorkeling toward the wall, be aware of currents. They can be strong and unpredictable. Swim with a buddy.</li>
          <li><strong>Whale season:</strong> December through April, consider the short ferry to Salt Cay where humpback whales migrate through. Swimming with them is extraordinary — book through independent operators in advance.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Governor's Beach is most peaceful early morning before all ships disembark. By 10am it starts filling up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Grand Turk is pure Caribbean simplicity — perfect beaches, clear water, and no pretense. Let the island's unhurried pace wash over you.</p>

      <details class="port-section" id="faq" open>
        <summary><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Grand Turk worth visiting on a cruise?</strong><br>A: Absolutely. This ranks among the top beach days in the Caribbean. Crystal-clear water, uncrowded Governor's Beach, world-class snorkeling on the Grand Turk Wall, and genuine island charm make it exceptional.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What's the best beach near the port?</strong><br>A: Governor's Beach, a 10-minute walk south from the cruise center. Pristine white sand, impossibly turquoise water, and far fewer crowds than the cruise center beach.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can you walk from the cruise port to attractions?</strong><br>A: Yes — everything is walkable. Governor's Beach is 10 minutes on foot. Cockburn Town is 15 minutes walking or a $5 taxi. The terrain is completely flat.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How is the snorkeling?</strong><br>A: World-class. The Grand Turk Wall is about a kilometer offshore with 100+ feet of visibility. Sea turtles, eagle rays, reef sharks, and tropical fish are common. Snorkel gear rents for $15 at the beach.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about the stingrays at Gibbs Cay?</strong><br>A: Highly recommended. Friendly southern brown stingrays swim right up to you in shallow water. Book through ship excursions or independent operators ($50-70). One of the Caribbean's most memorable experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors?</strong><br>A: The cruise center and main areas are fully accessible with flat terrain. Beach wheelchairs are sometimes available — ask at guest services. Governor's Beach has soft sand that may be challenging for standard wheelchairs.</p>
