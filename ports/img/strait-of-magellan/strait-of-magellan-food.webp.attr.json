The tramways, the common use ofmotor-cars and electricity, the good paving and goodshops, the beauty and fashion of the Chilean women,the beautifully built and equipped houses, the goodrestaurants, the plentiful supply of newspapers, theappearance and avocations of the people, render Val-paraiso and the Chilean capital among the front-rankcities of the world.
