      "markdown": "**Seabourn Encore launched in 2016 as Seabourn's first larger ship—600 guests versus the Odyssey Class's 458—testing whether the brand could scale without sacrificing intimacy.**\n\nThe expansion proved deliberate. Encore added capacity but also added space: more deck area per guest, more dining options, larger spa facilities. The ship grew guests and amenities proportionally.\n\n[Seabourn Ovation](/ships/seabourn/seabourn-ovation.html) followed in 2018 with identical design, validating the Encore Class approach. The pair now serves as Seabourn's primary conventional cruise vessels.\n\nDesign collaboration with hospitality designer Adam D. Tihany brought fresh perspective. Public spaces feel residential rather than nautical. The aesthetic positions Encore as boutique hotel that happens to sail.\n\nFor fleet context: Encore represents Seabourn's careful growth—larger capacity that expanded rather than diluted the intimate experience. The balance defines the Encore Class.",

Reservations fill quickly—book early.\n\nThe Colonnade transforms from breakfast buffet to evening restaurant featuring global cuisines. The versatility provides variety without requiring specialty restaurant supplements.\n\nSushi awaits at Sushi restaurant. Earth & Ocean Café offers casual pool deck options. The variety exceeds what 600 guests might expect.\n\nRoom service operates 24 hours with full menu.
