        <h1 id="page-title">⚓ Top 20 Questions I’m Asked About Cruising for the First Time</h1>
        <p class="motto">“Okay, be honest — I’ve never cruised before. What do I actually need to know?”</p>
        <p>Every time I post photos from a sailing, my inbox fills with that same question. So here it is — my full answer, tea brewed strong and tanged with the salt of experience. I gathered the policies from the cruise lines themselves, then laced them with what the sea teaches you after a few voyages: that the horizon is friend, not mystery.</p>
        <p>This is the guide I wish I’d had before my first embarkation. If you want to skim, use the <strong>Quick Chart</strong> on the right. If you want the whole story, come walk the deck with me.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Planning & Booking -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-planning">
        <h2>⚓ Planning &amp; Booking</h2>

        <h3 id="q-documents">What documents do I need for a cruise?</h3>
        <p>Think of your passport as your boarding pass to the world — it opens every gangway and every sunrise beyond your own coastline. For U.S. “closed-loop” cruises (round-trip from the same U.S. port), a birth certificate + government ID can work for U.S. citizens, but I still bring a passport. It’s smoother, safer, and the sea rewards those who prepare for every tide. Pro move: keep secure photos of your documents on your phone, just in case.</p>

        <h3 id="q-choose-line">How do I choose a cruise line, ship, or itinerary?</h3>
        <p>Ships have personalities. Families thrive on Royal Caribbean’s energy; couples drift toward Celebrity’s calm; solo sailors often find kindred spirits on Virgin Voyages. Start near home to test your sea legs — 4–7-night Caribbean itineraries are perfect first crossings. The ship is half the experience; the itinerary is the other half. Know your vibe and pick both accordingly.</p>

        <h3 id="q-when-book">When’s the best time to book and sail?</h3>
        <p>Book early for choice, late for chance. Spring and fall bring kinder seas and smaller crowds. School breaks swing the vibe younger; check the break calendar for your <em>departure state</em>. Shoulder seasons often feel like cruising in smooth water behind a steady hull.</p>

        <h3 id="q-included">What’s actually included in the fare?</h3>
        <p>Your fare buys more than passage; it buys a floating city of meals, music, and open water. Figure roughly $500–$1,000 per person for a week in an interior cabin, with main dining and entertainment included. Wi-Fi, drinks, and excursions are the extras that color the ledger. My rule: set aside ~25% extra for “sea-day decisions.”</p>

        <h3 id="q-insurance">Do I really need travel insurance?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The ocean is generous but unpredictable. If you can’t afford to lose the trip, you can’t afford to skip the insurance. Look for medical coverage at sea and read the fine print on pre-existing conditions and cancellation terms.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Packing & Prep -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-packing">
        <h2>🧳 Packing &amp; Preparation</h2>

        <h3 id="q-pack">What should I pack?</h3>
        <p>Pack like a mariner — efficient and adaptable. A few light layers, one good outfit for formal night, comfortable shoes, sunscreen, motion remedies, and a waterproof pouch for phone + passport. Cabins hide storage in clever places. For lists tuned by destination, see our <a href="https://www.cruisinginthewake.com/packing-lists.html">Packing Lists</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="q-alcohol">Can I bring my own alcohol or food?</h3>
        <p>Usually a bottle or two of wine per adult, yes; beer and liquor, no. Non-alcoholic drinks vary. Rules change, so check your line’s policy before you pack.</p>

        <h3 id="q-seasick">How do I keep from getting seasick?</h3>
        <p>Pick a mid-ship, lower-deck cabin. Modern stabilizers tame most swells, but I still bring ginger chews; fresh ginger from the galley works wonders. If you know you’re prone, talk to your doctor about scopolamine patches. Pro tip: fix your eyes on the horizon — it steadies more than your stomach.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Life Onboard -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-onboard">
        <h2>🚢 Life Onboard</h2>

        <h3 id="q-crowd">Isn’t cruising just for retirees or partiers?</h3>
        <p>Hardly. Ships are floating neighborhoods: grandparents, honeymooners, toddlers, teens — all sharing sunsets in their own way. The tempo ranges from karaoke to quiet piano bars; you’ll find your rhythm by day two.</p>

        <h3 id="q-food">How’s the food — and do I need a drink package?</h3>
        <p>Food is half the fun: sunrise buffets, late-night bites, global menus. Specialty venues (steakhouse, sushi, Italian) cost extra and shine on longer voyages. Drink packages only pay off if you plan to indulge daily; otherwise the complimentary water, coffee, and lemonade go far.</p>

        <h3 id="q-seadays">Will I get bored on sea days?</h3>
        <p>Only if you work at it. Between live music, trivia, lectures, and the hypnotic rhythm of the wake, sea days can feel like the world pressed “pause.” I keep a book and let the aft deck do its slow magic.</p>

        <h3 id="q-grats">How do gratuities and onboard payments work?</h3>
        <p>Your key card is your wallet — protect it. Daily gratuities (around $16 pp) are added automatically and shared among crew, including the teams you don’t see. I still tip in person when someone truly makes the voyage shine. Gratitude, like the tide, is best given freely.</p>

        <h3 id="q-cabins">Are cabins really that small?</h3>
        <p>Yes — and they’re marvels of design. Use magnetic hooks, pack cubes, and store bags under the bed. Outlets are the pinch point; many surge protectors are banned, so pack accordingly. A balcony adds breathing room, but good coffee by a window at dawn is just as restorative.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Ports & Excursions -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-ports">
        <h2>⚓ Ports &amp; Excursions</h2>

        <h3 id="q-passport-port">Do I need my passport in port?</h3>
        <p>If the gangway drops on foreign soil, treat it like international travel. Some lines hold passports for specific itineraries; otherwise carry it, secure it, and respect local rules.</p>

        <h3 id="q-late">What if I’m late getting back to the ship?</h3>
        <p><strong>Stay on ship time — always.</strong> Phone auto-switch can betray you; set a manual alarm to ship time. On a ship excursion, they will wait. On your own, the tide — and the timetable — wait for no one. Pad your return buffer; “all aboard” is usually 1–2 hours before departure.</p>

        <h3 id="q-stayonboard">Can I just stay onboard instead?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. A ship in port is the quietest place on earth. Pools empty, cafés hum softly, and the horizon belongs entirely to you.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Safety & Health -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-safety">
        <h2>⚕️ Safety &amp; Health</h2>

        <h3 id="q-illness">Are ships safe from illness?</h3>
        <p>Cruise ships are cleaner than most cities. Sanitizer stations gleam at every doorway, and crew wipe handrails like clockwork. I wash before meals and after shore excursions and, in two decades — even through the chaos of a global pandemic — I’ve caught nothing worse than a sunburn. One lesson I’ve seen repeat: those who skip the sink carry the most regret. If staff is insistent about handwashing, take it seriously.</p>

        <h3 id="q-weather">What happens in bad weather?</h3>
        <p>Captains read the sea like a diary. Lines have billions invested in your good time and will route around storms whenever possible. When seas kick, modern ships are engineered with stabilizers and redundancy you’ll never notice — which is the point.</p>

        <h3 id="q-kids-pregnancy">Can kids or pregnant guests sail?</h3>
        <p>Infants generally must be 6–12 months (itinerary-dependent). Pregnant guests are usually cleared until 24–28 weeks — confirm your line’s policy and bring documentation. Kids’ clubs on Disney, Royal, and Norwegian are joys unto themselves.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Disembarkation -->
      <section class="card" id="sec-debark">
        <h2>⛵ Disembarkation &amp; After</h2>

        <h3 id="q-debark">How does getting off the ship actually work?</h3>
        <p>Self-assist means you keep your bags and walk off early; otherwise, set them out the night before and follow the color code in the terminal. Eat breakfast early, smile at customs, and avoid flights before noon.</p>

        <h3 id="q-weight">And the big one… will I gain weight?</h3>
        <p>Maybe — if you make it your mission. Between steps, excursions, and stairs, most passengers balance it out. A few extra desserts are just ballast for the soul.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>🐚 Final Thought</h2>
        <p>Cruising is the one kind of travel where you unpack once and wake up somewhere new every morning — motion and stillness in the same heartbeat. If this is your first voyage, know this: the sea will meet you halfway. Ask questions, bring wonder, and leave room for awe.</p>
