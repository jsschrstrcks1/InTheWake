        <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Barcelona is a major embarkation port and port of call. La Sagrada Familia and Park Güell are must-sees (book tickets in advance). La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, and La Boqueria market are walkable from port. Ships dock at terminals near the bottom of La Rambla.

      <h1>Barcelona: Where Gaudí Meets the Mediterranean</h1>

      <div class="logbook-entry">
        <p>Barcelona is one of those cities that could easily consume a week, yet we often try to see it in a day. I've visited on three cruises — once as an embarkation port where I arrived two days early, once as a port of call with only seven hours, and once as a quick transit where I barely left the port area. Each visit taught me something different about this city, but they all confirmed one thing: Barcelona deserves your time.</p>

        <p>The cruise port sits at the base of La Rambla, Barcelona's famous tree-lined pedestrian boulevard that runs from the waterfront up to Plaça de Catalunya. From the World Trade Center terminal, you can walk onto La Rambla in ten minutes. This is both a blessing and a trap — La Rambla is crowded, touristy, and has unfortunately become known for pickpockets. But it's also still charming: the flower stalls, the human statues, the energy of a city that lives outdoors. Just keep your wallet secure and don't linger too long. The real Barcelona waits elsewhere.</p>

        <p>On my longest visit, I went straight to La Sagrada Familia, and I'll tell you now: book your tickets online weeks in advance. Gaudí's unfinished basilica is Barcelona's most visited site, and the timed-entry tickets sell out fast. But this is not just tourist hype — La Sagrada Familia is genuinely one of the most astonishing buildings on Earth. Construction began in 1882 and won't be complete until 2026 (maybe), and every surface is a prayer in stone. The interior is a forest of columns that branch like trees, light streaming through stained glass in impossible colors, the whole space designed to make you look up. I'm not Catholic, and I wept.</p>

        <p>Park Güell is Gaudí's other essential work in Barcelona — a public park originally planned as an exclusive residential development, now filled with mosaic sculptures, undulating benches, and views over the city to the sea. The famous terrace with the serpentine bench requires a timed ticket, but even the free areas of the park are beautiful. Casa Batlló and Casa Milà (La Pedrera) on Passeig de Gràcia are two more Gaudí masterpieces; I'd recommend picking one if time is short. Casa Batlló has the better interior; La Pedrera has the better rooftop.</p>

        <p>The Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic) is where Barcelona feels most medieval — narrow streets, hidden plazas, the cathedral with its cloister full of geese. I got deliberately lost here for an afternoon, finding tiny bars serving vermouth, shops selling handmade espadrilles, and churches where locals actually pray. The El Born neighborhood next door is trendier, with boutiques and cocktail bars in medieval buildings. And the Barceloneta beach, a short walk from the port, offers a chance to actually touch the Mediterranean — though don't expect pristine sand; it's a city beach.</p>

        <div class="poignant-highlight">
          <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Late afternoon light inside La Sagrada Familia, the sun pouring through the western windows, turning the interior into a kaleidoscope of reds, oranges, and yellows. I stood in the nave and watched the light move across the columns like a living thing. Gaudí designed this intentionally — every window, every angle calculated to make light itself part of the worship. A hundred years after his death, his building still catches God's light and scatters it like glory.
        </div>

        <p>For food, Barcelona offers tapas, but it's not the tapas capital — that's actually San Sebastián or Madrid. What Barcelona does supremely well is seafood, especially at the market restaurants. La Boqueria, the famous market off La Rambla, has counters serving fresh-shucked oysters, jamón ibérico, and whatever came in that morning. The prices at the front are tourist-inflated; walk deeper in for better value. For a sit-down meal, try the neighborhood restaurants in Gràcia or Poble Sec where locals actually eat.</p>

        <p>If Barcelona is your embarkation port, I strongly recommend arriving at least one night early (two is better). The city's architecture, food, and neighborhoods simply cannot be appreciated in a few hours between ship and airport. And if it's a port call, make choices: Sagrada Familia and Gothic Quarter is a realistic half-day; add Park Güell only if you have 8+ hours and want to move fast. Don't try to see everything. Barcelona will still be here next time.</p>

        <p>One more thing: Barcelona is Catalan before it is Spanish. The language on signs is Catalan (not Spanish), the culture has its own proud identity, and independence remains a live political issue. This doesn't affect tourists practically, but it's worth understanding. You're not in "Spain" exactly — you're in Catalunya, with all the complexity that entails.</p>

        <h3>Getting Around Barcelona</h3>
        <p>Ships typically dock at one of several terminals near the bottom of La Rambla. From there:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>La Rambla / Gothic Quarter:</strong> 10–15 minute walk from most terminals</li>
          <li><strong>La Sagrada Familia (4 km):</strong> Taxi €10–15, Metro L3 to Passeig de Gràcia then L2 to Sagrada Familia</li>
          <li><strong>Park Güell (6 km):</strong> Taxi €15–20, or Bus #24 from Passeig de Gràcia. It's uphill; save energy for the park.</li>
          <li><strong>La Boqueria Market:</strong> On La Rambla, 10 min walk from port</li>
          <li><strong>Barceloneta Beach:</strong> 15 min walk along the waterfront from port</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Buy a T-Casual 10-journey Metro card (€11.35) for unlimited zone-1 travel. The Metro is efficient and air-conditioned. Or use taxis — they're metered, honest, and not expensive by European standards.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="port-section">
        <h3>Positively Framed Word of Warning</h3>
        <p>Barcelona's popularity means you need to plan ahead. Book La Sagrada Familia tickets weeks in advance — same-day entry is nearly impossible in high season. Pickpockets are unfortunately common on La Rambla, in the Metro, and in crowded tourist areas; wear a money belt and keep bags secured in front of you. These are crimes of opportunity, not violence. Stay alert, and you'll be fine. Most visitors experience only the city's tremendous hospitality and beauty — the problems are real but manageable with basic awareness.</p>

        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Do I need tickets for La Sagrada Familia?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes, absolutely. Buy timed-entry tickets online at sagradafamilia.org weeks in advance. Same-day tickets are rarely available. Including tower access adds about €10 but offers amazing views.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">How far is the cruise port from the city center?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Very close — the terminals are at the base of La Rambla. You can walk to the Gothic Quarter in 10–15 minutes. Some terminals are farther; shuttle buses connect to the port entrance.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e8f0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Can I see both La Sagrada Familia and Park Güell in one port day?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes, if you have 7–8 hours and move efficiently. Do Sagrada Familia first (morning light is beautiful), taxi to Park Güell, then return to the Gothic Quarter. Skip one if you want a more relaxed pace.</p>
      </details>

      <details style="margin: 0.75rem 0; padding: 0.75rem 0;">
        <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">Is La Boqueria worth visiting?</summary>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0; padding-left: 1rem;">Yes, but go early (before 11am) and walk past the front stalls to find better prices. The market can be overwhelmingly crowded by midday. Great for fresh fruit, jamón, and counter-service seafood.</p>
