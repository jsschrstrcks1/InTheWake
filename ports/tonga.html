        <h1>Tonga: Where the King Still Reigns</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>Tonga is the Pacific's last kingdom — not metaphorically, actually. The only remaining Polynesian monarchy in existence, never colonized, never conquered, stubbornly sovereign since time immemorial. Stepping off the ship at Vuna Wharf, I could walk directly into downtown Nuku'alofa, the royal capital where the King and Queen still live, still rule, still attend Sunday services at Centenary Church while their subjects dress in their finest and sing hymns that could raise the dead.</p>

          <p>This is not a museum-piece monarchy. The Royal Palace — a white Victorian gingerbread wedding cake from 1867 — sits behind wrought iron gates on the waterfront, laundry hanging in the royal compound, guards in full ceremonial uniform standing watch. You can't go inside, but you can stand at the fence and contemplate the strange survival of hereditary rule in the 21st century. Across the road, the Royal Tombs occupy a manicured park where generations of monarchs rest beneath mounded earth and carved stone. The current King's ancestors are all here, and someday he will be too.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing at the Mapu'a'a Vaea Blowholes — "The Chief's Whistles" — watching the Pacific Ocean force itself through ancient coral rock with such violence that it shot thirty meters straight up into the blue Tongan sky. The sound was like a freight train exhaling. The spray caught the light and made rainbows. For a moment I understood why ancient Tongans believed the gods lived in stone and sea. The power wasn't metaphorical. It was geology performing miracles.
          </div>

          <p>Tongans call their islands "The Friendly Islands" — Captain Cook's name, still in use, still accurate. Every interaction felt genuinely warm, unhurried, kind. This is a deeply Christian nation where Sunday is sacred (everything closes), modesty is non-negotiable (cover shoulders and knees), and the rhythm of life bends toward family, faith, and the slow work of maintaining culture in a world that would rather you become a beach resort.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Vuna Wharf — right on the edge of downtown Nuku'alofa; walk directly into town</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> Downtown immediately adjacent — 2-5 minute walk from ship</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Tongan Pa'anga (TOP); US Dollar sometimes accepted; ATMs available but bring cash</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Tongan, English (English widely spoken in tourism and business)</li>

            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> May-October (dry season); November-April wet/cyclone season but still warm</li>
            <li><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Conservative culture — cover shoulders and knees in town; swimwear only at beaches</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Limited connectivity (undersea cable damage 2024) — enjoy the digital detox</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mapu'a'a Vaea Blowholes — "The Chief's Whistles"</h4>
          <p>Ocean forced through ancient coral rock creates spectacular water geysers shooting 30 meters into the air. Located on Tongatapu's southern coast, 30 minutes from port by car. Pressure pockets in the reef make the blowholes whistle and roar. Best at high tide with southerly swells. Free admission. Bring camera and prepare to be soaked by spray. Half-day excursion including other south coast sights.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Royal Palace & Royal Tombs</h4>
          <p>The 1867 white colonial wooden palace where Tonga's royal family still resides — viewable from the waterfront but not open to public. Ornate Victorian architecture set in tropical gardens. Adjacent Royal Tombs in manicured parkland (viewable through fence) hold generations of Tongan monarchs. On Sundays, the King and Queen worship at nearby Centenary Church. Walking distance from port. 30-60 minutes respectful viewing. Dress modestly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Ha'amonga 'a Maui Trilithon — "Stonehenge of the Pacific"</h4>
          <p>Massive 13th-century stone gateway — two coral-limestone pillars supporting a crossbeam, each stone weighing 30-40 tons. Built by Tu'itatui in 1200 AD, purpose still debated (astronomical calendar? royal gateway?). 40-minute drive from Nuku'alofa. Stands in open field, quietly monumental. Free access. Combine with Captain Cook's Landing Site nearby. Allow 2-3 hours round trip.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Pangaimotu Island</h4>
          <p>Small island just offshore — 15-20 minute ferry from Faua Jetty (near port). Beach, palm trees, snorkeling over shipwreck, casual beachside restaurant. Relaxed tropical island experience without extensive travel. Ferry ~20-30 TOP ($8-12) round trip. Snorkel gear rental available. Half-day minimum. Bring reef-safe sunscreen and modest cover-up for ferry ride.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Talamahu Market</h4>
          <p>Largest market in Tonga — produce, handicrafts, tapa cloth, woven baskets, tropical fruit (papayas, mangoes, passion fruit). Experience local life, bargain gently, support Tongan artisans. Downtown Nuku'alofa, easy walk from port. Morning best for freshest produce. Free to browse. 1-2 hours. Bring small bills (Pa'anga) for purchases. Saturday busiest day.</p>

          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Downtown Nuku'alofa immediately accessible from Vuna Wharf — Royal Palace, markets, shops all within 5-15 minute walk.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Available at port; negotiate fare before departure. Expect ~30-40 TOP ($12-16) for blowholes/trilithon day tour. No meters — agree on price and itinerary.</li>
            <li><strong>Tour Operators:</strong> Local guides offer island tours (south coast blowholes + east coast trilithon) ~60-80 TOP ($25-35) per person. Book through ship or at port.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Rental:</strong> Available (~$50-70/day). Roads decent on Tongatapu. Traffic drives on left. International license required. Good option for independent exploration.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry to Islands:</strong> Pangaimotu and other nearby islands accessible by small ferry from Faua Jetty. Schedules flexible — confirm return time.</li>

          <h3>Local Food & Drink</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lu Pulu:</strong> Tongan feast dish — corned beef, onions, coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves and baked. Rich, savory, culturally significant.</li>
            <li><strong>'Ota 'Ika:</strong> Raw fish salad marinated in coconut cream, lime, chili, vegetables. Tongan ceviche — fresh, vibrant, delicious.</li>
            <li><strong>Roast Suckling Pig:</strong> Whole pig roasted in underground umu (earth oven). Traditional feast centerpiece. Tender, smoky, ceremonial.</li>
            <li><strong>Tropical Fruit:</strong> Papayas, mangoes, passion fruit, bananas — ridiculously fresh and sweet from Talamahu Market.</li>
            <li><strong>Kava:</strong> Traditional ceremonial drink — root of pepper plant, mildly sedative, cultural experience. Offered at kava ceremonies (tourists sometimes invited). Tastes earthy, slightly numbing.</li>
            <li><strong>Royal Beer:</strong> Local Tongan lager — light, refreshing, patriotic name. Available at restaurants and shops.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="port-section">
          <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dress modestly — Tonga is deeply religious and conservative. Cover shoulders and knees when in town or at cultural sites. Respect local norms.</li>
            <li>Sunday is sacred — nearly everything closes. Churches packed, shops shuttered, even taxis scarce. If in port Sunday, attend church service (visitors welcome, dress formally) or relax on ship.</li>
            <li>Blowholes best at high tide with southerly swells — check tide tables and weather. Calm seas = underwhelming blowholes.</li>
            <li>Internet severely limited after 2024 undersea cable damage — embrace digital detox. Ship wifi may be only reliable connection.</li>
            <li>Bring cash (Pa'anga) for markets, taxis, small purchases — credit cards not widely accepted outside hotels/resorts.</li>
            <li>Royal Palace not open to public but photograph from waterfront respectfully. Don't climb gates or disturb guards.</li>
            <li>Ha'amonga 'a Maui Trilithon looks modest in photos but profoundly impressive in person — don't skip it.</li>
            <li>Tongans are warm and friendly but formal — greet people, ask permission before photographing, show respect for monarchy and church.</li>
          </ul>
