        <!-- Logbook Entry -->
        <details class="port-section logbook" open>
          <summary><h2>From the Logbook</h2></summary>
          <div class="logbook-content">
            <p>The morning began before dawn, our ship positioned at the mouth of the Gatun Locks, waiting for first light. By the time we cleared the lock chambers—a spectacle of its own, water lifting our vessel 85 feet above sea level—we emerged onto Gatun Lake, and the world changed entirely. Gone were the industrial structures of the canal zone. In their place: a vast inland sea surrounded by rainforest so thick it seemed painted rather than grown. The lake stretched before us like something from a nature documentary, tree-covered islands dotting the surface, mist rising from the water in the morning cool. I understood immediately why this transit feels less like engineering and more like entering another world.</p>

            <p>Our ship moved slowly—eight knots, maybe ten—engines barely humming as we crossed the 33-mile stretch of freshwater that forms the canal's heart. The captain explained over the PA that Gatun Lake was created by damming the Chagres River, completed in 1913 when it became the largest man-made lake in the world. I tried to imagine the valley below us: drowned villages, flooded forests, an entire landscape sacrificed so ships could cross between oceans. The hills that now rise as islands were once hilltops where people lived. Some buildings were relocated; others simply abandoned to the rising water. During extreme droughts, I'm told, the ruins sometimes reappear like ghosts.</p>

            <p>My wife spotted the first crocodile within twenty minutes of entering the lake—a massive American crocodile sunning itself on a muddy bank, so motionless it might have been carved from the earth. We pulled out binoculars and scanned the shoreline, finding more: one, two, three, each a prehistoric shadow waiting in the morning light. The ranger who had boarded our ship pointed out a particularly large specimen, estimating it at fifteen feet. I felt grateful for the distance between our deck and that bank, yet grateful too for the privilege of seeing such creatures in their natural environment.</p>

            <p>Then came the sounds—deep, rumbling roars that carried across the water like distant thunder. Howler monkeys, the ranger explained, announcing territorial boundaries in the canopy. I scanned the treetops with binoculars until I spotted movement: a family group crashing through branches, their black forms silhouetted against the green. The sound they produced seemed impossible for creatures their size, a bass rumble that vibrated in my chest from a quarter mile away. I watched one male throw back his head and bellow, and I understood why early explorers thought jaguars were hunting in the forest.</p>

            <p>Barro Colorado Island slid past on our starboard side—a forested hill that became an island when the valley flooded and has been a Smithsonian research station since 1923. Scientists have studied this protected rainforest longer than almost anywhere else on Earth. I could see research buildings barely visible through the jungle, small wooden structures that seemed humble against the scale of the forest they studied. The island is closed to casual visitors, but its existence ensures these waters remain pristine. Knowing that decades of careful observation were happening behind those trees made the whole lake feel more sacred somehow.</p>

            <p>A sloth appeared in a tree near the waterline—motionless, of course, hanging from a branch like a furry ornament. A passenger nearby had been scanning for an hour before spotting it, and her delighted cry brought a dozen of us to the rail with binoculars trained on that single tree. Toucans flashed brilliant colors as they crossed gaps in the canopy. Herons stood sentinel on floating logs. A group of capybaras—the world's largest rodents, looking like oversized guinea pigs—grazed along a shoreline clearing. The wildlife density was extraordinary, and I understood why some passengers book Panama Canal cruises specifically for this transit.</p>

            <p>The practical matters felt almost incidental: the heat was intense, tropical sun bouncing off the water in all directions, and I was thankful for sunscreen and a hat. The humidity wrapped around us like a warm blanket. Water and shade became precious commodities on deck. However, nobody seemed to mind. Something about crossing this accidental wilderness—this man-made lake that became a nature sanctuary—made discomfort feel like a small price for wonder.</p>

            <p><strong>The moment that stays with me:</strong> Engine noise fading to near silence as we drifted past Barro Colorado Island, howler monkeys calling from the forest, a crocodile watching from the bank—and my wife squeezing my hand as she whispered, "Can you believe we're here?" My heart swelled with gratitude so fierce it caught me off guard. Tears pricked my eyes at the sheer improbability of it: two people from landlocked states, floating through Panamanian rainforest on a ship between two oceans. I learned something about perspective that morning—that engineering marvels and natural wonders aren't opposites, that sometimes the grandest human achievement is knowing when to flood a valley and let nature reclaim it. I felt blessed and thankful for every moment of that crossing.</p>

          <summary><h2>The Cruise Port</h2></summary>
          <div class="cruise-port-content">
            <p>Gatun Lake isn't a port—you never dock, never disembark. This is scenic cruising at its finest: 2-3 hours crossing a vast freshwater lake surrounded by rainforest as part of the Panama Canal transit. Your ship becomes your viewing platform for wildlife, engineering history, and tropical landscapes that feel impossibly remote despite being one of the world's busiest shipping channels.</p>

            <p>The lake sits 85 feet above sea level, reached after ascending through the Gatun Locks from the Atlantic side (or the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores Locks from the Pacific). Ships travel at reduced speed—typically 8-10 knots—both for safety and to minimize wake erosion on the forested shoreline. This slower pace is ideal for viewing. Currency in Panama is USD. Most ships provide expert narration during the canal transit, explaining history, engineering, and ecology.</p>

            <p><strong>Stamina level: low.</strong> This is deck viewing—no walking required. However, the tropical heat and humidity are intense (80-90°F, 75-90% humidity). Sun protection is essential as there's limited shade on outer decks. Wheelchair access to viewing areas varies by ship; check with guest services. The main challenge is patience and positioning, not physical exertion. Bring water, bring sunscreen, and bring binoculars.</p>

        <!-- Getting Around Section -->
        <details class="port-section getting-around" open>
          <summary><h2>Getting Around</h2></summary>
          <div class="getting-around-content">
            <p><strong>Forward bow:</strong> The best unobstructed views, especially for wildlife spotting and approaching the locks. Fills early—stake out a spot before entering the lake. Rangers often set up viewing stations here. Bring chairs or cushions if allowed, plus sun protection. Both sides offer good viewing; the starboard (right) side often passes closer to Barro Colorado Island.</p>

            <p><strong>Upper decks:</strong> Higher vantage points offer better views over shoreline vegetation. The helicopter pad (if accessible) provides 360-degree views. More exposed to sun and wind than lower decks. Generally accessible for wheelchair users—check with guest services for specific locations and elevator access.</p>

            <p><strong>Private balcony:</strong> If you have one, your balcony offers comfort, privacy, and protection from crowds. Order room service and watch the rainforest slide past without leaving your cabin. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for a balcony stateroom if budget allows ($200-500 more than inside cabins)—worth it for canal transit days.</p>

            <p><strong>Indoor viewing:</strong> Most ships have observation lounges with floor-to-ceiling windows. Climate-controlled with seating and bar service. The promenade deck offers protected walking areas with viewing opportunities. Good for those who can't tolerate extended sun exposure. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> sometimes include special viewing access or expert narration beyond the standard PA announcements.</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Deck viewing is generally accessible, though crowds on canal day can make navigation challenging. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration of the ship's viewing areas works well; rangers move between stations throughout the day. Elevators provide access to most outdoor decks. Communicate needs early with guest services for the best viewing accommodations.</p>

          <summary><h2>Shore Excursions</h2></summary>
          <div class="excursions-content">
            <p>Since Gatun Lake is transit cruising with no port stop, "excursions" means onboard programs designed to enhance your viewing experience. Most are included in your cruise fare; some specialty options require booking. <strong>Ship excursions</strong> for the full Panama Canal transit typically cost $80-150 and include expert narration.</p>

            <h3>Ranger/Expert Narration</h3>
            <p>Most cruise lines provide expert narration during the canal transit, either from ship naturalists or guest speakers. This transforms passive viewing into active learning about the canal's construction (1904-1914), the engineering that created the lake, and the wildlife you're seeing. Usually broadcast over the ship's PA system. Free and included with your cruise. <strong>Book ahead</strong> for any special lectures or presentations—they fill quickly on canal days.</p>

            <h3>Wildlife Viewing Stations</h3>
            <p>Some ships set up dedicated wildlife viewing stations with crew members helping spot animals and answer questions. Binocular rentals may be available ($10-20) if you didn't bring your own. These stations are positioned at the best viewing locations on deck, often with spotting scopes for distant wildlife. No booking required—just show up. Early risers get the best positions. <strong>Independent</strong> exploration of different viewing areas throughout the transit is strongly encouraged.</p>

            <h3>Camera Workshops</h3>
            <p>Some cruise lines offer camera workshops or special sessions on canal transit days ($50-100). Even without a formal program, this is the day to charge all batteries, clear memory cards, and bring a telephoto lens. The light can be challenging—bright sun and deep forest shadows require camera skill. Many passengers capture hundreds of shots during the crossing.</p>

            <h3>Room Service Strategy</h3>
            <p>The best "excursion" may be free: order room service ($5-15 gratuity) for breakfast and lunch so you don't miss viewing time in the main dining rooms. A balcony stateroom becomes your private wildlife watching station—yours alone for the entire crossing, with comfortable seating and climate control when the tropical sun becomes too intense. Bring water bottles and snacks to the deck for extended viewing sessions. The ship's coffee bar charges $4-6 per specialty drink—consider bringing a thermos with your own hot beverage to save money and time.</p>

            <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
            <p>Expert narration is typically included—no booking needed. If your cruise line offers special viewing events or lectures, <strong>book ahead</strong> through the ship's app or guest services. For the best overall experience, <strong>book ahead</strong> for a balcony stateroom when you initially book your cruise. <strong>Guaranteed return</strong> isn't relevant here—you never leave the ship—but <strong>ship excursions</strong> for the full canal transit ensure expert guidance throughout.</p>

        <!-- Depth Soundings Section -->
        <details class="port-section depth-soundings" open>
          <summary><h2>Depth Soundings</h2></summary>
          <div class="depth-soundings-content">
            <p><strong>The engineering story:</strong> Gatun Lake exists because engineers in 1913 made a brilliant decision: instead of excavating a sea-level canal through Panama's mountains (the original French plan that failed catastrophically), they would dam the Chagres River and create a lake at 85 feet elevation. Ships would rise through locks, cross the lake, then descend on the other side. The Gatun Dam was the largest earth dam ever built. The flooded valley became a shipping channel, a water source for the locks, and—accidentally—a wildlife sanctuary.</p>

            <p><strong>Wildlife origins:</strong> When the valley flooded, animals fled to higher ground. The hilltops became islands, and these islands now teem with undisturbed wildlife. Barro Colorado Island has been protected and studied since 1923, making it one of the most intensively researched tropical forests on Earth. The surrounding waters became de facto reserves. Crocodiles that might have been hunted elsewhere thrive here under the protection of canal operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Water management:</strong> Every ship that transits the Panama Canal uses millions of gallons of Gatun Lake water, gravity-fed down through the locks. During dry seasons, water levels can drop significantly, affecting ship draft limits. The new expanded locks (opened 2016) use water-saving basins that recycle 60% of the water from each lockage. Climate change and drought conditions have occasionally restricted transit schedules—a reminder that this engineering marvel depends entirely on rainfall in the Panamanian highlands.</p>

            <p><strong>The drowned villages:</strong> Several communities were relocated when the valley flooded; others were simply abandoned. Old maps show the locations of these lost settlements. During extreme droughts, when water levels drop dramatically, ruins sometimes reappear—church steeples, foundation walls, the bones of a landscape that was sacrificed so ships could cross between oceans. It's a haunting reminder that engineering marvels have human costs.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How long does crossing Gatun Lake take?</summary>
              <p>The crossing typically takes 2-3 hours as part of the full Panama Canal transit (which lasts 8-10 hours total). Ships travel at reduced speed through the lake, providing excellent opportunities for rainforest viewing and wildlife spotting.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can you see wildlife during the transit?</summary>
              <p>Yes! From your ship you can often spot crocodiles sunning on the banks, howler monkeys in the trees, sloths, tropical birds including toucans and parrots, and even capybaras. Bring binoculars for the best viewing experience. Early morning transits typically see the most active wildlife.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do passengers get off the ship at Gatun Lake?</summary>
              <p>No—Gatun Lake is scenic cruising only. There's no port, pier, or landing. You experience everything from the ship's decks, balconies, and indoor viewing areas. This is transit, not a port call.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What should I bring for the transit?</summary>
              <p>Essential items include binoculars, camera with zoom lens, sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, and water bottles. The tropical sun reflects intensely off the water. Dress in light, breathable clothing. Extra camera batteries are wise—heat can drain them faster than expected.</p>
            </details>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Is the transit accessible for wheelchair users?</summary>
              <p>Generally yes—most ships have accessible deck viewing areas and elevators to outdoor decks. However, crowds on canal day can make navigation challenging. Contact guest services before the transit to identify the best viewing locations and any special accommodations needed.</p>
