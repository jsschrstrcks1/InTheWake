                        <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The rock climbing wall is free on every Royal Caribbean ship. No reservation needed—walk up during operating hours, sign a waiver, and climb. Multiple routes from beginner to expert. Closed-toe shoes required (available to borrow if needed). Best times: early morning or during dinner when lines are shortest.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Royal Caribbean pioneered rock climbing at sea when they introduced the first shipboard climbing wall in 1999 aboard Voyager of the Seas. Today, every ship in the fleet features at least one climbing wall, making it one of the line's signature experiences and a must-try activity for adventurous cruisers.</p>

                        <p>The walls range from 30 to 40 feet tall depending on the ship, with multiple climbing routes designed for different skill levels. What makes the experience unique isn't just the climbing—it's the setting. Scaling a wall while the ship glides through the ocean, with salt air and endless horizon around you, creates a sensation unlike any land-based climbing gym.</p>

                        <h3>Wall Features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Multiple routes from beginner (colored holds, more frequent) to expert (fewer holds, overhang sections)</li>
                            <li>Auto-belay systems for safe descents</li>
                            <li>Full harness and safety equipment provided</li>
                            <li>Trained staff supervising at all times</li>
                            <li>Located on upper Sports Deck with panoramic views</li>

                            <p>Yes, the rock climbing wall is completely complimentary and included with your cruise fare. There are no additional charges, reservations, or limits on how many times you can climb.</p>

                            <p>There's no official minimum age, but climbers must be able to wear a harness properly, which typically means at least 6 years old. There's no upper age limit as long as you're in reasonable physical condition.</p>
