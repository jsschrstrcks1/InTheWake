        <h1>Maputo: Where Portuguese Elegance Meets African Soul</h1>

        <div class="logbook-entry clearfix">
          <p>The first time I stepped ashore in Maputo, the scent hit me before anything else — grilled prawns seasoned with piri piri, mingling with salt air and jacaranda blossoms. Mozambique's capital sprawls along a natural harbor on the Indian Ocean, a city where Portuguese colonial architecture crumbles gracefully beside palm-lined avenues, where the rhythm of marrabenta music spills from open doorways, and where the seafood might be the best on Africa's entire eastern coast. This is a port that rewards the curious, the adventurous, the traveler willing to step beyond the familiar.</p>

          <p>Maputo doesn't announce itself with grand monuments or polished tourist infrastructure. Instead, it unfolds slowly, revealing layers of history — Portuguese rule that lasted until 1975, a brutal civil war that followed independence, and a resilient recovery that continues today. The city's soul lives in its contradictions: elegant wrought-iron balconies overlooking dusty streets, French patisseries next to bustling African markets, businessmen in suits sharing sidewalks with street vendors selling cashews and coconuts. It's messy and beautiful and utterly genuine.</p>

          <div class="poignant-highlight">
            <strong>The Moment That Stays With Me:</strong> Standing inside the CFM Railway Station, looking up at that magnificent copper dome designed by engineers from Gustave Eiffel's workshop. The afternoon light poured through the wrought-iron lattice, illuminating the ornate pillars and painted tiles that had somehow survived a century of tropical heat, neglect, and war. A woman swept the marble floor with a twig broom, humming. Pigeons cooed in the rafters. Outside, modern Maputo rushed past, but in that moment, I stood in 1916, when this building represented Portugal's confidence in its African empire. History isn't past tense here — it's the foundation everything else rests on.
          </div>

          <p>What surprised me most about Maputo was how good the food is. Not "good for Africa" or "good considering" — just genuinely excellent. The Portuguese brought their love of seafood preparation, the Indian Ocean provides prawns the size of small lobsters, and Mozambican cooks add piri piri peppers that make your eyes water and your taste buds sing. I've eaten at waterfront restaurants where the catch came in that morning, grilled over charcoal, served with nothing but lemon and hot sauce. Simple perfection.</p>

          <h3>Port Essentials</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">What you need to know before you dock.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> Maputo Cruise Terminal in the city harbor — basic facilities, walking distance to some attractions but taxi recommended</li>
            <li><strong>Distance to City Center:</strong> Downtown Maputo is about 2-3 km from the port; 10-15 minutes by taxi</li>
            <li><strong>Tender:</strong> No — ships dock directly at the pier</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Mozambican Metical (MZN); USD widely accepted; credit cards in upscale venues; ATMs available but not always reliable</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Portuguese (official); some English in tourist areas; many local languages including Ronga and Tsonga</li>
            <li><strong>Driving:</strong> Left side (British style); not recommended for cruise visitors — use taxis or organized tours</li>
            <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> April–November (dry season, cooler); December–March brings heat and rain</li>

          <h3>Top Experiences</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">How I'd spend my time.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">CFM Railway Station (Estação Ferroviária de Maputo)</h4>
          <p>This 1916 masterpiece designed by engineers from Gustave Eiffel's Paris workshop might be the most beautiful train station in Africa. The copper dome, ornate ironwork, painted tiles, and elegant proportions make it an architectural jewel. You can visit the main hall during operating hours — it's still a functioning station. The exterior is equally impressive and freely photographable. Located in the Baixa (lower town) district. Budget 30-45 minutes to appreciate it properly.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Casa de Ferro (Iron House)</h4>
          <p>Gustav Eiffel designed this prefabricated iron house in 1892 for the Governor of Mozambique, who took one look at this metal box in the tropical heat and refused to live in it. It now houses a museum of currency. The building itself is the main attraction — an odd, fascinating example of European engineering utterly unsuited to African climate. Located on Rua Consiglieri Pedroso near the Baixa. Small entrance fee.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora da Conceição</h4>
          <p>The oldest building in Maputo (dating to 1787), this fortress overlooks the bay from a commanding position. Originally built by the Portuguese to protect their colonial outpost, it now houses a small museum with historical artifacts and offers excellent harbor views. The thick walls and old cannons evoke centuries of maritime history. Located near the port area. Allow 1 hour for the visit.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Mercado Central (Central Market)</h4>
          <p>If you want to experience the real pulse of Maputo, come to the Central Market. This bustling maze of stalls sells everything — fresh seafood on ice, tropical fruits you've never heard of, cashews (Mozambique is a major producer), colorful capulanas (traditional fabrics), and mysterious herbal remedies. The market challenges your senses: loud, fragrant, crowded, alive. Keep your valuables secure and your camera tucked away unless you ask permission. Best visited in the morning. This is not sanitized tourism — it's genuine urban African market culture.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Inhaca Island Marine Reserve</h4>
          <p>If your ship stays all day, consider the journey to Inhaca Island, a pristine tropical island about 40 km offshore in Maputo Bay. The public ferry takes 2.5 hours each way (tight for cruise passengers), but organized speedboat tours can get you there in under an hour. The island offers white sand beaches, excellent snorkeling in the marine reserve, mangrove forests, and that rare commodity: genuine tranquility. Pack reef-safe sunscreen, snorkel gear if you have it, and cash for lunch at simple island restaurants. This is Mozambique at its most idyllic — clear turquoise water, swaying palms, and nothing to do but relax. Book through reputable tour operators.</p>

          <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--ink, #1a2a3a);">Waterfront Dining for Piri Piri Prawns</h4>
          <p>You haven't truly visited Maputo until you've eaten prawns here. The waterfront area (especially Avenida Marginal and Costa do Sol) has excellent seafood restaurants where you can watch the Indian Ocean while cracking into massive grilled prawns slathered in piri piri sauce. Restaurante Costa do Sol is legendary among locals. The prawns come fresh from the ocean, butterflied, doused in garlic and chili, and grilled over charcoal. Messy, spicy, unforgettable. Budget $15-25 per person for a seafood feast that would cost triple elsewhere. Bring cash, an appetite, and wet wipes.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Piri Piri Prawns:</strong> Maputo's signature dish — massive grilled prawns with Portuguese-style chili sauce. Spicy, garlicky, messy, magnificent.</li>
            <li><strong>Matapa:</strong> Traditional Mozambican dish of cassava leaves cooked with coconut milk, ground peanuts, and garlic — rich, earthy comfort food</li>
            <li><strong>Prego Roll:</strong> Portuguese-style steak sandwich marinated in garlic and served in crusty bread — perfect street food</li>
            <li><strong>Chamussas:</strong> Mozambican version of samosas, often filled with spiced meat or vegetables — Indian influence via Portuguese trade routes</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Coconut:</strong> Vendors along the waterfront sell coconuts cut open with machetes — refreshing natural drink</li>
            <li><strong>Tipo Tinto:</strong> Local Mozambican red wine — not world-class but honest and pairs well with seafood</li>
            <li><strong>2M and Laurentina:</strong> Local beers — light lagers perfect for the tropical heat</li>

          <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
          <p class="tiny" style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #678;">Things I learned the hard way.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Maputo requires standard urban caution. Don't display valuables, use registered taxis, stick to tourist areas during the day, and avoid walking alone at night. The tourist zone is generally safe with basic precautions.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Bring small US dollar bills — widely accepted and sometimes preferred. ATMs exist but aren't always reliable. Credit cards work in upscale venues but many places are cash-only.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Barrier:</strong> Portuguese is essential. Learn basic phrases: "Obrigado/a" (thank you), "Quanto custa?" (how much?), "Onde fica...?" (where is...?). Young people sometimes speak English.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Use registered taxi services arranged through your ship or reputable companies. Agree on the fare before getting in. Uber operates in Maputo but coverage can be spotty.</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Always ask before photographing people. Government buildings and military installations are off-limits. The Central Market is sensitive — be respectful.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Drink only bottled water. Avoid ice in drinks outside upscale venues. The seafood at good restaurants is safe — they cater to tourists and locals alike.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Maputo can be sweltering. Bring sun protection, light clothing, and stay hydrated. Many buildings lack air conditioning.</li>
          </ul>
